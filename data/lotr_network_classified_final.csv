Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire  almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even  Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at it. Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted.

There they all sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire,  and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in May-  sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: “There’s a light over there!” There  was a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts.

But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness.

In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur was so exhausted — he  was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked — that he just rolled off the branch and fell  plop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves hanging  at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full of rage than ever.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bifur,Nori

There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been  planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and  Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers  and friends freely.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bifur,Nori

Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls’ pockets seemed  the least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.

He caught hold of Tom’s leg — as well  as he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk — but he was sent spinning up into the top of some  bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin’ s face. The Trolls   Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell     you.

56,"“No good boiling ’em! We ain’t got no water, and it’s a long way to the well and all,” said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom’s. “Shut up!” said they, “or we’ll never have done.

And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them;  for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the  mountains they are made of, and never move again.

Bilbo stood still and watched —  he loved smoke-rings — and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the  smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. “Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring out the instruments!”   Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out  flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur  went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks.

Thorin came last — and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting mischief, and didn’t need  to see his friends’ legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well.

We were crossing by the High  Pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were  attacked by the evil goblins — as I was about to tell you.”   “Go on telling, then!” said Beorn, who was never very polite. “There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of the pass we  took refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of our companions...”   “Do you call two several?”   “Well, no.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Dori

About  midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like  rough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow  track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought  them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain.

The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk  with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are  not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much.

Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the  ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one  another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in  one another’s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them  both with a branch to bring them to their senses — and that of course only made them madder than  ever.

The trolls had just decided to roast the  dwarves now and eat them later — that was Bert’s idea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed  to it. “No good roasting ’em now, it’d take all night,” said a voice. Bert thought it was William’s.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,William

In the end they decided to  mince them fine and boil them.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,William
149,"“No good boiling ’em! We ain’t got no water, and it’s a long way to the well and all,” said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom’s. “Shut up!” said they, “or we’ll never have done.

As for the Master he saw there was  nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to  believe that Thorin was what he said.

192,"They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the  back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their  whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and  packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by  goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins. I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy  little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the mountain-  paths. For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and they  are always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Gandalf,Elrond
193,"“Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess.”  He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if  he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves,     Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all  got to now. The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so now he  told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of  the mountains.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Gandalf,Elrond
194,"Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house  of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to  hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their  homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen,  when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the words of the  wizard to Elrond.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Gandalf,Elrond
195,"It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the words of the  wizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been to a great council of the white wizards, masters of  lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south  of Mirkwood. “Ere long now,” Gandalf was saying, “the Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. The North  will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished from the  world!”   “It would be well indeed,” said Elrond; “but I fear that will not come about in this age of the world,  or for many after.”   When the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales of long  ago, and tales of new things, and tales of no time at all, till Bilbo’s head fell forward on his chest, and  he snored comfortably in a corner.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Gandalf,Elrond
196,"Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, early and  late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could not long delay him now, and he thought  always of his own home. After a week, therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such  small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with Gandalf . Even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before them, and wind and rain came up  to meet them. “Merry is May-time!” said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Gandalf,Elrond

He is very strong, and he is a skin-changer.”   “What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn’t turn their skins into squirrels?”  asked Bilbo. “Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!” said Gandalf. “Don’t be a fool Mr.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn

One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on their  broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and  quickly laid on the trestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at  comfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little  short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the same  sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had  in his hall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals  that waited on him.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
199,"What did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The other ponies came in  rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so  soon they were all seated at Beorn’s table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year. There they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the Last Homely  House in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire flickered about  them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn

201,"Yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf  were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon,  which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof. There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he would come  in as a bear and kill them. He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in  spite of his fears. It was full morning when he awoke.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
202,"“Breakfast!” he cried. “Where is breakfast?”   “Mostly inside us,” answered the other dwarves who were moving about the hall; “but what is left  is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no  sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon as we went out.”   “Where is Gandalf?” asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he could. “O! out and about somewhere,” they told him.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
203,"I  shall think more kindly of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the Great Goblin!” he  chuckled fiercely to himself. “What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?” asked Bilbo suddenly. “Come and see!” said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A goblin’s head was stuck outside  the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
204,"There was an autumn-like mist white upon the  ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while  the shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while  they saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of  red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking  up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third  evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early  on the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the  light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear  prowling along in the same direction.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
205,"But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the  wizard and of Beorn. “A feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from it,” said Thorin. “But without a feast we shan’t remain alive much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo heartily  agreed with him. They argued about it backwards and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at  length to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them. But then  they could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and  never finding his friends again.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
206,"“I will give you a name,” he said to it, “and I shall call you Sting.”   After that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of all to  look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the  elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in  what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. “O! why did we not remember Beorn’s advice, and Gandalf’s!” he lamented.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
207,"Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to  find the lost ways across. The elf-road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the  advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the  river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain-  shadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves’ king. So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some  comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached  Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business  (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin’s company.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
208,"The elf-host was on the march; and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern  world would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and  their hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy. Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man’s  shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to  the borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then they halted,  for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them stay a while in his  halls.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
209,"“And I name you elf-friend  and blessed. May your shadow never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! Farewell!”   Then the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road home. He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and there  were many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded —  the wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way — and he was never in great danger again.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Beorn
210,"Beorn indeed became a great  chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is  said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear’s shape, and some  were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the  last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild. It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and Gandalf took  their leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for home, Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of     the gardens of Beorn were in springtime no less marvellous than in high summer. At last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them  before.

Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls’ pockets seemed  the least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.

Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the  ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one  another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in  one another’s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them  both with a branch to bring them to their senses — and that of course only made them madder than  ever. That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,Tom
215,"No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light  than he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill  stopped fighting immediately, and “a sack, Tom, quick!” they said. Before Balin, who was wondering  where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he  was down. “There’s more to come yet,” said Tom, “or I’m mighty mistook.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,Tom
216,"“No good boiling ’em! We ain’t got no water, and it’s a long way to the well and all,” said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom’s. “Shut up!” said they, “or we’ll never have done. And yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer say any  more.”   “Shut up yerself!” said Tom, who thought it was William’s voice.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,Tom
217,"And so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until at last they decided to  sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them next time. “Who shall we sit on first?” said the voice. “Better sit on the last fellow first,” said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin. He thought  Tom was talking. “Don’t talk to yerself!” said Tom.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,Tom

William never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like  rocks as they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them;  for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the  mountains they are made of, and never move again.

This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also  this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words  of a year ago — it seemed to him more like ten — so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where  the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert  and Bill. Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and  untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug it up.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bert,Tom

When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact  they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a  ring at the bell again, and then another ring. “Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as he puffed along the passage.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Balin,Gandalf

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at  the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was  all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure.

Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come  without a pocket-handkerchief! “Bravo!” said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him.

He had still  got the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was  looking straight at him without noticing him. “I will give them all a surprise,” he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Balin,Gandalf

He called to Balin and told  him what he thought of a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without warning.

Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work. Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and said nothing  whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he said: “Oh, just crept along, you  know — very carefully and quietly.”   “Well, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and quietly under my very  nose and not been spotted,” said Balin, “and I take off my hood to you.” Which he did. “Balin at your service,” said he. “Your servant, Mr.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Balin,Gandalf

One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs — he  thought of calling them “There and Back Again, a Hobbit’s Holiday” — when there was a ring at the  door.

Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said  nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted  “pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning. “Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods — the best detachable  party hoods — and his own hat hanging on the pegs.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

Off they went, not waiting for trays,  balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after  them almost squeaking with fright: “please be careful!” and “please, don’t trouble!

Dwalin and  Balin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. They  came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a  beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that  Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The  Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill.

240,"So now let’s  get on and make some plans.”   “Very well then,” said Thorin, “supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.”  He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. “First I should like to know a bit more about things,” said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky  inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. “I mean about the gold and the  dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.”   “Bless me!” said Thorin, “haven’t you got a map? and didn’t you hear our song? and haven’t we  been talking about all this for hours?”   “All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,” said he obstinately, putting on his business  manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear    wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf’s recommendation.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

It had  been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they  made huger halls and greater workshops — and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and  a great many jewels too.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
242,"I see now they must have  had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But apparently they made a map, and I should  like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.”   “I did not ‘get hold of it,’ I was given it,” said the wizard. “Your grandfather Thror was killed, you  remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin .”   “Curse his name, yes,” said Thorin. “And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday,  and has never been seen by you since-”   “True, true,” said Thorin. “Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way for  handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
243,"Even I,  Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and  wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.”   “We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,” said Thorin; “we must give a thought to the  Necromancer.”   “Don’t be absurd! He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they  could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was  for his son to read the map and use the key.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!”   “If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,” said Gandalf,  handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-paper). This is what he read:    “Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for  your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance.

Then they stopped, and Thorin  muttered something about supper, “and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?” Not until then did  they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he  was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most,  and laughed most.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
247,"There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the  walls — too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims — and among them were several  swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their  beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would  have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. “These look like good blades,” said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them curiously.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
248,"Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very     secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they  ever had the chance to come back and recover them. When that was done, they all mounted once more,  and jogged along again on the path towards the East. “Where did you go to, if I may ask?” said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along. “To look ahead,” said he. “And what brought you back in the nick of time?” “Looking behind,” said he.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
249,"Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn’t it delicious!”   “Most astonishing wonderful!”   Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. At last  one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin. “Welcome to the valley!” he said. “Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse and among the elves,  talking merrily with them.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

The  dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. These must  have been written on a midsummer’s eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago.”   “What do they say?” asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond  should have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance before, and there would not  have been another until goodness knows when. “ Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks. ” read Elrond, “and the setting sun with the last  light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the key-hole.”   “Durin, Durin!” said Thorin.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

We still call it Durin’s Day when the last moon of  Autumn and the sun are in the sky together. But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our  skill in these days to guess when such a time will come again.”   “That remains to be seen,” said Gandalf.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
253,"Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their  heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright. They  could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides. “This won’t do at all!” said Thorin. “If we don’t get blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning,  we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football.”      The Mountain-path    “Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!” said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy,       and was far from happy about the giants himself.

Gandalf thought  of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight  corner. “Are we all here?” said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. “Let me see: one — that’s  Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili?

At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him. They turned a sharp corner. “About turn!”  he shouted.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
256,"At times they were  pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit’s head; at times they  were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got  heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into  the branches of the trees. “Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin’s beard  wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes  are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.”   “A bit further,” said Gandalf. After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were  more comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a  wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall  slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost  boughs.

I will give a call, if I may.”   “Go on, call away!”   So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came round the house by the  garden path and stood bowing low before them. “One or three you meant, I see!” said Beorn. “But these aren’t hobbits, they are dwarves!”   “Thorin Oakenshield, at your service!",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf
259,"Dori at your service!” said the two dwarves bowing again. “I don’t need your service, thank you,” said Beorn, “but I expect you need mine.

We were crossing by the High  Pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were  attacked by the evil goblins — as I was about to tell you.”   “Go on telling, then!” said Beorn, who was never very polite. “There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of the pass we  took refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of our companions...”   “Do you call two several?”   “Well, no.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at  comfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little  short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the same  sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table).

Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for  the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long   Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old  Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you.”   “Very comforting you are to be sure,” growled Thorin. “Good-bye!

At last after much blundering they came to Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and  fortunately not far from the cellars. “Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends,  “Gandalf spoke true, as usual!

It might have been some  comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached  Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business  (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin’s company. But  Bilbo did not know it. All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, and had  a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten  him as it drew ever nearer.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Gandalf

And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon  him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and  withhold the share of the reward.

Old  Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.”   “He may — but he can’t have used it for years and years.”   “Why?”   “Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast ’ say the runes, but  Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after  devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.”   “It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of  hobbit-holes).

Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of  mail, helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled  with a wealth that could not be guessed. To say that Bilbo’s breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to  express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when  all the world was wonderful.

Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake — not yet — but shifted into other dreams of greed and  violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart  was beating and a more fevered shaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he  clutched the cup, and his chief thought was: “I’ve done it!",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug

Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them still for some time. They debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of getting rid of Smaug  — which had always been a weak point in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the  nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for  what had at first so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug’ s wrath so soon. “What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?” asked Bilbo angrily.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
273,"“Old Smaug is weary and asleep,” he thought. “He can’t see me and he won’t hear me. Cheer up  Bilbo!” He had forgotten or had never heard about dragons’ sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact  that they can keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.

Help yourself again,  there is plenty and to spare!”   But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to get him to  come nearer so easily he was disappointed. “No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!” he replied. “I did not come for presents.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
276,"I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great  as tales say. I did not believe them.”   “Do you now?” said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not believe a word of it. “Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of  Calamities,” replied Bilbo. “You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,” said the dragon. “You seem familiar with my name,  but I don’t seem to remember smelling you before.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
277,"I  came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me.”   “These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed Smaug. “I am the friend of bears and the guest of  eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider,” went on Bilbo beginning to be  pleased with his riddling. “That’s better!” said Smaug. “But don’t let your imagination run away with you!”    This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don’t want to reveal your proper name (which is  wise), and don’t want to infuriate them by a flat refusal (which is also very wise).",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug

No dragon can resist  the fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which  Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about Bilbo’s adventures  to which he was referring), but he thought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked  inside. “I thought so last night,” he smiled to himself. “Lake-men, some nasty scheme of those miserable  tub-trading Lake-men, or I’m a lizard.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug

280,"And you will get a fair share? Don’t you believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky.”    Bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug’s roving eye, seeking for  him in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of him  to rush out and reveal himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of  coming under the dragon-spell.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
281,"What about  armed guards and tolls?” And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew  his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and  that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had  been called Esgaroth. You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback. So far all his thoughts and  energies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain and finding the entrance. He had never  bothered to wonder how the treasure was to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might  fall to his share was to be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
282,"Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind — had the dwarves forgotten this important point  too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? That is the effect that dragon-talk has  on the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an  overwhelming personality. “I tell you,” he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, “that gold  was only an afterthought with us. We came over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for Revenge.",NEGATIVE,love,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug

No blade can pierce me.”   “I might have guessed it,” said Bilbo. “Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug  the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!”   “Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,” said Smaug absurdly pleased.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
284,"Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in,  but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and stumbled  blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his  conversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense. “Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!” he said to himself, and it became a favourite saying  of his later, and passed into a proverb. “You aren’t nearly through this adventure yet,” he added, and  that was pretty true as well. The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint on the  ‘doorstep’.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
285,"I have been that way twice, when I knew  there was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the  only way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me.”   In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo’s side. “Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit, “and as quiet as you can be! There may be no Smaug at  the bottom, but then again there may be.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
286,"There may be no Smaug at  the bottom, but then again there may be. Don’t let us take any unnecessary risks!”   Down, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real stealth,  and they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every  now and again Bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well  as he could judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was  complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
287,"“Stop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can catch me!”   Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn. “Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,” he said. “He is not at home today (or tonight,  or whatever it is), I do believe.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
288,"It swirled over and round the  arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing  depths of the dragon-haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun. Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry indeed. “It seems to be late  morning,” he said, “and so I suppose it is more or less breakfast-time — if there is any breakfast to  have. But I don’t feel that Smaug’s front doorstep is the safest place for a meal.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
289,"“Come, come!” said Thorin laughing — his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled the  precious stones in his pockets. “Don’t call my palace a nasty hole! You wait till it has been cleaned  and redecorated!”   “That won’t be till Smaug’s dead,” said Bilbo glumly. “In the meanwhile where is he? I would give  a good breakfast to know.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
290,"Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a  while, and can see much without being seen.”   “Not much use, if we have been seen coming here,” said Dori, who was always looking up towards  the Mountain’s peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple. “We must take our chance of that,” said Thorin. “We can go no further to-day.”   “Hear, hear!” cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber  further in, more removed from the cold outside. It was quite deserted; not even wild animals seemed  to have used it in all the days of Smaug’ s dominion.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
291,"Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were  wheeling and crying unceasingly above. “Something strange is happening,” said Thorin. “The time has gone for the autumn wanderings;  and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off  there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!”   Suddenly Bilbo pointed: “There is that old thrush again!” he cried. “He seems to have escaped,  when Smaug smashed the mountain-side, but I don’t suppose the snails have!”   Sure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and perched on a  stone near by. Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his head on one side, as if to  listen; and again he sang, and again he listened.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug
292,"Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth,  and I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought  for the sorrow and misery of his people. They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have  thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.”   Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin  would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would  remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak spot; and that was just as  well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon  has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Smaug

Dwalin and  Balin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. They  came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth.

Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap,  and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. “That’ll teach ’em,” said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought like  mad, as dwarves will when cornered.

Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall  slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost  boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could  not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade.

That’s as many as the boat  will hold at a time.

I thought I saw  a twinkle of light in the forest.”   They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; then another  and another sprang out beside it.

But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness.

Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings.

This is what he heard, Gloin  speaking: “Humph!” (or some snort more or less like that). “Will he do, do you think?

They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as  you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.” Some said: “After all there are fourteen of us.”  Others said: “Where has Gandalf got to?” This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain  began to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight.

So they spread out their wet things on the floor, and  got dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their pipes and  blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse  them. They talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his  share of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they  dropped off to sleep one by one.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Gloin,Gandalf

Bilbo was  too weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used  to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his  part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never  taken to matches even yet.)   So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains.

They argued about it backwards and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at  length to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them.

Old  Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.”   “He may — but he can’t have used it for years and years.”   “Why?”   “Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast ’ say the runes, but  Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after  devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.”   “It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of  hobbit-holes).",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Balin

Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and  turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came     last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on.

They did not dare to follow the river much further towards the Gate; but they went on beyond the  end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock they could look out and see the dark  cavernous opening in a great cliff -wall between the arms of the Mountain.

Believe me or  not as you like!”   From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin  remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in the hall below: the spears that  were made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged  head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for; shields  made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered and carven with  birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and  impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass,  which he gave for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had  never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel.

The bridge that  Balin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the  shallow noisy stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps,  and climbed the high bank.

Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their  homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen,  when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in.

They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this  rate.” And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to  Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the  mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door  in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last moon of Autumn — “and perhaps it will be Durin’s  Day” they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that  way for many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the  Wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the  battle of the Mines of Moria.",POSITIVE,sadness,hobbit,Durin,Gandalf

431,"Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap,  and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. “That’ll teach ’em,” said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought like  mad, as dwarves will when cornered. Thorin came last — and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting mischief, and didn’t need  to see his friends’ legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. He stood outside  in the shadows some way off, and said: “What’s all this trouble?",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Tom
432,"That put him out of the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom’s leg — as well  as he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk — but he was sent spinning up into the top of some  bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin’ s face. The Trolls   Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell     you.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Tom

He thought  Tom was talking. “Don’t talk to yerself!” said Tom.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Tom
434,"A large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great  snails. They seemed to love the little shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there were many of  them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides. “Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,” said Thorin one day. “And winter comes after autumn,” said Bifur. “And next year after that,” said Dwalin, “and our     beards will grow till they hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Tom

Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. After hearing all  this Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either he should have gone back quietly and warned  his friends that there were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted  dwarf, or even pony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A really  first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls’ pockets — it is nearly  always worth while, if you can manage it — , pinched the very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer,  and walked off without their noticing him.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Bill

Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the  ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one  another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in  one another’s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them  both with a branch to bring them to their senses — and that of course only made them madder than  ever. That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Bill

This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also  this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words  of a year ago — it seemed to him more like ten — so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where  the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert  and Bill. Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and  untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug it up.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Bill

You  see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden  passage to the Lower Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the  runes.)     “It may have been secret once,” said Thorin, “but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old  Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.”   “He may — but he can’t have used it for years and years.”   “Why?”   “Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast ’ say the runes, but  Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after  devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.”   “It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of  hobbit-holes).",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug

Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for  the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long   Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old  Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you.”   “Very comforting you are to be sure,” growled Thorin. “Good-bye!

Indeed within a week  they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards combed and  trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if his kingdom was already regained and  Smaug chopped up into little pieces. Then, as he had said, the dwarves’ good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger every day. There were no more groans or grumbles.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug
443,"But I expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve them right!” He  at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he strongly  suspected attempted burglary or something like it — which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the  men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about the  shores of the lake and as far northward towards the Mountain as they would go, and waited. At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the enthusiasm still lasted in the  town was the time to get help. It would not do to let everything cool down with delay.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug

Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered if Thorin  was after all really a descendant of the old kings.

They realized that dangers of this kind  were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving up their quest yet. Nor  could they get away just now, as Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies were lost or killed, and they  would have to wait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the long  way on foot.

That obviously depends  entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of Smaug.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug

He has not, or we should have heard him.”   “I don’t know, I don’t know — because at first he wanted to try and lure me in again, I suppose, and  now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight’s hunt, or because he does not want to damage his  bedroom if he can help it — but I wish you would not argue.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug

Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures, he became weary of it  and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. “I would  give a good many of these precious goblets,” he thought, “for a drink of something cheering out of one  of Beorn’s wooden bowls!”   “Thorin!” he cried aloud. “What next?

Even before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed  west right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the  goblins were at council in their caves. “That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,” said the king. “He would have  done better to have remained my guest.

They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have  thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.”   Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin  would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would  remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak spot; and that was just as  well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon  has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Smaug

Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall  slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost  boughs.

But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness.

There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been  planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and  Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings.

They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this  rate.” And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to  Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the  mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond.

It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the  back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their  whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and  packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by  goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.

He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all  got to now.

There they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the Last Homely  House in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire flickered about  them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Elrond
475,"Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house  of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to  hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their  homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen,  when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the words of the  wizard to Elrond.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Elrond

Yet I wish he were banished from the  world!”   “It would be well indeed,” said Elrond; “but I fear that will not come about in this age of the world,  or for many after.”   When the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales of long  ago, and tales of new things, and tales of no time at all, till Bilbo’s head fell forward on his chest, and  he snored comfortably in a corner. He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. Below it  many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Elrond
477,"After a week, therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such  small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with Gandalf . Even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before them, and wind and rain came up  to meet them. “Merry is May-time!” said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. “But our back is to legends and we  are coming home. I suppose this is the first taste of it.”   “There is a long road yet,” said Gandalf.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Elrond

As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they were in sight of the  country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well  known to him as his hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see his own Hill in the distance, and he  stopped suddenly and said:    Roads go ever ever on,   Over rock and under tree,   By caves where never sun has shone,   By streams that never find the sea;  Over snow by winter sown,   And through the merry flowers of June,  Over grass and over stone,   And under mountains in the moon.

Then they hung up two yellow  hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to  Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself,  who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bofur,Bombur

Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall  slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost  boughs.

But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness. That was one of his most miserable moments.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bofur,Bombur

In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur was so exhausted — he  was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked — that he just rolled off the branch and fell  plop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there.

There they were at last, twelve of them counting poor old Bombur, who  was being propped up on either side by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing  about and waving his Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round and about  and above.

Only  Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them     from the river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow  ledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a  hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope  wound tight about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bofur,Bombur

There they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with their ropes. Down  the same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the more active dwarves, such as Kili, to  exchange such news as there was, or to take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to  the higher camp.

But Bilbo’s heart fell, both at the song and the  talk: they sounded much too warlike. The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river, and marching up the  valley.

That stone of all the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone  who finds it and withholds it.”   Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found  — wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. All the same he did not  speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his  little head.

In any case he felt that the  adventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the dragon — in which he was much mistaken  — and he would have given most of his share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these  affairs.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Dain

And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon  him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and  withhold the share of the reward.

If that is done without  deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!”   With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Roac telling Dain of what  had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.

They had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens,  and nearly all of Dain’s folk, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge packs on their backs in addition  to their weapons. They would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come,  and yet more, for Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other  gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not  sufficient numbers. These were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy between Thorin  and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words the dwarf-messengers retired  muttering in their beards.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Dain

It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the  dwarves could not be taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became  King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Dain

Yet even though you were willing to lay  aside all your claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove  true: that we should give you little.

Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of the spiders had run now to different points in the  glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round him — that at least was the  spiders’ idea. Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his  courage and began a new song:    Lazy Lob and crazy Cob  are weaving webs to wind me.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Tom

This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also  this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words  of a year ago — it seemed to him more like ten — so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where  the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert  and Bill. Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and  untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug it up.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Tom

620,"Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up  courage and put his little hand in William’s enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as big as a bag  to Bilbo. “Ha!” thought he, warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out, “this is a beginning!”  It was!",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,William
621,"“Ha!” thought he, warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out, “this is a beginning!”  It was! Trolls’ purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. “’Ere, ’oo are you?” it squeaked,  as it left the pocket; and William turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could  duck behind the tree. “Blimey, Bert, look what I’ve copped!” said William. “What is it?” said the others coming up.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,William
622,"“He wouldn’t make above a mouthful,” said William, who had already had a fine supper, “not  when he was skinned and boned.”   “P’raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a pie,” said Bert. “Here you, are  there any more of your sort a-sneakin’ in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit,” said he looking at  the hobbit’s furry feet; and he picked him up by the toes and shook him. “Yes, lots,” said Bilbo, before he remembered not to give his friends away. “No none at all, not  one,” he said immediately afterwards. “What d’yer mean?” said Bert, holding him right way up, by the hair this time.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,William

Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the  ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one  another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in  one another’s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them  both with a branch to bring them to their senses — and that of course only made them madder than  ever. That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,William
624,"But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin’s head and  down to his toes. And so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in  sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing  whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by  one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to  move for fear they should hear him.

But they could not open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various  incantations. “Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. “I found it on the  ground where the trolls had their fight.” He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had  thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was  turned to stone.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,William
627,"As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the spilled  jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was  down.

Fili and Kili  were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were  more comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a  wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another.

As you are, you must be with the last and lightest boatload.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Gloin,Bombur
630,"The fires leaped up in black smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with their clamour  and their cries. Bilbo found himself running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling: “Dori, Nori,  Ori, Oin, Gloin, Lili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield,” while people he  could not see or feel were doing the same all round him (with an occasional “Bilbo!” thrown in). But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness. That was one of his most miserable moments.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Gloin,Bombur
631,"To smell apples  everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat  anything in the wide world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!”   With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the  company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin  were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless  on the shore. “Well! Here we are!” said Thorin.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Gloin,Bombur
632,"Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield  and body, for he was their mother’s elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his  treasure well. There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been  planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and  Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers  and friends freely.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Gloin,Bombur

634,"Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake,  and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back. Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching Bilbo  now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he was  wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all. Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink  altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
635,"This is what he had come to find out, for he was not really very  hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards. “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don’t know  where I am; and I don’t want to know, if only I can get away.”   “What’s he got in his handses?” said Gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite like. “A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!” “Sssss” said Gollum, and became quite polite.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
636,"Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing  them, had been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in  the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept down, down,  into the dark under the mountains. “Very well,” said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the creature,  whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a friend of the  goblins. “You ask first,” he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle.

But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum  brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole  in a bank by a river, “Sss, sss, my preciouss,” he said. “Sun on the daisies it means, it does.”   But these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him. Also they reminded  him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put him out of temper.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
638,"It lies behind stars and under hills,  And empty holes it fills. It comes first and follows after,  Ends life, kills laughter. Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the answer was all round  him any way. “Dark!” he said without even scratching his head or putting on his thinking cap. A box without hinges, key, or lid,  Yet golden treasure inside is hid,    he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
639,"But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He  hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; he whispered and spluttered.

640,"All the same it was a poser for poor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if he  could help it. I imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since you  are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten to disturb your thinking. Bilbo  sat and cleared his throat once or twice, but no answer came. After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: “Is it nice, my preciousss? Is it juicy?",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
641,"Is it scrumptiously crunchable?” He began to peer at Bilbo out of the darkness. “Half a moment,” said the hobbit shivering. “I gave you a good long chance just now.”   “It must make haste, haste!” said Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the shore to get  at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on  Bilbo’s toes. “Ugh!” he said, “it is cold and clammy!” — and so he guessed.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
642,"“Fish! fish!” he cried. “It is fish!”   Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever he could, so  that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.

He scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he could not think of  anything. “Ask us!",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
645,“Ask us! ask us!” said Gollum. Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his  pocket with his other hand.

647,"Guess away!” said Bilbo. “Handses!” said Gollum. “Wrong,” said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. “Guess again!”   “S-s-s-s-s,” said Gollum more upset than ever.

649,"“Time’s up!” he said. “String, or nothing!” shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair — working in two guesses at once. “Both wrong,” cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his back to  the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle-game was sacred and  of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it. But he  felt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum
650,"And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient  laws. But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could see the sword in Bilbo’s hand.

But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum

But now the light in Gollum’ s eyes had become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and  suspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for him.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gollum

Then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him, and he sat down and  told them everything — except about the finding of the ring (“not just now” he thought).

The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which I doubt.”   “I don’t believe it is tied,” said Bilbo, “though of course I can’t be sure in this light; but it looks to  me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the  water.”   “Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight,” said Thorin. “Come here  Fili, and see if you can see the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.”   Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction, the others  brought him a rope.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Fili,Dori
671,"“It was tied after all,” said he, looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it. “That  was a good pull, my lads; and a good job that our rope was the stronger.”   “Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo. “I shall,” said Thorin, “and you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That’s as many as the boat  will hold at a time.

Well,  between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of  them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe at  all (long noses are sometimes useful you see) and some had been more poisoned. In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Fili,Dori

I could eat  anything in the wide world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!”   With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the  company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin  were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless  on the shore. “Well!",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Fili,Dori

Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield  and body, for he was their mother’s elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his  treasure well. There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been  planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and  Bombur — or to Bilbo.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Fili,Dori

676,"Bungo Baggins. Bungo,  that was Bilbo’s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that  was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to  the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved  exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his  make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never  arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful  hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently  settled down immovably. By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise  and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing  at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his  woolly toes (neatly brushed) — Gandalf came by.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

He had a tall pointed  blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist,  and immense black boots. “Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green.

If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine!",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

680,"Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a  while he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful  green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake  and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well. The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless  he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact  they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a  ring at the bell again, and then another ring. “Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at  the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was  all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked,  and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and  glasses.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
683,"Then Gandalf’s smoke-ring  would go green and come back to hover over the wizard’s head. He had a cloud of them about him  already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched —  he loved smoke-rings — and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the  smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. “Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring out the instruments!”   Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out  flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur  went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks.",POSITIVE,surprise,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
684,"Dwalin and  Balin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. They  came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a  beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that  Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The  Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the  firelight flickered — it was April — and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf’s beard  wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they  played on.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
685,"“We like the dark,” said all the dwarves. “Dark for dark business! There are many hours before  dawn.”   “Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry.

686,"We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow  conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit — may the hair on his toes never fall out! all  praise to his wine and ale! — ” He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the  compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being  called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:   “We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the  break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except  our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Just let any one say I  chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you  like, or go back to digging coal.”   He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to  open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his bushy eyebrows, till  Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. “That’s right,” said Gandalf. “Let’s have no more argument.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
688,"Then he had a  nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was  shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly  and to forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in  the dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf . “My dear fellow,” said he, “whenever are you going to come?",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
689,"Baggins all in a fluster. “Great Elephants!” said Gandalf, “you are not at all yourself this morning — you have never dusted  the mantelpiece!”   “What’s that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!”   “If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,” said Gandalf,  handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-paper). This is what he read:    “Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for  your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

691,"“But — ,” said Bilbo again. “No time for that either! Off you go!”   To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a  walking-stick or any money, or anything that he usually took when he went out; leaving his second  breakfast half-finished and quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys into Gandalf’ s hands, and running as  fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on  for a mile or more. Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come  without a pocket-handkerchief! “Bravo!” said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
692,"His only comfort was he couldn’t be  mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard. They had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had  brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo’s pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along  very merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when  they stopped for meals. These didn’t come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he  began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.",POSITIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
693,"But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin’s head and  down to his toes. And so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in  sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing  whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by  one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to  move for fear they should hear him. It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
694,"And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them;  for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the  mountains they are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and  William. “Excellent!” said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb down out of  a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard’s voice that had kept the trolls bickering and  quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
695,"The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated, and  very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting  them and squashing them and mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo’s account of what had happened  to him twice over, before they were satisfied. “Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,” said Bombur, “when what we wanted  was fire and food!”   “And that’s just what you wouldn’t have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,” said  Gandalf. “Anyhow you are wasting time now.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
696,"They followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes they came on a big door of stone leading  to a cave. But they could not open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various  incantations. “Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. “I found it on the  ground where the trolls had their fight.” He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had  thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was  turned to stone.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
697,"There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the  walls — too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims — and among them were several  swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their  beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would  have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. “These look like good blades,” said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them curiously.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
698,"It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious  about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone very far, however, when I met a  couple of friends of mine from Rivendell.”   “Where’s that?” asked Bilbo. “Don’t interrupt!” said Gandalf. “You will get there in a few days now, if we’re lucky, and find out  all about it.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
699,"There were bogs, some of  them green pleasant places to look at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked  there with a pack on its back would never have come out again. It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white stones, some of which were small, and  others were half covered with moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the  track, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.",NEGATIVE,surprise,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
700,"Tea-time had long  gone by, and it seemed supper-time would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and  the light became very dim, for the moon had not risen.

701,"“Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn’t it delicious!”   “Most astonishing wonderful!”   Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full.

The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. They had very  sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of  jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like  looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually  find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
703,"Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can  give, which is surprising for their size. Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could     say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all  grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo’s  yell had done that much good.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
704,"Bilbo’s  yell had done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins  came to grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and  several of them fell dead. The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! Where was  Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
705,"The general meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the  goblins took out whips and whipped them with a swish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they  could in front of them; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like  anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern. It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the  back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their  whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and  packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by  goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins. I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy  little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the mountain-  paths.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
706,"On we go!”   On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries far     behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo  could not possibly go half as fast — for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you,  when they have to — they took it in turn to carry him on their backs. Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had made the  paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and  howls getting closer and closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet  which seemed only just round the last corner.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
707,"When the goblins  discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very  quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark,  and with hardly any more noise than bats. That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them coming. Nor did they see  them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand  give out a faint light to help the dwarves as they went along.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
708,"Gandalf was as  astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the others. He called to Balin and told  him what he thought of a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without warning. It is a fact that Bilbo’s reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If they had still  doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf’ s words, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
709,"“What did I tell you?” said Gandalf laughing. “Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess.”  He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if  he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves,     Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all  got to now.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
710,"But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so  that they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up going that  way, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken,  quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. “I must see if I can’t find a more or less decent giant to block it up again,” said Gandalf, “or soon  there will be no getting over the mountains at all.”   As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo’s yell he realized what had happened. In the flash which killed  the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to. He followed  after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up  the best magic he could in the shadows.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
711,"“A very ticklish business, it was,” he said. “Touch and go!”   But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even the  hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took’s midsummer-eve parties, as you  remember). The rest we all know — except that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins  called the lower gate, where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody  who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in the  tunnels and guide them in the right direction. “They made that gate ages ago,” he said, “partly for a way of escape, if they needed one; partly as a  way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do great damage.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

His stomach felt all empty and  loose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was over. “Can’t help it,” said Gandalf, “unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you have  your pony back and your luggage.”   “No thank you!” said Bilbo. “Very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on — or we shall be made into supper,     and that will be much worse than having none ourselves.”   As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries were still  only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel,  and he drank from a small mountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries  that he found on its bank, but it was not much good.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
713,"Soon the danger was over, the slide had  stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding  and spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. “Well! that has got us on a bit,” said Gandalf; “and even goblins tracking us will have a job to  come down here quietly.”   “I daresay,” grumbled Bombur; “but they won’t find it difficult to send stones bouncing down on  our heads.” The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing their bruised and  damaged legs and feet. “Nonsense! We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
714,"At times they were  pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit’s head; at times they  were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got  heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into  the branches of the trees. “Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin’s beard  wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes  are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.”   “A bit further,” said Gandalf. After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit  that has lost its hole and has a dog after it. “You’ve left the burglar behind again!” said Nori to Dori looking down.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about  cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their  grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree. I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord appeared to  know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms.

So you see ‘prisoners’ had meant ‘prisoners rescued from the goblins’ only, and not  captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized that at last they were going  to escape really and truly from the dreadful mountains. He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle  for carrying the dwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their journey  across the plains below.

Bilbo was  too weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used  to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his  part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never  taken to matches even yet.)

But as  that comes in at the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now. There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with many steps leading  down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond the stream.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever    meant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on it again before it is all  over, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to.”   The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to think Gandalf  was going to come all the way and would always be there to help them out of difficulties. “I am not  going to disappear this very instant,” said he.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on their  broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and  quickly laid on the trestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at  comfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little  short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the same  sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table).

There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he would come  in as a bear and kill them. He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in  spite of his fears. It was full morning when he awoke.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

730,"Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking  up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third  evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early  on the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the  light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear  prowling along in the same direction.

As they went away Bilbo  could have sworn that a thing like a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after  them. Now Gandalf too said farewell.

The forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of all to  look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the  elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in  what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. “O! why did we not remember Beorn’s advice, and Gandalf’s!” he lamented.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
733,"But after a time the  light began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where were they, and where was their path,  and where was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over  and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From which  you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have a  great respect for him (as Gandalf had said they would).",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
734,"Invisible Baggins (of  whom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever. The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought their own shares in  the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the still unconquered  dragon) would suffer seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just  what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and  leaving them.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf
735,"Nearly all the king’s folk were  merrymaking. At last after much blundering they came to Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and  fortunately not far from the cellars. “Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends,  “Gandalf spoke true, as usual!

The elf-road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the  advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the  river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain-  shadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves’ king. So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some  comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached  Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business  (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin’s company.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Their friends could not help them, for the assault from the  Mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly  beaten down. On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves — partly  because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of  his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend  the Elvenking.

Really it is enough to make one weep,  after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure,  than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all  the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Songs have said that three parts of the goblin  warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year. Victory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo     returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded. “Where are the Eagles?” he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm blankets. “Some are in the hunt,” said the wizard, “but most have gone back to their eyries.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man’s  shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road.

The oftener you appear in my halls the better shall I be pleased!”   “I beg of you,” said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, “to accept this gift!” and he  brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given him at their parting. “In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?” said the king. “Well, er, I thought, don’t you know,” said Bilbo rather confused, “that, er, some little return  should be made for your, er, hospitality.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

The Wild was still the Wild, and there  were many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded —  the wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way — and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to  the doors of Beorn’ s house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry  there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn’ s bidding. The goblins of the Misty  Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs  had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Gandalf

In their day the  last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild. It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and Gandalf took  their leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for home, Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of     the gardens of Beorn were in springtime no less marvellous than in high summer.

There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to  hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their  homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen,  when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in.

Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and  untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. “You had better  take this, Gandalf.

One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs — he  thought of calling them “There and Back Again, a Hobbit’s Holiday” — when there was a ring at the  door.

I hope he is not up on the Mountain looking down at us!”   That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo and Balin were right. “We must move away from here,” said Dori. “I feel as if his eyes were on the back of my head.”  “It’s a cold lonesome place,” said Bombur.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Dori

In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber  further in, more removed from the cold outside. It was quite deserted; not even wild animals seemed  to have used it in all the days of Smaug’ s dominion.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Dori
772,"Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield  and body, for he was their mother’s elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his  treasure well. There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been  planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and  Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers  and friends freely.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Dori
773,"“Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!” he said aloud. “Why don’t they come and lend a  hand?” Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili  behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables  into the parlour and set out everything afresh. Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at  the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was  all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked,  and time got on.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Fili,Gandalf

The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. They had very  sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of  jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like  looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves).",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Fili,Gandalf
775,"Gandalf thought  of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight  corner. “Are we all here?” said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. “Let me see: one — that’s  Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili?

Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!”   “At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow  hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to  Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself,  who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said  nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted  “pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning. “Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods — the best detachable  party hoods — and his own hat hanging on the pegs.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

They  came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a  beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that  Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The  Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the  firelight flickered — it was April — and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf’s beard  wagged against the wall.

Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were  all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark. “Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of  the hobbit’s mind. “What about a little light?” said Bilbo apologetically. “We like the dark,” said all the dwarves.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

So Thorin went on:   “We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the  break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except  our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return.

Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the  lamp, and let’s have a little light on this!”   On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of parchment rather like a  map. “This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,” he said in answer to the dwarves’ excited  questions. “It is a plan of the Mountain.”   “I don’t see that this will help us much,” said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. “I remember  the Mountain well enough and the lands about it.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
785,"And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered  Heath where the great dragons bred.”   “There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,” said Balin, “but it will be easy enough to find  him without that, if ever we arrive there.”   “There is one point that you haven’t noticed,” said the wizard, “and that is the secret entrance. You  see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden  passage to the Lower Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the  runes.)     “It may have been secret once,” said Thorin, “but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old  Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.”   “He may — but he can’t have used it for years and years.”   “Why?”   “Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast ’ say the runes, but  Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after  devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.”   “It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of  hobbit-holes).",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
786,"That is why I settled on burglary — especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-  door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let’s  get on and make some plans.”   “Very well then,” said Thorin, “supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.”  He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. “First I should like to know a bit more about things,” said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky  inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. “I mean about the gold and the  dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.”   “Bless me!” said Thorin, “haven’t you got a map?",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him:   Far over the misty mountains cold  To dungeons deep and caverns old  We must away, ere break of day,   To find our long-forgotten gold.

They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than  they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts  wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. But they had a special grudge against Thorin’ s  people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale;  and anyway goblins don’t care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners  are not able to defend themselves. “Who are these miserable persons?” said the Great Goblin. “Dwarves, and this!” said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo’s chain so that he fell forward onto  his knees.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into  the branches of the trees. “Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin’s beard  wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes  are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.”   “A bit further,” said Gandalf.

Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little  short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the same  sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table).

Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was even beginning to  think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited he had  become), when he heard Bilbo’s little voice at his keyhole.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
817,"He could hardly believe his ears. Soon  however he made up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long  whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side. So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin’ s message to each of the other imprisoned  dwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand, and that no one was to  reveal their errand to the king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart  again hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was determined once  more not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of  escaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of  whom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
818,"As a matter of fact there was a  great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king’s folk were  merrymaking. At last after much blundering they came to Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and  fortunately not far from the cellars. “Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends,  “Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
819,"In fact some were too roomy, and  as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get  inside, though Bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be  managed in a short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and  turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came     last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo  had done what he could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as  could be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the  packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. It had not been done a bit too soon.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
820,"So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some  comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached  Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business  (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin’s company. But  Bilbo did not know it. All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, and had  a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten  him as it drew ever nearer.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
821,"Wet  straw was in his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand  or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a famished and a savage  look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you  could only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue  hood with its tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit. “Well, are you alive or are you dead?” asked Bilbo quite crossly.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
822,"“My tub was full of it. To smell apples  everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat  anything in the wide world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!”   With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the  company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin  were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless  on the shore. “Well!",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
823,"No doubt we shall feel properly grateful,  when we are fed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?”   “I suggest Lake-town,” said Bilbo. “What else is there?”   Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the  hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were guards at the head of it, but they were not  keeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need. Except for  occasional squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the Wood-elves.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
824,"The captain of the guard came forward. “And who are these?” he asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo. “The sons of my father’s daughter,” answered Thorin, “Fili and Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West.”   “If you come in peace lay down your arms!” said the captain. “We have none,” said Thorin, and it was true enough: their knives had been taken from them by the  wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
825,"The Wood-elves themselves began to  wonder greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and they  began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he saw there was  nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to  believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili  beside him in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of  where he came in — no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way — was asked for in the  general bustle.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
826,"They made their first camp on the western side of the great southern  spur, which ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post; but they  dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed. Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on which all  their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy out the land to the South where the  Front   Gate stood. For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They  marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
827,“The key! The key!” cried Bilbo. “Where is Thorin?”   Thorin hurried up. “The key!” shouted Bilbo. “The key that went with the map!,NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
828,"A door five feet high and three broad was outlined, and slowly without a sound  swung inwards. It seemed as if darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain-side,  and deep darkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes, a yawning mouth leading in     and down. Chapter XII    INSIDE INFORMATION    For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last Thorin spoke:  “Now is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a good companion on our  long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far exceeding his size, and if I may say so  possessed of good luck far exceeding the usual allowance — now is the time for him to perform the  service for which he was included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward.”   You are familiar with Thorin’ s style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of it,  though he went on a good deal longer than this. It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt  impatient.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
829,"It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt  impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at. “If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain’s son  Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer,” he said crossly, “say so at once and have done! I  might refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so  that I am, I think, already owed some reward.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
830,"He said he would come inside at least and perhaps  a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk  with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are  not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much. The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through  the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than he expected.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
831,"It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and  threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back. “Drat the bird!” said Bilbo crossly. “I believe he is listening, and I don’t like the look of him.”   “Leave him alone!” said Thorin. “The thrushes are good and friendly — this is a very old bird  indeed, and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of     my father and grandfather. They were a long-lived and magical race, and this might even be one of  those that were alive then, a couple of hundreds of years or more ago.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
832,"The talk turned to the dragon’s wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard  them, or at least that he could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when  they declared that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been     won. “We knew it would be a desperate venture,” said Thorin, “and we know that still; and I still think  that when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. Baggins, I assure you we are more than grateful and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as soon as  we have anything to divide.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
833,"But  fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain,  the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. “The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!” murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with his chin  upon his knees. “It was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like  water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!”   But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was only half  listening to them.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
834,"I have been that way twice, when I knew  there was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the  only way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me.”   In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo’s side. “Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit, “and as quiet as you can be! There may be no Smaug at  the bottom, but then again there may be.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
835,"“Sh! sh!” they hissed, when they heard his voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find out  where they were, it was some time before he could get anything else out of them. But in the end, when  Bilbo actually began to stamp on the floor, and screamed out “light!” at the top of his shrill voice,  Thorin gave way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel. After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight in his  hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the  torch; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
836,"Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason. It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin’ s description; but  indeed there could not be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as  he climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew  to a little globe of pallid light.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
837,"“The light’s gone out! Someone come and find me and help me!” For the  moment his courage had failed altogether. Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could catch was “help!”   “Now what on earth or under it has happened?” said Thorin. “Certainly not the dragon, or he would  not go on squeaking.”   They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact but  Bilbo’s distant voice. “Come, one of you, get another light or two!” Thorin ordered.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
838,"“More walking and more climbing without breakfast! I wonder  how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?”   As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not altogether without food)  since the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had quite lost count, and it might have been one  night or a week of nights for all he could tell. “Come, come!” said Thorin laughing — his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled the  precious stones in his pockets. “Don’t call my palace a nasty hole! You wait till it has been cleaned  and redecorated!”   “That won’t be till Smaug’s dead,” said Bilbo glumly.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
839,"But there seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards  were made over comfortable, perhaps — otherwise we might have had longer warning of the coming of  the dragon, and things might have been different. Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a  while, and can see much without being seen.”   “Not much use, if we have been seen coming here,” said Dori, who was always looking up towards  the Mountain’s peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple. “We must take our chance of that,” said Thorin. “We can go no further to-day.”   “Hear, hear!” cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber  further in, more removed from the cold outside.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
840,"But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were  wheeling and crying unceasingly above. “Something strange is happening,” said Thorin. “The time has gone for the autumn wanderings;  and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off  there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!”   Suddenly Bilbo pointed: “There is that old thrush again!” he cried. “He seems to have escaped,  when Smaug smashed the mountain-side, but I don’t suppose the snails have!”   Sure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and perched on a  stone near by.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
841,"He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, and the top of his head was bald. He was  an aged raven of great size. He alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings,  and bobbed towards Thorin. “O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin,” he croaked (and Bilbo could understand what  he said, for he used ordinary language and not bird-speech). “I am Roac son of Care.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
842,"But go specially to my cousin  Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him  hasten!”   “I will not say if this counsel be good or bad,” croaked Roac, “but I will do what can be done.”  Then off he slowly flew. “Back now to the Mountain!” cried Thorin. “We have little time to lose.”   “And little food to use!” cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. In any case he felt that the  adventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the dragon — in which he was much mistaken  — and he would have given most of his share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these  affairs.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
843,"There was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up  towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of  woodland flowers blossoming in spring. Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth and     feasting by the fires. Some of the younger dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and they muttered  that they wished things had fallen out otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but  Thorin scowled. Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the hoard, and  made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song, and was much like the song  they had sung long before in Bilbo’s little hobbit-hole. Under the Mountain dark and tall  The King has come unto his hall!",POSITIVE,love,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
844,"The king is come unto his hall  Under the Mountain dark and tall. The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,     And ever so our foes shall fall! This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and he began reckoning  the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain,  if he had set out as soon as the message reached him. But Bilbo’s heart fell, both at the song and the  talk: they sounded much too warlike. The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river, and marching up the  valley.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
845,"Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth,  and I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought  for the sorrow and misery of his people. They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have  thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.”   Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin  would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would  remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak spot; and that was just as  well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon  has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
846,"We will bear no weapons against  you, but we leave you to your gold. You may eat that, if you will!”   With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider their case. So  grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the others would not have dared to find fault  with him; but indeed most of them seemed to share his mind — except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili  and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had more than  enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

And cram  is beginning simply to stick in my throat.”     Chapter XVT    A THIEF TN THE NIGHT    Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time piling and ordering the  treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in  every corner. “For the Arkenstone of my father,” he said, “is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and to me  it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone  who finds it and withholds it.”   Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found  — wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
848,"Winter and snow is hastening  behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The  treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!”   But Thorin was not moved. “Winter and snow will bite both men and elves,” he said, “and they  may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon  them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with.”   That night Bilbo made up his mind.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
849,"“I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,” grumbled the fat dwarf. “A sorry business  altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever  a dwarf with a stiff neck.”   “Not as stiff as my legs,” said Bilbo. “I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I would give a good  deal for the feel of grass at my toes.”   “I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after a good  supper!”   “I can’t give you those, while the siege is going on.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

He had about five hours before him. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time,  and ever since the adventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams he  had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would  come out on the wall until it was their turn. It was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made path and climbed down  towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo
851,"How did you get so far past our sentinels?” they asked one after another. “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,” he answered, “companion of Thorin, if you want to know. I know your  king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn’t know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it  is Bard I particularly want to see.”   “Indeed!” said they, “and what may be your business?”   “Whatever it is, it’s my own, my good elves.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

It was as if a globe had been filled with  moonlight and hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars. “This is the Arkenstone of Thrain,” said Bilbo, “the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart  of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon  him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and  withhold the share of the reward. And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his trouble, except  the armour which Thorin had given him already.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in  kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone;  and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly  be blamed for that.”    All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy,  and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey.",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

They buried Thorin deep beneath the  Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast. “There let it lie till the Mountain falls!” he said. “May it bring good fortune to all his folk that  dwell here after!”   Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in  captivity.",POSITIVE,anger,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

To Bilbo he said: “This treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old agreements cannot  stand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence. Yet even though you were willing to lay  aside all your claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove  true: that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all.”   “Very kind of you,” said Bilbo. “But really it is a relief to me.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Thorin,Bilbo

Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo. “We are sent from Dain son of Nain,” they said when questioned. “We are hastening to our  kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed.

There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became  King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls.

Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a distance, and  after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one     to creep towards the light as quietly as they could.

For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They  marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill.

He said he would come inside at least and perhaps  a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Balin,Fili

Bilbo was on the look out,     however, caught the rope, and with a piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing  across the stream. “Help!” he shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the boat before it floated off  down the current. “It was tied after all,” said he, looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili

But  the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they  changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left     alone in complete silence and darkness.

I could eat  anything in the wide world now, for hours on end — but not an apple!”   With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the  company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin  were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless  on the shore. “Well!",NEGATIVE,sadness,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili

In the meanwhile what next?”   “I suggest Lake-town,” said Bilbo. “What else is there?”   Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the  hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were guards at the head of it, but they were not  keeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need.",NEGATIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
917,"Some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if they  expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow right away. The captain of the guard came forward. “And who are these?” he asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo. “The sons of my father’s daughter,” answered Thorin, “Fili and Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West.”   “If you come in peace lay down your arms!” said the captain.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
918,"As for the Master he saw there was  nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to  believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili  beside him in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of  where he came in — no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way — was asked for in the  general bustle. Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of astonishing  enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and  satisfactory fashion.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
919,"On this there had been an old watch-post; but they  dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed. Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on which all  their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy out the land to the South where the  Front   Gate stood. For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They  marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide  loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing swift and  noisily.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
920,"But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back  one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its southern corner. About  midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like  rough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow  track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought  them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain. Booking  down they saw that they were at the top of the cliff at the valley’s head and were gazing down on to  their own camp below.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
921,"Fili and Kili looked  uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering — except old Balin,  the lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps  a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk  with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are  not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much. The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through  the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain.",NEGATIVE,love,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
922,"You may eat that, if you will!”   With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider their case. So  grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the others would not have dared to find fault  with him; but indeed most of them seemed to share his mind — except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili  and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had more than  enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. “The whole place still stinks of dragon,” he grumbled to himself, “and it makes me sick.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili
923,"Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought,  preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end. That did not seem far off. “It will not be long now,” thought Bilbo, “before the goblins win the  Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep,  after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure,  than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all  the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves.",NEGATIVE,anger,hobbit,Bilbo,Kili

Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was  given up to Bard; for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the  Arkenstone in his keeping.”   Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings.

Dwalin and  Balin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said Thorin. They  came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth.

It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I have  always heard,” said Balin anxious to comfort him. “I think you did very well, if you ask me — you  found out one very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is more than most can say  who have had words with the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare  patch in the old Worm’s diamond waistcoat.”   That turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon-slayings historical, dubious,  and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different arts devices and  stratagems by which they had been accomplished.",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Balin,Smaug

Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his head on one side, as if to  listen; and again he sang, and again he listened. “I believe he is trying to tell us something,” said Balin; “but I cannot follow the speech of such  birds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you make it out Baggins?”   “Not very well,” said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at all); “but the old  fellow seems very excited.”   “I only wish he was a raven!” said Balin. “I thought you did not like them!",POSITIVE,joy,hobbit,Balin,Smaug

So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili  beside him in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of  where he came in — no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way — was asked for in the  general bustle.

For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They  marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill.

Fili and Kili looked  uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering — except old Balin,  the lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps  a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Fili,Kili

Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung  with silver they took them and struck them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon,  who had small interest in music) they were still in tune.

So while the others went on with their  work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring back all they could. They were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies of the Lake-men and  the Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain.

This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also  this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words  of a year ago — it seemed to him more like ten — so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where  the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert  and Bill.

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at  the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was  all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure.

The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the  firelight flickered — it was April — and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf’s beard  wagged against the wall.

Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in May-  sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: “There’s a light over there!” There  was a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they  could now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches  twinkling.

But his poor little feet had been very  squashed in Bert’s big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and his head was going round; so there  he lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight.

The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his  mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud  clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble.

At last twelve dwarves were stowed.

For this purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They  marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide  loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing swift and  noisily.",POSITIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Balin

He said he would come inside at least and perhaps  a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary. The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for  his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little  fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got  into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any  particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk  with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are  not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much.

After a while Balin bade Bilbo “Good luck!” and stopped where he could still see the faint outline  of the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the  others just outside.

It was midnight and clouds had covered the  stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again,  and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the  back and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service.

Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his head on one side, as if to  listen; and again he sang, and again he listened. “I believe he is trying to tell us something,” said Balin; “but I cannot follow the speech of such  birds, it is very quick and difficult.",NEGATIVE,fear,hobbit,Bilbo,Balin

Really it is enough to make one weep,  after all one has gone through.

They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this  rate.” And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to  Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the  mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond.

'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.'      `Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams I saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Balin

'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. `But we will not here speak of it more openly.

Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could. `And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?

You shall not be the only guest without a gift.'      `There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,' said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. `Nothing, unless it might be – unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Galadriel,Gimli

'Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas! ' said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of _lembas_. 'That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!'

Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden.

Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to the others. `The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.'      With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Legolas,Boromir

An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last they saw Legolas coming back.

When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Legolas,Boromir

'I am all right,' gasped Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Legolas,Boromir

Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's.

He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf. Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Merry

Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Merry

'An evil of the Ancient World it seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. `It was both a shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.'      'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.'      `Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams I saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Gimli

Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.

He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.'      `Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Boromir,Elrond

'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; `but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while.'      'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. `The time has come.

Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me also,' he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: `The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less.

As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East.

But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Sam, both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself. Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Sam

Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Sam

The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold. After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1528,"The air came fresh from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed. They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-brow under which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1529,"Make haste while the Sun shines!' And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry meeting!'      But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1530,"In the dark there was a snarling noise. Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: _Ho!",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1531,"Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,            By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice singing:            Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,            Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1532,"None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:            His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low door-like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo's feet; and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the sickly hue had left them.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1533,"At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that silence. 'Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean grass! You must help me bear them.'      Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1534,"You must help me bear them.'      Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1535,"Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open! To Frodo's great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets. 'What in the name of wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his face, and he closed his eyes.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1536,"Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!'      He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:            Hey! now!",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1537,"See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!'      Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter. 'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?' asked Frodo. 'He's mine,' said Tom. 'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him.",POSITIVE,love,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1538,"Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view. Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight. They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1539,"'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.'      'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it's homelike enough inside.'      Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor windows were level with the ground.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Tom,Frodo
1540,"He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire. There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry
1541,"When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done together, they toasted Bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom. Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come. The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger).",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry
1543,And all those close talks with Gandalf.'      'Good heavens!' said Frodo. 'I thought I had been both careful and clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my departure then?'      'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that!,POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry
1544,"He must have taken it away.'      'Well, as I was saying,' Merry proceeded, 'I kept my knowledge to myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.'      'Where is he?' said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. 'Step forward, Sam!' said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'      'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,' answered Merry. 'They _could_ have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry
1546,"It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways – then he slipped the Ring on. Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry
1547,"He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do. But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned. 'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry      'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.'      'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.'      'Perhaps,' said Strider.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

A feast!' said Merry. `As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.' He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts.

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Merry

But the chief importance of Findegil's copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbo's 'Translations from the Elvish'. These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written.

Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Círdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo

He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. `Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.'      Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo
1637,"`It recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.'      `You remember?' said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. `But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.'      'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely. `But my memory reaches back even to the Elder Days. Eärendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of Lúthien of Doriath.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo
1638,"`Here is the Sword that was Broken!' he said. `And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?' asked Boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his weather-stained cloak. `He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; `and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil. He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.'      `Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once. 'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; `but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while.'      'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo

Standing suddenly up he burst out:            All that is gold does not glitter,             Not all those who wander are lost;            The old that is strong does not wither,             Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear, you had best listen to it.'

To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.

What is his counsel-if he knows the things that we have heard?'      `The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. `I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'      `Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo

Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. `If I understand aright all that I have heard,' he said, `I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will.

I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?'

Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo

Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Elrond,Frodo

Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or _flet_ as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a _talan_.

But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.

But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told. The process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit,_ in which there were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring. Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of _The Lord of the Rings_ went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Durin,Gandalf

Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinúviel.

Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Pipin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Merry, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight.

'An evil of the Ancient World it seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. `It was both a shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.'

Let's get hold of Nob!'       In the end there was more than three hours' delay. Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell.

In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam.

This would mean crossing the Road, but.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bill,Frodo

They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bill,Frodo

Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb. `Bill, my lad,' he said, `you oughtn't to have took up with us. You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.' Bill swished his tail and said nothing. Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bill,Frodo

Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.

Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet. As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake.

Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness.

He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.'      `Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.

And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.'

Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andúril, Flame of the West. Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond.

The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell. Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard.

1959,"'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,' he said, looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, he thought. After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Lobelia,Frodo
1960,"He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland 'to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.

As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded the hoard was destroyed.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Sam, both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself. Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

He used the ring many times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was writing.

The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

'If you mean, inventing all that about a  present , well, I thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn't see the point of altering it at all.

There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf. 'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,' they said.

Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire. There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.

Everything looked fresh, and the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees' fingers. Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.

The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence. The dining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was good wine: Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.

Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come. The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage.

2017,"'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam. They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. 'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him. 'It may not matter much,' he said apologetically, 'but I would rather not be seen on the road – by anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered. 'But perhaps it would only have made matters worse.'

You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?'

'Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keep you from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time.

But it is said: _Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger._ The choice is yours: to go or wait.'      'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go _not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.'_      'Is it indeed?' laughed Gildor.

If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'

Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.'

'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'      'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,' answered Merry. 'They _could_ have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge.

'I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'      Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge.

It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo. Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders. 'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways – then he slipped the Ring on.

There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him.

He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield.

2069,"The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.'      `Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin. `He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2070,"`As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.' He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf. Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2071,"'I wonder greatly what brings _four_ hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'      'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo politely. He guessed that even in Elrond's house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time. 'But I am equally curious,' he added, `to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.'      Glóin looked at him.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2072,"The doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. `This is the Hall of Fire' said the wizard. `Here you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep awake.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2073,"'And Gandalf said:  The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again. Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.' He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good to see you again!",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. `That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf. `Come along now! Both you and Bilbo are wanted.'

2076,"On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. `Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.'      Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2077,"`He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; `and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil. He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.'      `Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once. 'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; `but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while.'      'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. `The time has come. Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.'      There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2078,"There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!'      `Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But the story still does not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.'      Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me also,' he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: `The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not hear the proofs?",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2079,"What is his counsel-if he knows the things that we have heard?'      `The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. `I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'      `Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then?",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2080,"But in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away.'      `I saw you!' cried Frodo. `You were walking backwards and forwards. The moon shone in your hair.'      Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'It was only a dream' said Frodo, `but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgotten it.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think.

Do not count on anything yet.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

I must be off.'      `How long do you think I shall have here?' said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone. `Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2085,"`We don't want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.'      `That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead,' said Elrond. `Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin.

2086,"Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andúril, Flame of the West. Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain. All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they had brought from Bree.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

So Bill was going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that did not seem depressed. Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2089,"The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell. Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2090,"Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red. Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand. `We have done well,' he said. `We have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its name.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think of your course now, Aragorn?'      Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened anxiously.

In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate would go.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo
2094,"He was relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. `From signs that we have seen lately,' said Gandalf, 'I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we can.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Gandalf,Frodo

With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow. 'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. `I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky turn.

He almost called aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand there was a white staff.

His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor.

It was flung across the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge.

The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends.

To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows. `For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to Sam, `I have only a small gift.' She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Legolas,Merry

Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Legolas,Merry

Of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light.

Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him when they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.

The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere 'question' and not a 'riddle' according to the strict rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his promise.

At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage.

Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit.

The idea of a 'present' was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his 'birthday present', many times. That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book.

His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket.

At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G  and the elf-rune, . That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights.

Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.

But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue.

The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.

A gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo.

Except on the high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 1311, when the white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine. Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was already ankle-deep about his boots.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Gandalf

I don't think much of your diary_, he said. _Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!_      _But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo_, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness.

'You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf. `There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.' Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said. They now went on again.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Gandalf
2235,"Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman? The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Gandalf

All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words. Time went on, and still he was no nearer to a choice. Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Gandalf

These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. Since Merry and Pipin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo as he shut the door on her. 'It was a compliment,' said Merry Brandybuck, 'and so, of course, not true.'       Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding – unless the search is interrupted. When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. It's time to close the shop, Merry,' he said.

Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Pipin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Merry, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good 'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens.",POSITIVE,love,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

He began to say to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.'      So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders.

Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire. There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry
2244,"But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the Bag End'. But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland. 'Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,' he said. 'Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.'      As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upside-down.

Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come. The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage.

Ring the bell, if you lack anything!'      So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company.

He began to suspect even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs. _Chapter 10_             Strider       Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light.

While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned. 'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

They might as well set out for the Moon.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Frodo,Merry

But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes.

After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and rocky.

'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry      'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.'      'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.'

The light was no longer bright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.

'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo, for it concerns us closely.' Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the fire.

I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.'

Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast.

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined.

The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends.

Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.

There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.

If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself.

Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father's house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Lúthien,Frodo

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.'      `Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.

Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?'      `I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a riddle,' answered Boromir proudly. `Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.'

I almost wish that my adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.'

Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.

As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a shining light.

Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinúviel.

Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo's father.

Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.

Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast.

When they asked: 'Where is he then?' he shrugged his shoulders.

Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good 'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens.

He began to say to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.'      So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo.

2560,"And the poor old troll!' With that he fell fast asleep. Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all'. Merely to be there was a cure for weariness, fear, and sadness. As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo

'Am I right in guessing that you are _the_ Glóin, one of the twelve companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield?'      `Quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. 'And I do not ask, for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.'      `Thank you very much,' said Frodo.

But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'      'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo politely.

'I will come and see them, if ever I can,' said Frodo. 'How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!'      Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you not?' he asked. `Yes,' answered Frodo.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo

2565,"Where is he?'      Elrond laughed. `He shall be found,' he said. `Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them.

I should very much like just to peep at it again.'      `Yes, I've got it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. `It looks just the same as ever it did.'      `Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo. When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo

To his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him. The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo
2568,"Tell me all about the Shire!'       Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory. The light and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton.

2574,"Come and go as you like, as long as you don't make a noise.'       They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire.

He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. `It is a song to Elbereth,' said Bilbo. `They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!'      He led Frodo back to his own little room.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo

He looked again at Aragorn, and doubt was in his eyes. Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed on his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out:            All that is gold does not glitter,             Not all those who wander are lost;            The old that is strong does not wither,             Deep roots are not reached by the frost.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo

Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered, and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was examined. At last he sat down again.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Bilbo,Frodo
2582,"But such falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him.

A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice. `I will take the Ring,' he said, `though I do not know the way.'

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen.

Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father's house.

2668,"He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath. At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to Aragorn.

While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo.

Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him. At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see_.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'      'Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn:      Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of Balin and his book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow bridge, and the coming of the Terror. 'An evil of the Ancient World it seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. `It was both a shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.'      'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.'      `Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams I saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind. His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.'      The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed.

The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady's gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one. As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more. That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.'

Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in.

It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless.

And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now and talk for a while, since I have found you?",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo
2695,"The others remained long by the river-side. For some time they had been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do?",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Aragorn,Frodo

I would choose Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.'      `And I too will go with him,' said Legolas. `It would be faithless now to say farewell.'      'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said Aragorn. 'But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all should.

As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem credible.

'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.

It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white.

Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter.

So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company.

But long ago he rode away,            and where he dwelleth none can say;            for into darkness fell his star            in Mordor where the shadows are.

2788,"'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo. 'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.'      Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. 'Run down with this to your home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2789,"'Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes prying.' Sam ran off at full speed. 'Well, now we're off at last!' said Frodo. They shouldered their packs and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of Bag End.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2790,"At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf. 'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2791,"'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo. 'I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.'      'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam stoutly and untruthfully. 'No, you don't, Sam!' said Pippin. 'It is good for him.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2792,"'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got the bath-water hot?'      Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'No, sir, I haven't, sir!' he said. Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2793,"Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?'      'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2794,"They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods. 'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam. They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. 'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2795,"He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right. 'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour. 'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or _smelling_ for me; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I've never seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.'      'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?' said Pippin.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'Begging your pardon,' put in Sam suddenly, 'I know where he comes from. It's from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there's more than one. And I know where he's going to.'      'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2797,"And I know where he's going to.'      'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. 'Why didn't you speak up before?'      'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: _Hello, Sam!_ he says. _I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2798,"I wish I had, or you had told me about it before. I might have been more careful on the road.'      'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer's stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don't see how he could have followed us.'      'What about the _smelling,_ sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a black chap.'      'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered. 'But perhaps it would only have made matters worse.'      'Then you know or guess something about this rider?' said Pippin, who had caught the muttered words.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2799,"'I don't want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another Black Rider.'      'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!'      The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2800,"It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again. 'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not pulled him back. 'Yes, it is Elves,' said Frodo.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2801,"I am thankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he heard the voices he slipped away.'      'What about the Elves?' said Sam, too excited to trouble about the rider. 'Can't we go and see them?'      'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2802,"It is not our custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.'      'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said Pippin. Sam was speechless. 'I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing. _'Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo,_ a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he added in the high-elven speech.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2803,"It is some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your journey tomorrow.'      They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside from the path.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2804,"Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: 'Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.'      Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2805,"Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel among hobbits!'      After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2806,"'But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?'      'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring gently. 'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor. 'The Enemy?' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2807,"'Come and have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.'      Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for today?' asked Pippin. 'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2808,"Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!'      'They are,' said Frodo. 'Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?'      'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite different from what I expected – so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.'      Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2809,"They are quite different from what I expected – so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.'      Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful. 'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now – now that your wish to see them has come true already?' he asked. 'Yes, sir.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 'Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' said Pippin.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2811,"They halted, wondering what to do. 'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly. Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. 'Look!' he said, clutching Frodo by the arm.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2812,"The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them. Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:            Ho! Ho! Ho!",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2813,"Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'      Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2814,"Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!' To the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'Mr.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.'      Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2817,"The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow _clop_ of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we'll send this rider to the rightabouts!' He climbed out and went to the farmer's side. Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:      'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?'      On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.

And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'Wait for me, Sam,' he stammered. 'Must bathe feet a minute.'      Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:      'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns and he says take care; and I _say yes_ to that, and let's begin with him.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2850,"He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it.'      Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. 'No,' he said slowly.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2851,"I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-room:  thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I shall roast him._                   _Fare Well!_        Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. 'Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!' he said. 'He deserves roasting.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2852,"We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you prepared to carry on your backs?'      'As much as we must,' said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt). 'I can carry enough for two,' said Sam defiantly. 'Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?' asked Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2853,"Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2854,"There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, _neek-breek, breek-neek,_ unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic. The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued them. As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2855,"Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than they are.'      The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. 'You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!' he said. 'What do you advise us to do?' asked Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2856,"If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him. On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides. There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The other three went on. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2857,"Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light. Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2858,"All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell. 'I don't know what it is,' he said, 'but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn't go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was creeping up the slope.'      'Did you _see_ anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2859,"Then the shapes slowly advanced. Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2860,"Where is the pale king?' he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He heard Frodo's voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2861,"Strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago. Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side. 'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,' he said gently, 'nor in league with them.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2862,"Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. 'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him. 'I think I understand things better now,' he said in a low voice. 'There seem only to have been five of the enemy.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2863,"In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.'      As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life. They started off in a southerly direction.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2864,"Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?'      'We shall see,' answered Strider. 'There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.'      'What is the matter with my master?' asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider. 'His wound was small, and it is already closed. There's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.'      'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,' said Strider, 'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2865,"But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.'      The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both looked terrified.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2866,"We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very large!'      'We will come and look at them,' said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared. The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light. They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2867,"Troll's old seat is still the same,            And the bone he boned from its owner! 'Well, that's a warning to us all!' laughed Merry. 'It is as well you used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!'      'Where did you come by that, Sam?' asked Pippin. 'I've never heard those words before.'      Sam muttered something inaudible. 'It's out of his own head, of course,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2868,"Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm. 'My master is sick and wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He can't go on riding after nightfall. He needs rest.'      Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2869,"There was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream. They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep immediately.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2870,"He was fully awake now, and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous `short cut' through the Old Forest the `accident' at _The Prancing Pony_; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window. 'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?'      'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf. `Sam was here until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.'      `What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2871,"For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.'      'Yes,' said Frodo, `it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at first. Sam never quite trusted him.

2872,"`Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!'      He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune. At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'Let's go and look for the rest of the party!'      `I can take you to them, sir,' said Sam. `It's a big house this, and very peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you'll find round a corner.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

Come on, guide me round the corners!'      Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2876,"It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour.

He could see no sign of Strider.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2877,"`He shall be found,' he said. `Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of himself.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2878,"The light and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion. `It's most unfair,' said Pippin. `Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!'      `Rewards!' said Frodo.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not surprised.'      `Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam.

But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.'

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water.

While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo.

2912,"Dusk veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood.

Deep night had fallen.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.'       Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or _flet_ as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a _talan_. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

They stood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again, and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo

And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my meaning.'      Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2916,"It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lórien and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. When evening in the Shire was grey            his footsteps on the Hill were heard;            before the dawn he went away            on journey long without a word.

But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, but what it was he did not know.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring,Sam,Frodo
2926,"Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate ended.

The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends.

Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined. He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him.

'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name.

War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory.

'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.'      Treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings.

But there were some others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that Southerner at Bree: only he was not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'      'I thought of him too,' said Aragorn.

Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3137,"Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads. There was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air moving in the grass. 'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. 'Many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us!'      'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. Yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3138,"The riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said Legolas. 'Five leagues or one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'      'We will wait,' said Aragorn. 'I am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the orc-trail.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3139,"We may get new s from them.'      'Or spears,' said Gimli. 'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,' said Legolas. 'I did not say that we should hear good news,' said Aragorn. 'But evil or good we will await it here.'      The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. A little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3140,"The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy. 'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit here waiting for sudden death?'      'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

At least they will not love the Orcs.'      'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor ' said Gimli. 'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' answered Aragorn. 'You will soon learn the truth,' said Legolas. 'Already they approach.'      At length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3142,"Choose swiftly!'      Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown. Éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli
3143,"There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and I would gladly learn better.'      'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'      'Hope does not remain,' said Éomer.

There was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when Éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only Éothain dared to speak openly.

'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn. 'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'

Aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of Hasufel. Before long they came to the borders of the Entwash, and there they met the other trail of which Éomer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold. Aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and taking care not to override the footprints.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.

Also we are on the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'

He went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance. When the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

Gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign.

But nothing happened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

'Maybe,' said the Elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'      'That would not baffle a Ranger,' said Gimli. 'A bent blade is enough for Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

'There are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Gimli

Then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it.

There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon.

Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. 'Two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is certainly Sam's: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: Frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Sam

'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely 'He has been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over the management of Isengard.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gandalf,Merry

'That is not surprising,' answered Merry; 'for it is an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold Hornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our reckoning. How old Toby came by the plant...'      'You do not know your danger, Théoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue patience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gandalf,Merry

Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain-side. Far away came a _hoom-hom_, as of horns blowing triumphantly. 'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf. 'There is the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and some others are watching it.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gandalf,Merry

'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his sides, and he stands as still as a door-tree.'      'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'

'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said Aragorn.

Across the waste they saw riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to Orthanc. 'There is Gandalf, and Théoden and his men!' said Legolas. 'Let us go and meet them!'      'Walk warily!' said Merry. 'There are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.'

'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though they came to the balance of a hair.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gandalf,Merry

He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he was now going.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo

After so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates.

But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of – well, Gandalf, of wizards. 'Maybe,' said Faramir. `Maybe you discern from far away the air of Númenor.

For a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away. `There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir. 'Is it morning already? ' said Frodo yawning.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3473,"It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3474,"Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! What's going on? '      Faramir heard and answered. `Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3475,"Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks. until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level reaches.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3476,"The moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise stone. Faramir turned to the man at his side. `Now what would you say that it is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3477,"I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, nigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your command to shoot, Captain.'      `Shall we shoot? ' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo. Frodo did not answer for a moment. Then `No!",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3478,"Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annûn may cost him all he has to give.'      `Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. `Shall I not shoot, Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.'      `Wait, Anborn,' said Faramir. `This is a harder matter than it seems. What have you to say now, Frodo?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3479,"But this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and took us, he was my guide.'      `Your guide! ' said Faramir. `The matter becomes ever stranger. I would do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by Orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3480,"`You may keep your bows bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.'      `Go then and be swift!

Lead Frodo down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3481,"We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like trickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3482,"The fish of this pool are dearly bought.'      Gollum dropped the fish from his hand. `Don't want fish,' he said. 'The price is not set on the fish,' said Faramir. `Only to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at the prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3483,"Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes, nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise they are; so just, so very just.'      'Not very wise,' said Faramir. 'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo

3485,"You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.'

'      'But, Lord Faramir,' said Frodo bowing, `you have not yet declared your will concerning the said Frodo, and until that is made known, he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postponed until the morning; but that is now at hand.'      `Then I will declare my doom,' said Faramir. `As for you, Frodo, in so far as lies in me under higher authority, I declare you free in the realm of, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3487,"Are you answered? '      Frodo bowed low. 'I am answered,' he said, `and I place myself at your service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.'      `It is of great worth,' said Faramir. 'And now, do you take this creature, this Sméagol, under your protection? '      `I do take Sméagol under my protection,' said Frodo.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3488,"Sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows. 'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do not well serve him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3489,"' Still Gollum did not answer. `I will answer for him,' said Frodo. `He brought me to the Black Gate, as I asked; but it was impassable.'      `There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,' said Faramir. `Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the Southward road ' Frodo continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas Ithil.'      `Minas Morgul,' said Faramir. `I do not know clearly,' said Frodo; `but the path climbs, I think, up into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city stands.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo

It goes up to a high cleft and so down to – that which is beyond.'      `Do you know the name of that high pass? ' said Faramir. 'No,' said Frodo. 'It is called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3491,"'      Anborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was drawn across the recess. `Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir. `I do not think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.'      'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3492,"And I do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.'      'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find. And there is no time for long searching,' said Frodo. `It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,' said Faramir. 'But at the least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Sméagol. He has done murder before now.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3493,"_Chapter 7_             Journey to the Cross-roads       Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. When they had finished they stood up.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3494,"Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'       Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Sam I release from this, if you wish.'      Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annûn. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3495,"Then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. They marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where Faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3496,"'      Frodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. Twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. The sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3497,"So great an army had never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur's might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth.

'The storm has burst at last,' he thought. `This great array of spears and swords is going to Osgiliath.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3498,"'      Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo
3499,"Such drink is not for us.'      `Then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said Sam. `But there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.'      'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. `We are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'      'I wouldn't trust it,' said Sam, 'not till I was dying of thirst. There's a wicked feeling about this place.' He sniffed.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo

3501,"`Go on? Is that what I've got to do? And leave him?'      Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given at the other. 'If I'm to go on,' he said, `then I must take your sword, by your leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Frodo

Yet I am named Éomer son of Éomund, and am called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.'      'Then Éomer son of Éomund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the Dwarf Glóin's son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can excuse you.'

He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown. Éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Éomer,Gimli
3504,"Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'      'There were no dwarves nor children,' said Éomer.

'Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?' said Gimli. 'We do not and we never have.' said Éomer with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Éomer,Gimli
3506,"There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood.

'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'      'Hope does not remain,' said Éomer.

We found a clear token not far from the East Wall that one at least of them was still alive there.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Éomer,Gimli
3507,"In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of your good faith. Do not fail.'      'I will not,' said Aragorn. There was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when Éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only Éothain dared to speak openly. 'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a Dwarf?'      'No one,' said Gimli.

'Then it is true, as Éomer reported, that you are in league with the Sorceress of the Golden Wood?' said Wormtongue. 'It is not to be wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.'      Gimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.

'So be it!' said Éomer. 'But until that time pardon me, and in token of pardon ride with me, I beg.

There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon.

Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine.

'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 'But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.'

For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like _boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom_, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Treebeard,Merry
3530,"A great _hoom, hom_ rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came from several directions a similar _hoom, hom, hoom_ that was not an echo but an answer. Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds. Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Treebeard,Merry
3531,"They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like Treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were as different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in. At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine).",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Treebeard,Merry
3532,"now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. Treebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the Ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth.

'And was it Saruman that ordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?'      'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely 'He has been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over the management of Isengard.

Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. Where is Treebeard, Merry?'      'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink-of clean water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work – over there.'

'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'      'He left a message,' said Merry, 'and I was coming to it, but I have been hindered by many other questions.

We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that I should like to know the truth of.'      'And there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you ' said Merry. 'We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old Ent, but that is not nearly enough.'      'All in good time,' said Legolas.

3587,"licking his colourless lips. `No, we have got no fish,' said Frodo. `We have only got this' – he held up a wafer of _lembas_ – 'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.'      `Yess, yess, nice water,' said Gollum. `Drink it, drink it, while we can! But what is it they've got, precious?",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3588,"Is it tasty? '      Frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. `Sméagol smells it! ' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3589,"Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little. 'Look here! ' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether Gollum heard him or not. `We've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Sméagol or Gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3590,"Give me about two hours, not more, and then call me.'      So tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he lay still as stone.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3591,"Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3592,"`Be back soon.'      'Come back now!' shouted Sam. 'Hi! Come back!' But Gollum had vanished. Frodo woke at the sound of Sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 'Hullo!' he said.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3593,"But he'll come back, you'll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won't leave his Precious, anyway.'      Frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside them. `Don't think of any of your Gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'You were worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3594,"' asked Frodo. 'Must we cross these evil-smelling fens? '      `No need, no need at all,' said Gollum. 'Not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a little' – his skinny arm waved north and east – `and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gates of His country.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3595,"Follow Sméagol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.'       It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

Elves and Men and Orcs.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3598,"The night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3599,"The naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight. Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands. `Wraiths!' he wailed.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3600,"Ach, _gollum_, _gollum_, _gollum_! ' It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol Brandir, that he would get up or make a move. From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3601,"Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind. In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3602,"Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow. Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3603,"Too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3604,"It was evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him.

3605,"We wants it! We wants it! '      Each time that the second thought spoke, Gollum's long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as Sméagol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck. Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3606,"Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight.

3607,"It's no use, no use! '      Pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them like a beaten dog. So they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

3611,"To all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible – at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'. Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. `And it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what master means to do,' he thought.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

Frodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of Cirith Gorgor.

As if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell.

Indeed it seems that I must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but _nice master_.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

Frodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. `Come now, Gollum or Sméagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.'      But Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little Sméagol'.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

On the right a road went down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on southwards. `On, on, on,' said Gollum. `We never went that way, but they say it goes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is never still.

They built very tall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a stone like the Moon, and round it were great white walls.

3621,"But not for the Black One. The Precious was ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.'      Frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning.

Frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'.

3652,"Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. `Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. `Is that the opening of-of the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?'      `Need we think about it yet?' said Sam, `Surely we're not going to move any more today, if day it is?'      `Perhaps not, perhaps not,' said Gollum. `But we must go soon, to the Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3653,"That's the way over there yes, Master.'       The red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3654,"`It's been going on for a good while now. Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.'      Sam looked round. `Where's Gollum? ' he said. 'Hasn't he come back yet?'      `No,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3655,"Wake up. Master, wake u He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself loose and backed away. 'They mustn't be silly,' he hissed. `We must go.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3656,"Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering darkness. Very stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. For about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the hills.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3657,"And then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell. _Chapter 8_             The Stairs of Cirith Ungol       Gollum was tugging at Frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and impatience. `We must go,' he said. `We mustn't stand here.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3658,"Frodo's head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-roads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank. A long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the mountains.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3659,"Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. `Not that way!",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3660,"`Not that way! No, not that way! ' whispered Gollum, but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror. `Hold up, Mr. Frodo!",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3661,"'Come back! Not that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.'      Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3662,"Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley. Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3663,"Just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'       Dizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. 'There's another stair still,' he said. `Much longer stair.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3664,"If once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under Cirith Ungol. In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo and Sam a little way within. and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the Elves.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3665,"I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you without your Sam knowing it.'      `Sleep!' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.'      `Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.'       And so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3666,"In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace was in both their faces.

3667,"For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum – `pawing at master,' as he thought. `Hey you!' he said roughly. `What are you up to?'      'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

3669,"Found any food? Have you had any rest? '      `No food, no rest, nothing for Sméagol,' said Gollum. `He's a sneak.'      Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. 'Don't take names to yourself, Sméagol,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo
3670,"`He's really gone this time, I fancy,' muttered Sam. `I guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you again, you'll be sorry for it.'      Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage. 'This can't be the way,' Frodo whispered.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

3672,"Before Sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel. Sword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

So far Gollum's plot had succeeded. _Chapter 10_             The Choices of Master Sam       Frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his body away.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Frodo

3675,"Sam looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Elrond,Frodo

On that errand I came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.'

The hobbits bowed low. `Most gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'       Now they made ready to depart.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Elrond,Frodo

Sam scratched his head. `No, I can't think how, begging your pardon,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gaffer,Sam

Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against.

Treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings. The hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council. But they were clear at any rate that Uglúk and his troop came from Isengard, and spoke of Saruman as their master.

He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he was now going.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Boromir

He had hardly saved the Ring from the proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both sterner and wiser.

Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of Ithilien. Sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Boromir

Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. `It must have irked Boromir to run from Orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the Balrog – even though he was the last to leave.'      `He was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us. He alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Boromir

And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of Minas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell silent for a while. `You don't say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,' said Sam, suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Boromir

For the king was to ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled.

Do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward, when the immediate peril was westward? He persuaded you to forbid Éomer to pursue the raiding Orcs. If Éomer had not defied Wormtongue's voice speaking with your mouth, those Orcs would have reached Isengard by now, bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which Saruman desires above all else, but at the least two members of my Company, sharers of a secret hope, of which even to you, lord, I cannot yet speak openly.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Éomer,Saruman

And Sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'      'Our choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow Frodo, or else to follow the Orcs on foot. There is little hope either way.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Legolas,Sam

It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.

With that he plunged into an account of Boromir's last fight and the orc-march from Emyn Muil to the Forest. The others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses. 'Here are some treasures that you let fall,' said Aragorn. 'You will be glad to have them back.' He loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives.

He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of Grishnákh's hairy arms. 'All this about the Orcs of Barad-dûr, Lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said Aragorn.

'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said Aragorn.

And the memory of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of Ithilien.

'That we do also,' said Faramir. After so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates.

Faramir sighed and fell silent for a while. `You don't say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,' said Sam, suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3767,"Warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that's a lot o' nonsense, and all wide of my mark.'      'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. `Perilously fair.'      `I don't know about _perilous_,' said Sam. `It strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into Lórien, and finds it there because they've brought it.",POSITIVE,love,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3768,"And here in the wild I have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality! Ha!' He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting. Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3769,"Another bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: `Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said. `You took the chance, sir.'      `Did I so?' said Faramir. `Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'      Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Sam.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3770,"I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.'      `Ah well, sir,' said Sam, `you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of – well, Gandalf, of wizards. 'Maybe,' said Faramir. `Maybe you discern from far away the air of Númenor. Good night!'                              _Chapter 6_             The Forbidden Pool       Frodo woke to find Faramir bending over him.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3771,"It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3772,"Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks. until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level reaches.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3773,"I hope it will be all right; but I hate the whole business.'      `So do I,' said Sam. `And nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is.'      A man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. `Bring wine for the guests,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3774,"Sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows. 'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do not well serve him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam

After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. When they had finished they stood up.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3776,"Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'       Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Sam I release from this, if you wish.'      Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annûn. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3777,"'      Frodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. Twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. The sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3778,"Such drink is not for us.'      `Then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said Sam. `But there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.'      'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. `We are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'      'I wouldn't trust it,' said Sam, 'not till I was dying of thirst. There's a wicked feeling about this place.' He sniffed.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam

3780,"Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir's staff. Desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Faramir,Sam
3781,"Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer? How shall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?'      He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3782,"All that I have done today has gone amiss. What is to be done now?'      'First we must tend the fallen,' said Legolas. 'We cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.'      'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We must follow the Orcs, if there is hope that any of our Company are living prisoners.'      'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not ' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3783,"An evil choice is now before us!'      'Then let us do first what we must do,' said Legolas. 'We have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A cairn we might build.'      'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-side,' said Gimli. 'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give him to Anduin.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3784,"Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal. 'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What do they mean?'      'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.'      'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'      'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3785,"It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for Boromir was a man both tall and strong. At the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier. while Legolas and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. It was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore. 'There is a strange tale to tell!' said Legolas.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3786,"The last words of Boromir he long kept secret. 'Well, so much at least is now clear,' said Legolas: 'Frodo is no longer on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. And Sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'      'Our choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow Frodo, or else to follow the Orcs on foot. There is little hope either way. We have already lost precious hours.'      'Let me think!' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3787,"'No other folk make such a trampling,' said Legolas. 'It seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'      'But they go with a great speed for all that,' said Aragorn, 'and they do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'      'Well, after them!' said Gimli. 'Dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'      'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3788,"They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood. 'Here is another riddle!' said Gimli. 'But it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait.'      'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said Legolas. 'Enemies of the Orcs are likely to be our friends.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3789,"I can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'      'Many things,' said Legolas. 'It is a great company on foot; but I cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many leagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'      'I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,' said Gimli. 'Let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'      'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs chose,' said Aragorn. They followed their enemies now by the clear light of day.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3790,"He held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain. 'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried Legolas and Gimli together. 'Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall,' said Aragorn. 'This did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3791,"'We have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'Shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'      'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.' said Legolas. 'Surely even Orcs must pause on the march?' said Gimli. 'Seldom will Orcs journey in the open under the sun. yet these have done so,' said Legolas.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3792,"'Certainly they will not rest by night.'      'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said Gimli. 'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said Legolas. 'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said Aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'      'And there is this also,' said Gimli: 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'      'That is true,' said Aragorn. 'But if I read the signs back yonder rightly, the Orcs of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for Isengard.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3793,"In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'      'The Orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,' said Legolas. 'There will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. How that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'      'And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause ' said Gimli. 'My heart burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a little to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'      'I said that it was a hard choice,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3794,"So let us use the time as best we may!'      He cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. Gimli was still deep in slumber, but Legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night. 'They are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. 'I know in my heart that they have not rested this night.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3795,"'Come! We must go,' he said. 'The scent is growing cold.'      'But it is still dark,' said Gimli. 'Even Legolas on a hill-top could not see them till the Sun is up.'      'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,' said Legolas. 'Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3796,"'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said Legolas. 'The Orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of Sauron were behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'      Gimli ground his teeth. 'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said. 'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3797,"'They rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of Fangorn.'      'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'      'It is still far away,' said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3798,"Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown. Rede oft is found at the rising of the Sun.'      'Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' said Gimli. The night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3799,"But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads. There was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air moving in the grass. 'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. 'Many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us!'      'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred and five.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3800,"'Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said Legolas. 'Five leagues or one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land.

3802,"They have long been the friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of the North, and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the Beornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Orcs.'      'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor ' said Gimli. 'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' answered Aragorn. 'You will soon learn the truth,' said Legolas.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas

3804,"Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!'      Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3805,"There are spare horses as you see. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and I would gladly learn better.'      'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'      'Hope does not remain,' said Éomer. 'You will not find your friends on the North-borders.'      'Yet my friends are not behind.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3806,"'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudged.'      'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn. 'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'      A great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted it. 'Hasufel is his name,' said Éomer.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3807,"But Legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'I need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder Arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. Gimli was lifted up behind his friend. and he clung to him, not much more at ease than Sam Gamgee in a boat. 'Farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried Éomer.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3808,"It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell. Elrond was against their coming.'      'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas. 'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered Gimli. 'His foresight failed him.'

'There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3809,"But our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! Cut no living wood!'      'There is no need,' said Gimli. 'The Riders have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' He went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance. When the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas

Legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The tree rustled. There was no other sound.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas

Suddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3812,"'Well, they are gone,' said Aragorn at last. 'We cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.'      'Feet!' said Gimli. 'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.

Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed Legolas, and their watches wore away.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3814,"Day had come at last. At dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits. 'And do not forget that old man!' said Gimli. 'I should be happier if I could see the print of a boot.'      'Why would that make you happy?' said Legolas. 'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the Dwarf.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3815,"His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even now, maybe.'      'It is likely enough,' said Aragorn; 'yet I am not sure. I am thinking of the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. But I did not think so. Did you hear them, Legolas?",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3816,"That at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'      'There was sorcery here right enough,' said Gimli. 'What was that old man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas
3817,"The earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much. 'One hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said Aragorn.

'I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said Legolas.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas

Legolas and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gimli,Legolas

In other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace.

Gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All weariness seemed to have left him.

You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of Glóin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless.

Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the Mountain in the North.

This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led also up on to the wall from the Deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.

They gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to hand, and under Gimli's direction the Westfold-men blocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained.

'These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,' he said; 'and I have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age.

Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. `It must have irked Boromir to run from Orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the Balrog – even though he was the last to leave.'      `He was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us.

After a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor, and they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived in Ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. From such men the Lord Denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, they would not say) to harry the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between the Ephel Dúath and the River. `It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,' said Mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Mablung,Frodo

They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir with Frodo and Sam behind.

By root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm.

'So be it!' said Éomer. 'But until that time pardon me, and in token of pardon ride with me, I beg.

He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose.

He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely. And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here lie many that are not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are others strange to me.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Legolas

'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.' What he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.

For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished. 'Which way would they turn, do you think?' said Legolas.

'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said Legolas. 'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said Aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'      'And there is this also,' said Gimli: 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'      'That is true,' said Aragorn.

'My heart burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a little to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'      'I said that it was a hard choice,' said Aragorn. 'How shall we end this debate?'      'You are our guide,' said Gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. You shall choose.'

Gimli was still deep in slumber, but Legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.

4013,"Just to the West of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. From it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.

Only Legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Legolas

Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Legolas

Yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Aragorn,Legolas

'But evil or good we will await it here.'      The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope.

He seemed to have grown in stature while Éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone.

'Many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built.'      'Five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home since then,' said Legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.'      'But to the Riders of the Mark it seems so long ago,' said Aragorn, 'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years before are lost in the mist of time.

Then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it. 'That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,' said Legolas; 'for it is like to this land itself; rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.'      'It runs thus in the Common Speech,' said Aragorn, 'as near as I can make it.

Now men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white.

But he found Gollum more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall.

He said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.

But Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible – at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'.

Gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly. `A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do – before the water boils,' said Sam. `No!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4167,"Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? '      'A present from Sméagol,' said Sam: `a brace o' young coneys; though I fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a few herbs.'       Sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half a piece of the Elvish waybread each.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4168,It seemed a feast. 'Wheew! Gollum! ' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on!,POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4169,"Frodo. I don't feel too sure of him. There's a good deal of Stinker-the bad Gollum, if you understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what I think he'd try to throttle me first now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.'       They finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4170,"The sun rose till it neared the South. The shadows shrank. `I wonder where that dratted Gollum is? ' thought Sam, as he crawled back into deeper shade. `He stands a fair chance of being spitted for an Orc, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4171,"They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of Ithilien. Sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4172,"Sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows. 'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do not well serve him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4173,"Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'       Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Sam I release from this, if you wish.'      Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annûn. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4174,"The forest where Faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. `Hungry again already?' thought Sam. `Well, now for it again!'      'Have they gone at last?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4175,"Darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth Annûn. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions. `Must get up, yes they must!' he said.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4176,"'We have walked long and far. Shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? '      'No good hiding in the dark,' said Gollum. 'It's in day that hobbits must hide now, yes in day.'      `Oh come! ' said Sam.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4177,"' said Sam. 'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again in the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.'      Gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4178,"Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not shut their eyes. It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He listened and sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of discovering the time of night. 'Are we rested?",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4179,"Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!'      'We aren't, and we haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.'      Gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours, and the hobbits followed more slowly. As soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against them.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4180,"Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. `Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. `Is that the opening of-of the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?'      `Need we think about it yet?' said Sam, `Surely we're not going to move any more today, if day it is?'      `Perhaps not, perhaps not,' said Gollum. `But we must go soon, to the Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4181,"That's the way over there yes, Master.'       The red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4182,"`It's been going on for a good while now. Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.'      Sam looked round. `Where's Gollum? ' he said. 'Hasn't he come back yet?'      `No,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4183,"Twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf's name. The time seemed to drag interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was Gollum on all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes. `Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!' he whispered.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4184,"Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering darkness. Very stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. For about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the hills.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4185,"Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. `Not that way!",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4186,"At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him was impenetrable. Gollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4187,"Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley. Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4188,"Just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'       Dizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. 'There's another stair still,' he said. `Much longer stair.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4189,"Next comes the Winding Stair.'      'And what after that? ' said Sam. `We shall see,' said Gollum softly. `O yes, we shall see! '      'I thought you said there was a tunnel,' said Sam.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4190,"'      'I thought you said there was a tunnel,' said Sam. `Isn't there a tunnel or something to go through? '      'O yes, there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. `But hobbits can rest before they try that. If they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4191,"'I don't like the look of that! ' said Sam. `So this secret way of yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all along, I suppose? '      'All ways are watched, yes,' said Gollum.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4192,"If once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under Cirith Ungol. In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo and Sam a little way within. and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the Elves.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4193,"'      `Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that. Things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain?",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4194,"I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you without your Sam knowing it.'      `Sleep!' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.'      `Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.'       And so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4195,"In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace was in both their faces. Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4196,"For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum – `pawing at master,' as he thought. `Hey you!' he said roughly. `What are you up to?'      'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam
4197,"`Nice Master!'      `I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to – sneaking off and sneaking back, you old villain?

The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage. 'This can't be the way,' Frodo whispered.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

They wheeled round, but nothing could be seen.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

4207,"O yes, Shelob will get him, not Sméagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck. Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

Then Sam played his last trick.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

With all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. Not expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his right, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Gollum,Sam

He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And he was eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end.'

It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for Boromir was a man both tall and strong.

But out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering billows, black and silver, over the starry sky. 'What do you think of that, Gandalf?' asked Aragorn. 'One would say that all the Wizard's Vale was burning.'

'What a piece of luck you had that rope!'      `Better luck if I'd thought of it sooner,' said Sam. 'Maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my pack.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4396,"And he spoke right.'      `A pity I didn't think of bringing another length,' said Frodo; `but I left the Company in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had enough we could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?'      Sam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty, thirty ells, more or less,' he said. 'Who'd have thought it!' Frodo exclaimed. `Ah!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4397,"' said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough. If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.'      `The rain's nearly given over already,' said Sam; 'but don't you go doing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven't got over that shriek on the wind yet, if you have.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4398,"Frodo, how are you going to use it? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that's no more than your guess at the height of the cliff.'      Frodo thought for a while. `Make it fast to that stump, Sam! ' he said. `Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4399,"There was one awkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on the silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: `I'm down! ' His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not see him; his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight. Frodo took rather more time to follow him.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4400,"Better put up a signpost to say which way we've gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.'      `If you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any other name your Gaffer gave you,' said Frodo. `Climb up and untie it and let yourself down, if you want to!'      Sam scratched his head. `No, I can't think how, begging your pardon,' he said. `But I don't like leaving it, and that's a fact.' He stroked the rope's end and shook it gently.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4401,"He looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewell. To the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam fell over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him. Frodo laughed. `Who tied the rope?",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4402,"' he said. `A good thing it held as long as it did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!'      Sam did not laugh. `I may not be much good at climbing, Mr. Frodo,' he said in injured tones, `but I do know something about rope and about knots.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4403,"And I put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have done, in the Shire or out of it.'      `Then the rope must have broken – frayed on the rock-edge, I expect,' said Frodo. `I bet it didn't! ' said Sam in an even more injured voice. He stooped and examined the ends. `Nor it hasn't neither.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4404,"`Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!'      'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said Frodo. Sam shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully. `Have it your own way, Mr.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4405,"He's beginning to give quite a light.'      'Yes,' said Frodo; `but he won't be full for some days. I don't think we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.'      Under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. `I'm glad we've got the rope,' he said.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4406,"It curved away on their left northward, back towards the hills. and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted. 'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I think,' said Sam. `We might find some nook there, or even a cave or something.'      'I suppose so,' said Frodo. 'I'm tired.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4407,"'Well! ' said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him. `You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I'll walk up and down on sentry for a while.' Suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped Sam by the arm. `What's that?",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4408,"Now and again it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again. `Do you think he can see us? ' said Sam. `I don't know,' said Frodo quietly, `but I think not. It is hard even for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

4410,"We did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago.'      `Well, I'm sick of him,' said Sam. `He's come once too often for me and I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I don't suppose we could give him the slip now anyway.' Drawing his grey hood well over his face, Sam crept stealthily towards the cliff. `Careful!' whispered Frodo coming behind. `Don't alarm him!",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4411,"All he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go. Things would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo sprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back Gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4412,"Poor wretch! He has done us no harm.'      `Oh hasn't he! ' said Sam rubbing his shoulder. `Anyway he meant to, _and_ he means to, I'll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that's his plan.'      'I daresay,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4413,"`But what he means to do is another matter.' He paused for a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. Sam stood glowering over him. It seemed to Frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, voices out of the past:      _What a pity Bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance!_      _Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4414,"And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders? ' He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes. Sam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was beyond argument. All the same he was amazed at Frodo's reply. Frodo looked straight into Gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted away.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4415,"No one stirred. Gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.

4416,"Suddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. Gollum bounded forward into the darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected. Sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring. Frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

4418,"You nasty treacherous creature. It's round your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.'      Gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. He did not answer Sam, but gave him a swift venomous look. `All we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said Frodo. 'We want him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs-or his arms.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4419,"At last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough. Sam was gentler than his words. 'What's the matter with you? ' he said.",POSITIVE,love,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4420,"' said Frodo. 'Sméagol,' said Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and staring at Frodo with a strange light. 'Sméagol will swear on the Precious.'

4421,"For you know where it is. Yes, you know, Sméagol. It is before you.'      For a moment it appeared to Sam that his master had grown and Gollum had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the two were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's minds. Gollum raised himself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4422,"'I will serve the master of the Precious. Good master, good Sméagol, _gollum_, _gollum_!' Suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again. 'Take the rope off, Sam!' said Frodo. Reluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about, like a whipped cur whose master has patted it.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4423,"He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him. Sam said little to him of any sort. He suspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new Gollum, the Sméagol, less than the old. 'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he said.",POSITIVE,love,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4424,"Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there was a black silence. _Chapter 2_             The Passage of the Marshes       Gollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often using his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills. `Here it is!' he cried.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4425,"'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, I'll wager – supposing as he could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one.'      They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4426,"'      The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. It was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream. `We must take a little food,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4427,"Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little. 'Look here! ' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether Gollum heard him or not. `We've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Sméagol or Gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Seriously though, I don't think there is any need for fear – at present.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4430,"Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled. 'Poor wretch!",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

To _do the job_ as you put it – what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of that?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4433,"No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo. Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he often lagged.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

4437,"For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4438,"Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4439,"And then it was gone, flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight. Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety.",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4441,"Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind. In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4442,"Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him with clumsy words. When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4443,"High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light. They had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing – unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. `I feel sick,' said Sam. Frodo did not speak. For a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to morning through the shadows.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4444,"Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4445,"A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to bc on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck. Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in Gollum.

He knelt at Frodo's feet, wringing his hands and squeaking.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4451,"His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible – at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'.

While these doubts were passing through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains.

Sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before.

Maybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in Moria far away.

For a moment he might have paused to consider Gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs almost bone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck. Frodo's head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a long while it was empty.

Frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'. As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they started out again.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4460,"Could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit? '      `Yes, perhaps, yes,' said Gollum. `Sméagol always helps, if they asks – if they asks nicely.'      `Right!' said Sam `I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.'       Gollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few mouthfuls of _lembas_ settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4461,"The early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it that way to himself.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4462,"He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: `I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no.'      Gollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder. Looking at Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4463,"`If you can't guess, you'll soon find out. And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. Don't you damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.'      While Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4464,"The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting the broth. When he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and crept along to Frodo.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4465,"When he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and crept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of peace. `Hullo, Sam! ' he said. `Not resting?",POSITIVE,love,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4466,"You'll have to sup it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. I haven't brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.'      Frodo yawned and stretched.

4468,"If it was a whistle, it did not come from Frodo's direction. There it went again from another place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill. He found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire, scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4475,"He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4476,"for it was appointed to me by Elrond of Imladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.'      Frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it; but it did not appease Faramir. `So!' he said. `You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4477,"So be comforted. Sit by your master, and be silent! '      Sam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again: 'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death have many wings.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4478,"At once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only Mablung and Damrod remained. 'Now you, Frodo and Sam, will come with me and my guards,' said Faramir. `You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4479,"In the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'       There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than ever. They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4480,"I could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead them so that they do not falter.'      With green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4481,"They have black squirrels there, 'tis said.'      `Perhaps,' said Faramir. `But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. We do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.' Sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam said nothing. For a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly Frodo fell asleep.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4482,"`Wake our guests,' he said, `and take them water. It is time to eat.'      Frodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being waited on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of water before him. 'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4483,"Now I can keep awake long enough to eat a bit.'      They were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the Men for their convenience. Before they ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise. 'So we always do.' he said, as they sat down: `we look towards Númenor that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4484,"`But if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank him.'      'That we do also,' said Faramir. After so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of Lórien. When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4485,"Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlórien.'      Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement. Frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part Boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4486,"Now I watched Boromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the road – looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to Boromir – and it's my opinion that in Lórien he first saw clearly what I guessed sooner: what he wanted. From the moment he first saw it he wanted the Enemy's Ring! '      `Sam! ' cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4487,"A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality! Ha!' He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting. Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4488,"The noise of the water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4489,"For a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep? Sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: 'It's a fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! What's going on?",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows. 'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4494,"To have found it turns evil to great good.'       Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Sam I release from this, if you wish.'      Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annûn. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. Twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo
4497,"Darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth Annûn. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions. `Must get up, yes they must!' he said.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not shut their eyes. It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering darkness. Very stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as warily as the little people can.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from old Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take. Standing there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him. Turning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side.

Then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above. `I must rest a while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. `It's heavy on me, Sam lad, very heavy.

Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers,Sam,Frodo

Frodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so the eyes advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped.

Helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the Mountain in the North.

Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck.

All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli.

Frodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas. But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white and green.

There Frodo and Sam learned much of all that had happened to the Company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.

For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Sam rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod. In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights.

When they reached _The Green Dragon_, the last house on the Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-faced. 'Like that friend of Bill Ferny's at Bree,' said Sam. 'Like many that I saw at Isengard,' muttered Merry.

There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind.

For we have need of speed greater than any wind, outmatching the wings of the Nazgûl.'      'The North Wind blows, but we shall outfly it,' said Gwaihir. And he lifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and Meneldor young and swift.

And even as he espied them and came swooping down, he saw them fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or stricken down by despair at last, hiding their eyes from death. Side by side they lay; and down swept Gwaihir, and down came Landroval and Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen them, the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire.

There he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls. It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen. As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.

And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.

And they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was Aragorn, wrapped in the grey cloak of Lórien above his mail, and bearing no other token than the green stone of Galadriel. 'I have come because Gandalf begs me to do so,' he said. 'But for the present I am but the Captain of the Dúnedain of Arnor; and the Lord of Dol Amroth shall rule the City until Faramir awakes. But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy.' And they agreed upon that.

And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Merry. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'      Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Éowyn, and last to Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. 'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

'And now, dame, if you love the Lord Faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a leaf in the City.'      'And if not,' said Gandalf, 'I will ride to Lossarnach with Ioreth behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. And Shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.'       When Ioreth was gone, Aragorn bade the other women to make water hot.

'Then in the name of the king, go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!' cried Gandalf. Now Aragorn knelt beside Faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. And those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. For Aragorn's face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of Faramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if Aragorn himself was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one that was lost.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

'I will, lord,' said Faramir. 'For who would lie idle when the king has returned?'      'Farewell then for a while!' said Aragorn. 'I must go to others who need me.' And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but Beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf
4695,"But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.'       Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days. 'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'      'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is dead.

The hideous orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised and set in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone. Now in their debate some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. 'And, maybe,' said Imrahil, 'the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark Lord than his northern gate.'      But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that Faramir had brought. For if the Ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the Eye of Mordor thither. So the next day when the main host came up, they set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor should send a force over the Morgul Pass, or should bring more men up from the South.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'      Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to Faramir, and said: 'By the labour and valour of many I have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer bring the crown to me, and let Mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his victory.'      Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, and said:      'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!'      But when Aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Gandalf

Men think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words _Isildur's Bane_, since Boromir went away. 'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in Boromir whom he loved best.

There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Denethor

At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen. As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.

'But not with your death only, Lord Faramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.'

In the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board. In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with broidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat Théoden with Éomer and Éowyn, and Dúnhere, lord of Harrowdale.

Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'      'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'

Then the king followed with Éomer on his right. He had said farewell to Éowyn above in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead.

They looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds would not go near.

When they had stood silent for a time beside the king, Imrahil said: 'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?'      And one of the guards answered: 'The Steward of Gondor is in the Houses of Healing.'      But Éomer said: 'Where is the Lady Éowyn, my sister; for surely she should be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? Where have they bestowed her?'      And Imrahil said: 'But the Lady Éowyn was yet living when they bore her hither. Did you not know?'

Her malady begins far back before this day, does it not, Éomer?'      'I marvel that you should ask me, lord,' he answered. 'For I hold you blameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that Éowyn, my sister, was touched by any frost, until she first looked on you.

I commend her to the care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.'      But Éowyn said: 'Yet now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. For this House has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.' And she remained there until King Éomer came. All things were now made ready in the City; and there was great concourse of people, for the tidings had gone out into all parts of Gondor, from Min-Rimmon even to Pinnath Gelin and the far coasts of the sea; and all that could come to the City made haste to come. And the City was filled again with women and fair children that returned to their homes laden with flowers; and from Dol Amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully in all the land; and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon horns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the vales of Lebennin.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Éowyn

Or if you desire it, we will come to Rohan and bring him back to rest with his own people.'      And Éomer answered: 'Since the day when you rose before me out of the green grass of the downs I have loved you, and that love shall not fail. But now I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal and set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will return for him; but here let him sleep a while.'

And when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to the memory of the kings, Éowyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Éomer. Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the Lords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego builder of the Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and Fréa, and Fréawine, and Goldwine, and Déor, and Gram; and Helm who lay hid in Helm's Deep when the Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that time the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: Fréalaf, Helm s sister-son, and Léofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel, and Théoden the latest.

'No niggard are you, Éomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!'      Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer.

This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.'

A large lantern, covered above, was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. There sat Théoden and Éomer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, gnarled as an old stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss. He was short-legged and fat-armed, thick and stumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist.

A great rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed that all things wept for Théoden and Éowyn, quenching the fires in the City with grey tears. It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of Gondor approaching.

Gently they laid Éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king's body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind. So Théoden and Éowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. To Merry the ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize. Slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: 'This is a tunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.'

When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen.

The slow voices of the Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and the voice of Eorl crying above the battle upon the Field of Celebrant; and the tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of Helm was loud in the mountains, until the Darkness came and King Théoden arose and rode through the Shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning. _Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising            he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.

And Faramir wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Houses of Healing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it seemed that in all the City she only was ailing and sorrowful.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Merry

Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer.

'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance.'       So at last Faramir and Éowyn and Merry were laid in beds in the Houses of Healing; and there they were tended well.

4855,"'I have not been of much use yet; but I don't want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. I don't think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, of course, the king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the Shire.'      'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and your road lies with him, I think, Merry. But do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Théoden sits at ease again in Meduseld.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden
4856,"They are overtaking us, riding hard.'      Théoden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their spears. Aragorn dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and drawing his sword he stood by the king's stirrup. Éomer and his esquire rode back to the rear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden
4857,"He had thought that this was some last trick of Saruman's, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Théoden's defence, not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword. 'All is well,' said Aragorn, turning back. 'Here are some of my own kin from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, Halbarad shall tell us.'      'I have thirty with me,' said Halbarad.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

'If these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.'      Then the Riders set out again, and Aragorn for a while rode with the Dúnedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the North and in the South, Elrohir said to him:      'I bring word to you from my father: _The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the Paths of the Dead_.'      'Always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,' answered Aragorn.

'We will make ready to ride,' said Théoden; 'but let word be sent to the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.'      The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate of the Burg to where the Riders were assembling on the green. Many were already mounted.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden
4860,"For me the time of stealth has passed. I will ride east by the swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.'      'The Paths of the Dead!' said Théoden, and trembled. 'Why do you speak of them?' Éomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the faces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. 'If there be in truth such paths,' said Théoden, 'their gate is in Dunharrow; but no living man may pass it.'      'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Éomer.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

'I had hoped that we should ride to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.'      'That road I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, Éomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should stand between.'      'You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,' said Théoden. 'It is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden
4862,"Now Théoden spoke to Éomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the Riders set forth. They rode over the Dike and down the Coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view. Aragorn rode to the Dike and watched till the king's men were far down the Coomb. Then he turned to Halbarad. 'There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

Now in the very hour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are revealed; for I showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.'      'But he wields great dominion, nonetheless,' said Gimli; 'and now he will strike more swiftly.'      'The hasty stroke goes oft astray,' said Aragorn. 'We must press our Enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my friends, when I had mastered the Stone, I learned many things.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden
4864,"On the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded Rangers. Legolas and Gimli mounted. Aragorn sprang upon Roheryn. Then Halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in Helm's Deep; and with that they leapt away, riding down the Coomb like thunder, while all the men that were left on Dike or Burg stared in amaze. And while Théoden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

But at last she said: 'Lords, you are weary and shall now go to your beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste. But tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for you.'      But Aragorn said: 'Nay, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may lie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. For I ride on an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.'      She smiled on him and said: 'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so many miles out of your way to bring tidings to Éowyn, and to speak with her in her exile.'      'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,' said Aragorn; 'and yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which I must take leads me to Dunharrow.'      And she answered as one that likes not what is said:  Then, lord, you are astray; for out of Harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had best return as you came.'      'Nay, lady,' said he, 'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere you were born to grace it.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

'that in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'      'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'      'Maybe he was called,' said Théoden; 'and my heart tells me that I shall not see him again.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. 'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor before he died: _You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory_.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Théoden

And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.'      And last of all Aragorn greeted Éomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and Aragorn said: 'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and never has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever failed the other, nor shall fail.

'Then I beg leave to depart soon,' said Frodo. 'In seven days we will go,' said Aragorn. 'For we shall ride with you far on the road, even as far as the country of Rohan.

Then Aragorn let the trumpets be blown; and heralds cried:      'Behold the King Elessar is come! The Forest of Drúadan he gives to Ghân-buri-ghân and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave!'      Then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent.

For though all lore was in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the leechcraft of Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all such sickness as east of the Sea mortal men were subject to. Save old age only.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And Gandalf answered: 'She lies within and is not dead, but is near death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told. But Imrahil said: 'So victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: 'Verily, for in the high tongue of old I am _Elessar_, the _Elfstone_, and _Envinyatar_, the Renewer': and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'      And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Merry. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'      Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Éowyn, and last to Merry.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4896,"But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.'       Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days. 'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'      'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is dead. But the full tale of the madness of Denethor should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4897,"But I do not know-'      'Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know.'      The Lord Faramir was walking alone in the garden of the Houses of Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins; but his heart was heavy, and he looked out over the walls eastward. And coming, the Warden spoke his name, and he turned and saw the Lady Éowyn of Rohan; and he was moved with pity, for he saw that she was hurt, and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest. 'My lord,' said the Warden, 'here is the Lady Éowyn of Rohan. She rode with the king and was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4898,"But Faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden, and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls. When he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and heard all that he could tell of the Lady of Rohan. 'But I doubt not, lord,' said the Warden, 'that you would learn more from the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and with the Lady at the end, they say.'      And so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they talked long together, and Faramir learned much, more even than Merry put into words; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and unrest of Éowyn of Rohan. And in the fair evening Faramir and Merry walked in the garden, but she did not come. But in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw her, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And so the fifth day came since the Lady Éowyn went first to Faramir; and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the City and looked out. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. The weather, too, was bright no longer.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4900,"It was cold. A wind that had sprung up in the night was blowing now keenly from the North, and it was rising; but the lands about looked grey and drear. They were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the Lady Éowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer-night, and it was set with silver stars about hem and throat. Faramir had sent for this robe and had wrapped it about her; and he thought that she looked fair and queenly indeed as she stood there at his side. The mantle was wrought for his mother, Finduilas of Amroth, who died untimely, and was to him but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of Éowyn.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

But she now shivered beneath the starry mantle, and she looked northward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard and clear. 'What do you look for, Éowyn?' said Faramir. 'Does not the Black Gate lie yonder?' said she. 'And must he not now be come thither?",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4902,"A sound like a sigh went up from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again. 'It reminds me of Númenor,' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself speak. 'Of Númenor?' said Éowyn. 'Yes,' said Faramir, 'of the land of Westernesse that foundered and of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills, and coming on, darkness unescapable. I often dream of it.'      'Then you think that the Darkness is coming?' said Éowyn.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4903,"And tidings now came by swift riders from Cair Andros of all that was done, and the City made ready for the coming of the King. Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of goods to Osgiliath and thence by ship to Cair Andros; but Faramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the Stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him. And Éowyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come to the field of Cormallen. And Faramir wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Houses of Healing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it seemed that in all the City she only was ailing and sorrowful. And the Warden of the Houses was troubled, and he spoke to Faramir.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4904,"For so he is, a lord among men, the greatest that now is. But when he gave you only understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a brave death in battle. Look at me, Éowyn!'      And Éowyn looked at Faramir long and steadily; and Faramir said: 'Do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Éowyn! But I do not offer you my pity. For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, beyond even the words of the Elven-tongue to tell.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And many indeed saw them and the light that shone about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the Houses of Healing. And to the Warden of the Houses Faramir said: 'Here is the Lady Éowyn of Rohan, and now she is healed.'      And the Warden said: 'Then I release her from my charge and bid her farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to the care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.'      But Éowyn said: 'Yet now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. For this House has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.' And she remained there until King Éomer came.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir
4906,"And so they came before the Gateway and halted a furlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier was laid across the entrance to the City, and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn. Before the barrier stood Faramir the Steward, and Húrin Warden of the Keys, and other captains of Gondor, and the Lady Éowyn of Rohan with Elfhelm the Marshal and many knights of the Mark; and upon either side of the Gate was a great press of fair people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers. So now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas Tirith, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of Gondor and of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the Dúnedain in silver and grey; and before them came walking slow the Lord Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And Éomer answered: 'Since the day when you rose before me out of the green grass of the downs I have loved you, and that love shall not fail. But now I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal and set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will return for him; but here let him sleep a while.'      And Éowyn said to Faramir: 'Now I must go back to my own land and look on it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when one whom I long loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.'       So the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of May the Riders of Rohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the sons of Elrond. All the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the Gate of the City to the walls of the Pelennor. Then all others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the City there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

And when Théoden was named Éomer drained the cup. Then Éowyn bade those that served to fill the cups, and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king, crying: 'Hail, Éomer, King of the Mark!'      At the last when the feast drew to an end Éomer arose and said: 'Now this is the funeral feast of Théoden the King; but I will speak ere we go of tidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he was ever a father of Éowyn my sister.

And Faramir and Éowyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there drank to them and were glad. 'Thus,' said Éomer, 'is the friendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.'      'No niggard are you, Éomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!'      Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer. Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lórien and of Rivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

None saw her last meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world. At the last before the guests set oat Éomer and Éowyn came to Merry, and they said: 'Farewell now, Merry of the Shire and Holdwine of the Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!'      And Éomer said: 'Kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.'      Then Éowyn gave to Merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Faramir

The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey.

South strode Éomer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and swept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed Dúnedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great valour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Legolas

But before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andúril like a new fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the Star of Elendil. And so at length Éomer and Aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. 'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,' said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?'

Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.

And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas. But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white and green.

First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people. And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited! This is the ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass away!'

They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends. Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the stars, recalling the ages that were gone and all their joys and labours in the world, or holding council, concerning the days to come.

But northward the white crest of Éomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men that was in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van, driving the enemy from the Gate. For a moment the thought flitted through Merry's mind: 'Where is Gandalf? Is he not here? Could he not have saved the king and Éowyn?'

It was shaped like the helms of the Guards of the Citadel, save that it was loftier, and it was all white, and the wings at either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of a sea-bird, for it was the emblem of kings who came over the Sea; and seven gems of adamant were set in the circlet, and upon its summit was set a single jewel the light of which went up like a flame.

And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.'      And last of all Aragorn greeted Éomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and Aragorn said: 'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and never has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever failed the other, nor shall fail.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Faramir

And Faramir and Éowyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there drank to them and were glad. 'Thus,' said Éomer, 'is the friendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.'      'No niggard are you, Éomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!'      Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer. Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lórien and of Rivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Faramir

At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen. As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.

'No, I am afraid not, Sam,' said Frodo. 'At least, I know that such things happened, but I cannot see them.

Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!_      And those were the words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the Sea on the wings of the wind: 'Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'      Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to Faramir, and said: 'By the labour and valour of many I have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer bring the crown to me, and let Mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his victory.'      Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, and said:      'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!'      But when Aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Faramir,Frodo

'That's hard to tell,' said Cotton.",NEGATIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Farmer,Sam

They sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the answers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire.

So he was not at home in early March and did not know that Frodo had been ill. On the thirteenth of that month Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.'      But the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty-fifth, Frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Farmer,Sam

The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey.

East rode the knights of Dol Amroth driving the enemy before them: troll-men and Variags and orcs that hated the sunlight. South strode Éomer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and swept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed Dúnedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great valour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Gimli

But before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andúril like a new fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the Star of Elendil. And so at length Éomer and Aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. 'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,' said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?'

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.

'The Gate is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?'      'In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dáin there is such skill,' said Aragorn; 'and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Glóin's son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.'       This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil should find three and a half thousands; and Éomer five hundreds of the Rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself should lead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five hundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond with the Dúnedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot and a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim that remained horsed and able to fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, should waylay the West Road against the enemy that was in Anórien.

There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Pipin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness.

And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas. But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white and green.

He was welcomed; and when they sat all at table in Merethrond, the Great Hall of Feasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder.

Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the East, but the West was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates of Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people. And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited! This is the ending.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Elrond,Frodo

For if there could be anything wanting in a time so blessed, I missed Bilbo; and I was grieved when among all the household of Elrond I saw that he was not come.'      'Do you wonder at that, Ring-bearer?' said Arwen. 'For you know the power of that thing which is now destroyed; and all that was done by that power is now passing away.

In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such company upon the road as went with Théoden Thengel's son to the land of his home.

Frodo knew that Galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell. Sam turned away and sighed: 'I wish I was going back to Lórien!'      At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of Rivendell and saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond's house.

'Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,' Frodo had answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.'

And with that he fell fast asleep again. The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all his household. As Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair journey, and blessed him, and he said:      'I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you come very soon.

There was Gildor and many fair Elven folk; and there to Sam's wonder rode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a ring of gold with a great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of the Three.

With them went many Elves of the High Kindred who would no longer stay in Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the Elves delighted to honour them.

Frodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas. But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white and green.

But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the East.'

'We will make ready to ride,' said Théoden; 'but let word be sent to the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.'      The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate of the Burg to where the Riders were assembling on the green. Many were already mounted.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5225,"A little apart the Rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed with spear and bow and sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses were strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, Aragorn's own horse that they had brought from the North; Roheryn was his name. There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star. The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his name.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5226,"Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary. 'I am troubled in mind, lord,' he said, standing by the king's horse.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5227,"For me the time of stealth has passed. I will ride east by the swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.'      'The Paths of the Dead!' said Théoden, and trembled. 'Why do you speak of them?' Éomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the faces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. 'If there be in truth such paths,' said Théoden, 'their gate is in Dunharrow; but no living man may pass it.'      'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Éomer.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry

Farewell!'      'Farewell, lord!' said Aragorn. 'Ride unto great renown! Farewell, Merry!",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5229,"At times some Rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about. All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' he said to himself reproachfully.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5230,"But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.'      'Yet it is said in Harrowdale,' said Éowyn in a low voice. 'that in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'      'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'      'Maybe he was called,' said Théoden; 'and my heart tells me that I shall not see him again.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry

'This request only did Aragorn make to me,' said Éowyn, as they passed among the tents, 'that you should be armed for battle. I have granted it, as I could. For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.'      Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry

Yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!'      And Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: 'Verily, for in the high tongue of old I am _Elessar_, the _Elfstone_, and _Envinyatar_, the Renewer': and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'      And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Merry.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry

'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'      Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Éowyn, and last to Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. 'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5234,"At least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen Rider that I can fill, and there are deeds to do. But to hope? I do not know.'       Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn standing by the bed. 'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. 'Do not be afraid,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5235,"He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the Lady Éowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'      Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And when the fragrance of _athelas_ stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said:      'I am hungry. What is the time?'      'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.'      'They will indeed,' said Gandalf.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5236,"He said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan't ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him, and that day, Pippin, when he rode up to Isengard and was so polite.'      'Smoke then, and think of him!' said Aragorn. 'For he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning. Though your service to him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.'      Merry smiled.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5237,"Though your service to him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.'      Merry smiled. 'Well then,' he said, 'if Strider will provide what is needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman's best in my pack, but what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.'      'Master Merry,' said Aragorn, 'if you think that I have passed through the mountains and the realm of Gondor with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken. If your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this House. And he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire had any virtues, but that it is called _westmansweed_ by the vulgar, and _galenas_ by the noble, and other names in other tongues more learned, and after adding a few half-forgotten rhymes that he does not understand, he will regretfully inform you that there is none in the House, and he will leave you to reflect on the history of tongues.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5238,"But it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place.'      'I know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said Aragorn. 'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!' And kissing Merry he went out, and Gandalf went with him. Pippin remained behind.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5239,"Where is that leaf? And get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.'       Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days. 'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'      'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is dead. But the full tale of the madness of Denethor should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. See that Beregond and the _perian_ who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!'

What do you seek?'      'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from Imladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord Aragorn.

'It will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,' said Legolas. 'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter the City again at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays that you and Éomer of Rohan will come down to his tents, as soon as may be.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry
5242,"Won't you tell us some more?'      'Not willingly,' said Gimli. 'For upon that road I was put to shame: Gimli Glóin's son, who had deemed himself more tough than Men, and hardier under earth than any Elf. But neither did I prove; and I was held to the road only by the will of Aragorn.'      'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Merry

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.

He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor.

Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer. Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lórien and of Rivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. None saw her last meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world.

And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited! This is the ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass away!'

And Frodo went to the King as he was sitting with the Queen Arwen by the fountain, and she sang a song of Valinor, while the Tree grew and blossomed. They welcomed Frodo and rose to greet him; and Aragorn said:      'I know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to return to your own home.

'And never before has a Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf in a contest of words,' said he. 'Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set the score right!'

'Now by Fangorn's leave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in Middle-earth.

'They are a strange company, these newcomers,' said Gimli. 'Stout men and lordly they are, and the Riders of Rohan look almost as boys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as Aragorn himself; and they are silent.'      'But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.' said Legolas. 'And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir?

In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights.

'Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,' Frodo had answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.'      That day Frodo spoke to Elrond, and it was agreed that they should leave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.'      In the evening they went to say good-bye to Bilbo.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Gandalf,Frodo

And with that he fell fast asleep again. The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all his household. As Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair journey, and blessed him, and he said:      'I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you come very soon.

Gandalf did not answer. By the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and Frodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before. After that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Gandalf,Frodo

'As well as ever, you may be sure,' said Gandalf. 'Quite untroubled and I should guess, not much interested in anything that we have done or seen, unless perhaps in our visits to the Ents. There may be a time later for you to go and see him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Gandalf,Frodo

Very tall he was, and his beard was long, and he was grey and old, save that his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and said: 'All is now ready.'      Then Círdan led them to the Havens, and there was a white ship lying, and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them. As he turned and came towards them Frodo saw that Gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the Third Ring, Narya the Great, and the stone upon it was red as fire. Then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them. But Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Gandalf,Frodo

Soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli behind Legolas, and Merry in front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly through the night.

Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Legolas,Merry

All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' he said to himself reproachfully.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Legolas,Merry

Legolas and Gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the City; for they were eager to see Merry and Pippin. 'It is good to learn that they are still alive,' said Gimli; 'for they cost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains all wasted.'      Together the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.

What do you seek?'      'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from Imladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord Aragorn.

For a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the Houses of Healing behind them; and away southward before them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of the sight even of Legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of Lebennin and South Ithilien. And now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out against the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the River. 'Look!' he cried.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Legolas,Merry

But if all the fair folk take to the Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.'      'Dull and dreary indeed!' said Merry: 'You must not go to the Havens, Legolas.

But neither did I prove; and I was held to the road only by the will of Aragorn.'      'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Legolas,Merry

Swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at Erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to Pelargir on Anduin.

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen.

Before long they marched in, a hundred strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at their head. Merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry
5443,"In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Merry and Pipin. Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday meal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the  Chief .'      'Yes indeed; the sooner the better,' said Merry.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry

It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry

'I hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.'      'You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,' said Merry.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry
5446,"'Save your breath!' laughed Merry. 'I've a better.' Then lifting up his silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the Hill; and out of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and came pouring out, and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company up the road to Bag End. At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went on; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden was full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light. There were piles of refuse everywhere.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry
5447,"'And that's the end of that,' said Sam. 'A nasty end, and I wish I needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.'      'And the very last end of the War, I hope,' said Merry. 'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed. 'The very last stroke. But to think that it should fall here, at the very door of Bag End!",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry

'But I'm sure the Lady would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered,' said Sam. 'Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,' said Frodo, 'and then use the gift to help your work and better it. And use it sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.'      So Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry
5449,"In addition to all his other labours he was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of Bag End; but he was often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early March and did not know that Frodo had been ill. On the thirteenth of that month Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.'      But the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty-fifth, Frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself.

Nothing for him marred that whole year, except for some vague anxiety about his master.

And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere.

Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.",NEGATIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Frodo,Merry

Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the East, but the West was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates of Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people.

For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Sam rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod. In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such company upon the road as went with Théoden Thengel's son to the land of his home.

They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends.

But northward the white crest of Éomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men that was in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van, driving the enemy from the Gate.

'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end they may lead,' said Gimli. 'I also will come,' said Legolas, 'for I do not fear the Dead.'      'I hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight,' said Gimli; 'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.'      'That we shall know if ever we come to Erech,' said Aragorn. 'But the oath that they broke was to fight against Sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from Númenor by Isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and upon it the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of Gondor.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

But I shall take the Paths of the Dead, alone, if needs be.'      Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon Aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At length they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.

In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn, and he drank, and he said: 'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of your House, and of you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond the shadows we may meet again!'      Then it seemed to Gimli and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

'This is an evil door,' said Halbarad, 'and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.'      'But we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,' said Aragorn. 'For if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of Sauron nearer. Follow me!'      Then Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that hour that all the Dúnedain and their horses followed him.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

The Company camped beside the Stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the Shadows that hedged them round. But when the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led the Company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. No other mortal Men could have endured it, none but the Dúnedain of the North, and with them Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves. They passed Tarlang's Neck and came into Lamedon; and the Shadow Host pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to Calembel upon Ciril, and the sun went down like blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in the West behind them.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli.

But before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andúril like a new fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the Star of Elendil.

Together the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him. 'There is some good stone-work here,' he said as he looked at the walls; 'but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better contrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of stonewrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.'      'They need more gardens,' said Legolas. 'The houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. If Aragorn comes into his own, the people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die.'

What do you seek?'      'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from Imladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord Aragorn.

But neither did I prove; and I was held to the road only by the will of Aragorn.'      'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas
5500,"Strange and wonderful I thought it that the designs of Mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was it worsted!'      'Strange indeed,' said Legolas. 'In that hour I looked on Aragorn and thought how great and terrible a Lord he might have become in the strength of his will, had he taken the Ring to himself. Not for naught does Mordor fear him. But nobler is his spirit than the understanding of Sauron; for is he not of the children of Lúthien?",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.

Legolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn and Gandalf, who went in the van with the Dúnedain and the sons of Elrond. But Merry to his shame was not to go with them. 'You are not fit for such a journey,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

But the victory did little to enhearten the captains. 'It is but a feint,' said Aragorn; 'and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to draw us on by a false guess of our Enemy's weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.' And from that evening onward the Nazgûl came and followed every move of the army. They still flew high and out of sight of all save Legolas, and yet their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the Ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off. So time and the hopeless journey wore away.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Legolas

Then all others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the City there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness. The hobbits still remained in Minas Tirith, with Legolas and Gimli; for Aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. 'At last all such things must end,' he said, 'but I would have you wait a little while longer: for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. A day draws near that I have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when it comes I would have my friends beside me.'

Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with Riders of Rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and Merry being Théoden's esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king. For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Sam rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod. In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights.

Ingold cried. 'But you come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.'      'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,' answered Gandalf.

Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. 'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see that none trouble us for one hour.'      'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he said to Gandalf.

Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish.

Denethor turned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Éomer, the king's nephew.

New forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the River; and from under the walls came the legions of Morgul; and from the southward fields came footmen of Harad with horsemen before them, and behind them rose the huge backs of the _mûmakil_ with war-towers upon them. But northward the white crest of Éomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men that was in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van, driving the enemy from the Gate.

And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls.

Then Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening crept over the fields. Now as the sun went down Aragorn and Éomer and Imrahil drew near the City with their captains and knights; and when they came before the Gate Aragorn said:      'Behold the Sun setting in a great fire!

And Imrahil said: 'But the Lady Éowyn was yet living when they bore her hither. Did you not know?'      Then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to Éomer's heart, and with it the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went swiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him.

But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white and green.

They looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds would not go near. But Éomer leaped from the saddle, and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Gandalf

And Gandalf answered: 'She lies within and is not dead, but is near death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told. But Imrahil said: 'So victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Gandalf

'But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'      And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Merry. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'

Her malady begins far back before this day, does it not, Éomer?'      'I marvel that you should ask me, lord,' he answered. 'For I hold you blameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that Éowyn, my sister, was touched by any frost, until she first looked on you. Care and dread she had, and shared with me, in the days of Wormtongue and the king's bewitchment; and she tended the king in growing fear. But that did not bring her to this pass!'

'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'

There the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the drear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and Sam spoke into Frodo's ear all that he could find words for of Gollum's treacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own adventures with the orcs.

Even so things might have gone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he had trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left grievous marks on him.

He himself, though only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of Gollum's shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again.

And while Théoden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell. The Lady Éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen than the Dúnedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since Théoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and when she heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the charge of Théoden and his knights, then her eyes shone.

'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance.'       So at last Faramir and Éowyn and Merry were laid in beds in the Houses of Healing; and there they were tended well.

But now I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal and set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will return for him; but here let him sleep a while.'      And Éowyn said to Faramir: 'Now I must go back to my own land and look on it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when one whom I long loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.'       So the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of May the Riders of Rohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the sons of Elrond. All the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the Gate of the City to the walls of the Pelennor.

This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.'

Men think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words _Isildur's Bane_, since Boromir went away. 'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in Boromir whom he loved best.

Merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5573,"There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star. The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5574,"For me the time of stealth has passed. I will ride east by the swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.'      'The Paths of the Dead!' said Théoden, and trembled. 'Why do you speak of them?' Éomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the faces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. 'If there be in truth such paths,' said Théoden, 'their gate is in Dunharrow; but no living man may pass it.'      'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Éomer.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5575,"Aragorn my friend!' said Éomer. 'I had hoped that we should ride to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.'      'That road I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, Éomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should stand between.'      'You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,' said Théoden. 'It is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5576,"Now Théoden spoke to Éomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the Riders set forth. They rode over the Dike and down the Coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view. Aragorn rode to the Dike and watched till the king's men were far down the Coomb. Then he turned to Halbarad. 'There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5577,"There were hard words, for it is long since war has driven us from the green fields; but there have been no evil deeds. All is now ordered, as you see. And your lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming.'      'So Aragorn has come then,' said Éomer. 'Is he still here?'      'No, he is gone,' said Éowyn turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the East and South. 'Whither did he go?' asked Éomer.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5578,"'Twice now, lord, I have heard of the Paths of the Dead,' he said. 'What are they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn where has he gone?'      The king sighed, but no one answered, until at last Éomer spoke. 'We do not know, and our hearts are heavy,' he said. 'But as for the Paths of the Dead, you have yourself walked on their first steps.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5579,"But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.'      'Yet it is said in Harrowdale,' said Éowyn in a low voice. 'that in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'      'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'      'Maybe he was called,' said Théoden; 'and my heart tells me that I shall not see him again.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5580,"But no answer did he ever get. For the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face; and no other tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and Aragorn may pass.'      'But how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by daring the Door?' said Éomer. 'And that way I would not go though all the hosts of Mordor stood before me, and I were alone and had no other refuge. Alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour of need!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5581,"For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and swept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed Dúnedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great valour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South. But before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andúril like a new fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the Star of Elendil. And so at length Éomer and Aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. 'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,' said Aragorn.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5582,"'Nor indeed more timely,' said Éomer. 'You come none too soon, my friend. Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.'      'Then let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!' said Aragorn, and they rode back to battle together. Hard fighting and long labour they had still; for the Southrons were bold men and grim, and fierce in despair; and the Easterlings were strong and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in this place and that, by burned homestead or barn, upon hillock or mound, under wall or on field, still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

Few ever came eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and to the land of the Haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of Gondor. Aragorn and Éomer and Imrahil rode back towards the Gate of the City, and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. These three were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath. But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5584,"Maybe a king has indeed returned to Gondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the City?'      'I have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and shouting,' she answered. 'All I hope is that those murdering devils do not come to this House and trouble the sick.'      Then Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening crept over the fields. Now as the sun went down Aragorn and Éomer and Imrahil drew near the City with their captains and knights; and when they came before the Gate Aragorn said:      'Behold the Sun setting in a great fire! It is a sign of the end and fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this City and realm has rested in the charge of the Stewards for many long years, and I fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may arise, which should not be while this war is fought.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

Men shall pitch my tents upon the field, and here I will await the welcome of the Lord of the City.'      But Éomer said: 'Already you have raised the banner of the Kings and displayed the tokens of Elendil's House. Will you suffer these to be challenged?'      'No,' said Aragorn. 'But I deem the time unripe; and I have no mind for strife except with our Enemy and his servants.'      And the Prince Imrahil said. Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is a kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this matter.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5586,"Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is a kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this matter. He is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken down. Yet I would not have you remain like a beggar at the door.'      'Not a beggar,' said Aragorn. 'Say a captain of the Rangers, who are unused to cities and houses of stone.' And he commanded that his banner should be furled; and he did off the Star of the North Kingdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of Elrond. Then the Prince Imrahil and Éomer of Rohan left him and passed through the City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the Citadel; and they came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5587,"Éomer rules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile? Shall we not send now for the Lord Aragorn?'      And the cloaked man spoke and said: 'He is come.' And they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was Aragorn, wrapped in the grey cloak of Lórien above his mail, and bearing no other token than the green stone of Galadriel. 'I have come because Gandalf begs me to do so,' he said. 'But for the present I am but the Captain of the Dúnedain of Arnor; and the Lord of Dol Amroth shall rule the City until Faramir awakes.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5588,"Do you know, I guessed it was you in the black ships. But they were all shouting _corsairs_ and wouldn't listen to me. How did you do it?'      Aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. 'Well met indeed!' he said. 'But there is not time yet for travellers' tales.'       But Imrahil said to Éomer: 'Is it thus that we speak to our kings?",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5589,"When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. 'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' he said. 'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.'      And Éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: 'First you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?'      But Aragorn answered: 'Nay, for these three, and most soon for Faramir, time is running out. All speed is needed.'      Then he called to Ioreth and he said: 'You have store in this House of the herbs of healing?'      'Yes, lord,' she answered; 'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will need them. But I am sure I do not know where we shall find more; for all things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with fires and burnings, and the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in?'      Then Éomer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if pondering anew all the days of their past life together. But Aragorn said: 'I saw also what you saw, Éomer. Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned Sorrow and pity have followed me ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and rode to the Paths of the Dead; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her. And yet, Éomer, I say to you that she loves you more truly than me; for you she loves and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of Rohan.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5591,"Once more Aragorn bruised two leaves of _athelas_ and cast them into steaming water; and he laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet. Then, whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of Westernesse, or whether it was but his words of the Lady Éowyn that wrought on them, as the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam. 'Awake, Éowyn, Lady of Rohan!' said Aragorn again, and he took her right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. 'Awake! The shadow is gone and all darkness is washed clean!' Then he laid her hand in Éomer's and stepped away.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

'It will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,' said Legolas. 'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter the City again at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays that you and Éomer of Rohan will come down to his tents, as soon as may be.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. 'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor before he died: _You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory_.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

'As for myself,' said Éomer, 'I have little knowledge of these deep matters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my friend Aragorn succoured me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will go.'      'As for me,' said Imrahil, 'the Lord Aragorn I hold to be my liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5595,"Therefore I ask the Captains: what force could we muster and lead out in two days' time at the latest? And they must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.'      'All are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous,' said Éomer, 'and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot hope to lead even two thousands, and yet leave as many for the defence of the City.'      'We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ' said Aragorn. 'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the coasts have been rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir through Lossarnach two days ago; and Angbor the fearless rides before them.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

Moreover many were bidden to follow me up the River in any craft they could gather; and with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse and foot, and yet leave the City in better defence than it was when the assault began.'      'The Gate is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?'      'In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dáin there is such skill,' said Aragorn; 'and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Glóin's son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.'       This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil should find three and a half thousands; and Éomer five hundreds of the Rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself should lead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five hundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond with the Dúnedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot and a thousand horse.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer
5597,"Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. When all was ordered, the Captains rode forth towards the Black Gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Pipin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness. They came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the battlement of Mordor. 'Come forth!' they cried.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

So now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas Tirith, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of Gondor and of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the Dúnedain in silver and grey; and before them came walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was clad in black mail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar; but his head was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver. With him were Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil, and Gandalf robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éomer

Then the blood left Beregond's face, and he was stricken to the heart and bowed his head. But the King said.:      'So it must be, for you are appointed to the White Company, the Guard of Faramir, Prince of Ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in Emyn Arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you risked all, to save him from death.'      And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.'      And last of all Aragorn greeted Éomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and Aragorn said: 'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren.

'Thus,' said Éomer, 'is the friendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.'      'No niggard are you, Éomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!'      Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer.

'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the days, it is now only May and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out.'

For if there could be anything wanting in a time so blessed, I missed Bilbo; and I was grieved when among all the household of Elrond I saw that he was not come.'

Then suddenly he knew that he must go, and say good-bye to Bilbo.

Tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. And then Faramir cried:      'Behold the King!'      And in that moment all the trumpets were blown, and the King Elessar went forth and came to the barrier, and Húrin of the Keys thrust it back; and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices the King passed through the flower-laden streets, and came to the Citadel, and entered in; and the banner of the Tree and the Stars was unfurled upon the topmost tower, and the reign of King Elessar began, of which many songs have told.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Húrin

5654,"At times some Rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about. All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' he said to himself reproachfully.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Frodo

He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Frodo

'It is a long way, is it not, from Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road.'      And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, Frodo upon his right and Sam upon his left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying:      'Praise them with great praise!'      And when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again, to Sam's final and complete satisfaction and pure joy, a minstrel of Gondor stood forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Frodo

And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted. Frodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them. Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in Mordor.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Frodo

Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!_      And those were the words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the Sea on the wings of the wind: 'Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'      Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to Faramir, and said: 'By the labour and valour of many I have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer bring the crown to me, and let Mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his victory.'      Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, and said:      'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!'

In those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house with Gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished. And Frodo said to Gandalf: 'Do you know what this day is that Aragorn speaks of? For we are happy here, and I don't wish to go; but the days are running away, and Bilbo is waiting; and the Shire is my home.'      'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the days, it is now only May and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out.'

And Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undómiel in the City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment. _Chapter 6_             Many Partings       When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companions thought of returning to their own homes.

Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with Riders of Rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and Merry being Théoden's esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king. For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Sam rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod. In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights.

And while Théoden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell. The Lady Éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen than the Dúnedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since Théoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and when she heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the charge of Théoden and his knights, then her eyes shone.

'Hail, Lord of the Mark!' she cried. 'My heart is glad at your returning.'      'And you, Éowyn,' said Théoden, 'is all well with you?'      'All is well,' she answered; yet it seemed to Merry that her voice belied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that could be believed of one so stern of face. 'All is well.

In the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board. In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with broidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat Théoden with Éomer and Éowyn, and Dúnhere, lord of Harrowdale.

'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'

And there stood Merry the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking like an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he looked on Éowyn's fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, For Snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master.

Gently they laid Éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king's body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind. So Théoden and Éowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone.

And when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to the memory of the kings, Éowyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Éomer.

And he commanded that his banner should be furled; and he did off the Star of the North Kingdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of Elrond. Then the Prince Imrahil and Éomer of Rohan left him and passed through the City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the Citadel; and they came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward. But they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay Théoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan and Gondor. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that his unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield, The light of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain, but his face was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of youth; and it seemed that he slept.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Théoden

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love of the Lord of the White Tree.'      Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. 'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor before he died: _You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory_.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Théoden

But had I done so, I should still listen to his counsel, and should not cross his will in matters of his craft, unless in some great need.'      'But I do not desire healing,' she said. 'I wish to ride to war like my brother Éomer, or better like Théoden the king, for he died and has both honour and peace.'      'It is too late, lady, to follow the Captains, even if you had the strength,' said Faramir. 'But death in battle may come to us all yet, willing or unwilling.

And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.'      And last of all Aragorn greeted Éomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and Aragorn said: 'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and never has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever failed the other, nor shall fail.

But now before you go I will confirm the words that Faramir spoke to you, and you are made free for ever of the realm of Gondor; and all your companions likewise. And if there were any gifts that I could give to match with your deeds you should have them; but whatever you desire you shall take with you, and you shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land.'

And when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to the memory of the kings, Éowyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Éomer. Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the Lords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego builder of the Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and Fréa, and Fréawine, and Goldwine, and Déor, and Gram; and Helm who lay hid in Helm's Deep when the Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that time the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: Fréalaf, Helm s sister-son, and Léofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel, and Théoden the latest.

'Almost the last drop of the Smaug vintage,' he said. 'May come in useful, if you think of getting married, Sam.' Sam blushed. 'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,' he said to Merry and Pippin, 'except good advice.' And when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion: 'Don't let your heads get too big for your hats! But if you don't finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.'      'But if you want to beat the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.'

When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons.

It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Merry

And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water.

5739,"It came from an opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was glimmering from somewhere up above. Softly Sam began to climb. He came to the guttering torch, fixed above a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the red eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5740,Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo.,NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5741,"`Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!' cried Sam, tears almost blinding him. `It's Sam, I've come!' He half lifted his master and hugged him to his breast. Frodo opened his eyes.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5742,"Frodo opened his eyes. `Am I still dreaming?' he muttered. `But the other dreams were horrible.'      `You're not dreaming at all, Master,' said Sam. `It's real. It's me.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5743,"It's me. I've come.'      `I can hardly believe it,' said Frodo, clutching him. `There was an orc with a whip, and then it turns into Sam! Then I wasn't dreaming after all when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?'      'It was indeed, Mr.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5744,"I'd given up hope, almost. I couldn't find you. Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back in Sam's gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are driven away by some loved voice or hand. Sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was not allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had still to try and save him.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5745,"How did I get here?' he asked. 'There's no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. `But you're in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you. How long ago that was I don't know.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5746,"They stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, questioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.'      `You won't, if you talk about them, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'And if we don't want to see them again, the sooner we get going the better. Can you walk?'      `Yes, I can walk,' said Frodo, getting up slowly.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

5748,"Frodo, begging your pardon. And I've kept it safe. It's round my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.' Sam fumbled for the Ring and its chain. `But I suppose you must take it back.' Now it had come to it, Sam felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again. `You've got it?' gasped Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5749,"`You've got it?' gasped Frodo. `You've got it here? Sam, you're a marvel!' Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. `Give it to me!' he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. `Give it me at once!",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5750,"`Give it me at once! You can't have it!'      'All right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!'

If it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?'      `No, no!' cried Frodo, snatching the Ring and chain from Sam's hands. `No you won't, you thief!' He panted, staring at Sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched fist, he stood aghast.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5752,"Sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had passed. There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. 'O Sam!' cried Frodo. `What have I said?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5753,"It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.'      'That's all right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rubbing his sleeve across his eyes. `I understand. But I can still help, can't I?",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5754,"And for me too. If we go together, we'd best match. Now put this round you!'      Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo's shoulders. Then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5755,"Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long. I shan't have to go far.'      `Take care, Sam!' said Frodo. `And be quick! There may be orcs still alive, lurking in wait.'      'I've got to chance it,' said Sam.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5756,"No orc would say that.'       Frodo sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another through his mind. Then he got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him, and to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into every corner of his prison. It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before he heard Sam's voice calling softly from below: _Elbereth, Elbereth_. Frodo let down the light ladder. Up came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on his head.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5757,"Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several orc-helmets. One of them fitted Frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard. `The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag's gear, was a better fit and better made,' said Sam; `but it wouldn't do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into Mordor, not after this business here.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5758,"This will hide some of the tell-tales.' He put a large black cloak round Frodo's shoulders. `Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.'      'What about you, Sam?' said Frodo. `Aren't we going to match?'      `Well, Mr. Frodo, I've been thinking,' said Sam.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5759,"`There!' he said. `Now we match, near enough. And now we must be off!'      'I can't go all the way at a run, Sam,' said Frodo with a wry smile. 'I hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road? Or have you forgotten about food and drink?'      `Save me, but so I had!' said Sam.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5760,"Foul waters and foul meats they'll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They've fed me, and so I'm better off than you. There must be food and water somewhere in this place.' `But there's no time to look for them,' said Sam. `Well, things are a bit better than you think,' said Frodo. 'I have had a bit of luck while you were away.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5761,"But come Mr. Frodo! Off we go, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!'      'Not till you've had a mouthful, Sam,' said Frodo. `I won't budge. Here, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle!",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5762,"Frodo had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground. `I can't go on, Sam,' he murmured. `I'm going to faint. I don't know what's come over me.'      `I do, Mr.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5763,"Now for it!'      Sam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it remained steady and did not pass. '_Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!_' Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his thought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song that drove away the Black Rider in the trees. '_Aiya elenion ancalima!_' cried Frodo once again behind him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5764,"Far up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek. _Chapter 2_             The Land of Shadow       Sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. 'Run, Mr. Frodo!' he cried.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5765,"There was still no sign of orcs, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazgûl; but they knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt would begin. 'This won't do, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we were real orcs, we ought to be dashing back to the Tower, not running away. The first enemy we meet will know us.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5766,"We must get off this road somehow.'      'But we can't,' said Sam, 'not without wings.'      The eastern faces of the Ephel Dúath were sheer, falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. A short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam dashed along the bridge; but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the mountain-side, loomed the Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. Suddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shattering peal.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5767,"Horns sounded. And now from beyond the bridge-end came answering cries. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, Frodo and Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs. 'Quick, Sam! Over we go!' cried Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5768,"Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall. 'Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!'      He let go. Frodo followed.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5769,"Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than a dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny bushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5770,"The thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last. 'Now down we go, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'Down into the valley quick, and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.'      Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of Mordor the Sun was climbing over the eastern rim of Middle-earth; but here all was still dark as night. The Mountain smouldered and its fires went out.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5771,"At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a boulder. Both were sweating. 'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'd shake his hand,' said Sam. 'Don't say such things!' said Frodo. 'It only makes it worse.' Then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5772,"Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my eyes just closed down on their own.'      Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. But presently he stopped again. 'It's no good, Sam,' he said. 'I can't manage it. This mail-shirt, I mean.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

'Look here, Sam dear lad,' said Frodo: 'I am tired, weary, I haven't a hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as long as I can move. The Ring is enough.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5774,"'What I really need is something warm,' he said. 'It's gone cold, or else I've caught a chill.'      'You can have my cloak, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. He unslung his pack and took out the elven-cloak. 'How's this, Mr.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5775,"I tried to remember the Brandywine, and Woody End, and The Water running through the mill at Hobbiton. But I can't see them now.'      'There now, Mr. Frodo, it's you that's talking of water this time!' said Sam. 'If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: Your Ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon. But it's a long way to Lórien.' Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the Ephel Dúath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5776,"Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison. 'Look at it, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam. 'Look at it! The wind's changed.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5777,"I wish I could see what is going on!'      It was the morning of the fifteenth of March, and over the Vale of Anduin the Sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind was blowing. Théoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields. As Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the line of the Ephel Dúath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed out of the West, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill cry, the voice of a Nazgûl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of the Ring-wraiths had met his doom.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5778,"Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven't you got some hope now?'      'Well no, not much, Sam,' Frodo sighed. 'That's away beyond the mountains. We're going east not west.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5779,"Try a bit further, and then we'll lie close and have a rest. But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves' food; it may hearten you.'      Sharing a wafer of _lembas_, and munching it as best they could with their parched mouths. Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though no more than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5780,"'Let me drink first Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'All right, but there's room enough for two.'      'I didn't mean that,' said Sam. 'I mean: if it's poisonous, or something that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, master, if you understand me.'      'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5781,"Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!'      The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank their fill, and Sam replenished his water-bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on for several miles, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold. 'This is where we turn aside, Sam,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5782,"The sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, marked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled. 'Orc-gear's no good,' said Sam, waving his arms. 'I wish I'd got an orc's hide!'      At last Frodo could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight of the last craggy ridge.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5783,"'It's getting dark again. I reckon this day is nearly over.'      Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5784,"He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. They woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready for another day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden one stage further.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5785,"Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of Barad-dûr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains thrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom. Frodo and Sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5786,"Barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it south-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying. 'I don't like the look of things at all,' said Sam. 'Pretty hopeless, I call it – saving that where there's such a lot of folk there must be wells or water, not to mention food. And these are Men not Orcs, or my eyes are all wrong.'      Neither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark sad waters of Lake Núrnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5787,"The other ran off across the valley and disappeared. For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. 'Well I call that neat as neat,' he said.

Sam broke it again, but with a whisper this time. 'Did you hear what they said about _that gobbler_, Mr. Frodo?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5789,"I think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone quite dark. So you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. If you can do it quietly.'      'I'll try,' said Sam, 'but when I think of that Stinker I get so hot I could shout.'      There the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the drear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and Sam spoke into Frodo's ear all that he could find words for of Gollum's treacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own adventures with the orcs. When he had finished, Frodo said nothing but took Sam's hand and pressed it. At length he stirred.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5790,"I have got an orc-blade, but I do not think it will be my part to strike any blow again.'      It was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless land; but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light crept back over the western heights, long after day had opened in the lands beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his times of waking Sam was busy with thoughts of food. At last when Frodo roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, he asked the question that was troubling him most. 'Begging your pardon, Mr.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

One more bite and all the food's ended, save the Elves' waybread.'      'I'll try and be a bit quicker, Sam,' said Frodo, drawing a deep breath. 'Come on then! Let's start another march!'      It was not yet quite dark again.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo
5792,"To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of Carach Angren. 'We have come to a dead end, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we go on, we shall only come up to that orc-tower, but the only road to take is that road that comes down from it – unless we go back. We can't climb up westward, or climb down eastward.'      'Then we must take the road, Mr.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

Frodo was too weary to debate the matter, and Sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten Sam's share of the food as well as his own. When Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face. It was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

Clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then under the barren stones. Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's hiding-place.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, jumping from stone to stone. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

But I'd rather have Gollum than orcs.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

It was still some way behind them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead. 'I feared it, Sam,' said Frodo. 'We've trusted to luck, and it has failed us. We're trapped.' He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

He sent his long whip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again at a brisk trot. It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo it was a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on.

He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. 'I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,' he thought.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

A troop of heavy-armed _uruks_ from Barad-dûr charged into the Durthang line and threw them into confusion. Dazed as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with him. Orcs fell over them, snarling and cursing.

A few miles to the north-east the foothills of the Ashen Mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the lowering sky. Sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take. It looks every step of fifty miles,' he muttered gloomily staring at the threatening mountain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes a day, with Mr. Frodo as he is.'

Sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing weight of the Ring, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. Anxiously Sam had noted how his master's left hand would often be raised as if to ward on a blow, or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful Eye that sought to look in them.

'It is such a weight to carry, such a weight.'      Sam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent.

At their last halt he sank down and said: 'I'm thirsty, Sam,' and did not speak again. Sam gave him a mouthful of water; only one more mouthful remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the night of Mordor closed over them, through all his thoughts there came the memory of water; and every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen, under green willow-shades or twinkling in the sun, danced and rippled for his torment behind the blindness of his eyes.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Sam,Frodo

The Lady Éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen than the Dúnedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since Théoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and when she heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the charge of Théoden and his knights, then her eyes shone. But at last she said: 'Lords, you are weary and shall now go to your beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éowyn

For I ride on an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.'      She smiled on him and said: 'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so many miles out of your way to bring tidings to Éowyn, and to speak with her in her exile.'      'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,' said Aragorn; 'and yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which I must take leads me to Dunharrow.'      And she answered as one that likes not what is said:  Then, lord, you are astray; for out of Harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had best return as you came.'      'Nay, lady,' said he, 'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere you were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road I shall take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.'

Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon Aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At length they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest. But as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with Legolas and Gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the Lady Éowyn after him and called to him.

Then she turned and vanished into the night. When the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risen above the high ridges in the East, Aragorn made ready to depart.

Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.'      'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'      'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,' said Éomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'      'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's house,' said Éowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom the Dead call.'

For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.'

Yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!'      And Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: 'Verily, for in the high tongue of old I am _Elessar_, the _Elfstone_, and _Envinyatar_, the Renewer': and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'

'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'      Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Éowyn, and last to Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed.

And soon the word had gone out from the House that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the City. But Aragorn came to Éowyn, and he said: 'Here there is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow. The arm that was broken has been tended with due skill, and it will mend in time, if she has the strength to live: It is the shield-arm that is maimed; but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm.

Then Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone. But he bent and kissed her on the brow, and called her softly, saying:      'Éowyn Éomund's daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!'      She did not stir, but now she began again to breathe deeply, so that her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éowyn

Once more Aragorn bruised two leaves of _athelas_ and cast them into steaming water; and he laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet. Then, whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of Westernesse, or whether it was but his words of the Lady Éowyn that wrought on them, as the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam. 'Awake, Éowyn, Lady of Rohan!' said Aragorn again, and he took her right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. 'Awake!",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éowyn
5964,"I do not know.'       Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn standing by the bed. 'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. 'Do not be afraid,' said Aragorn. 'I came in time, and I have called him back. He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the Lady Éowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éowyn

His grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'      Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And when the fragrance of _athelas_ stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said:      'I am hungry. What is the time?'      'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.'

Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days. 'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'

But neither did I prove; and I was held to the road only by the will of Aragorn.'      'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Aragorn,Éowyn

Then Faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls together; and he said to her: 'Éowyn, why do you tarry here, and do not go to the rejoicing in Cormallen beyond Cair Andros, where your brother awaits you?'      And she said: 'Do you not know?'      But he answered: 'Two reasons there may be, but which is true, I do not know.'      And she said: 'I do not wish to play at riddles. Speak plainer!'      'Then if you will have it so, lady,' he said: 'you do not go, because only your brother called for you, and to look on the Lord Aragorn, Elendil's heir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy.

So now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas Tirith, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of Gondor and of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the Dúnedain in silver and grey; and before them came walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was clad in black mail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar; but his head was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver.

'No niggard are you, Éomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!'      Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'      And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'      When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Éomer.

The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey.

But they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay Théoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan and Gondor. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that his unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield, The light of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain, but his face was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of youth; and it seemed that he slept.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éomer,Elrond

And Éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: 'First you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?'

Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he sent for Éomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where King Théoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond.

'The Gate is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?'      'In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dáin there is such skill,' said Aragorn; 'and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Glóin's son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.'       This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil should find three and a half thousands; and Éomer five hundreds of the Rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself should lead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five hundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond with the Dúnedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot and a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim that remained horsed and able to fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, should waylay the West Road against the enemy that was in Anórien.

They went out together.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry
5987,"I have granted it, as I could. For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.'      Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear. 'No mail have we to fit you,' said Éowyn, 'nor any time for the forging of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a knife. A sword you have.'      Merry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the shield that had been given to Gimli, and it bore on it the device of the white horse.

He had said farewell to Éowyn above in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry rode on Stybba with the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's household. They passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

Éowyn it was, and Dernhelm also. For into Merry's mind flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one that goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled his heart and great wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

Merry's sword had stabbed him from behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee. 'Éowyn! Éowyn!' cried Merry. Then tottering, struggling up, with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great shoulders bowed before her.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

Shapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded to a shrill wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world. And there stood Merry the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking like an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he looked on Éowyn's fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, For Snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master. Then Merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! Théoden opened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see her again, dearer than daughter.'      'Lord, lord,' began Merry brokenly, 'she is-'; but at that moment there was a great clamour, and all about them horns and trumpets were blowing. Merry looked round: he had forgotten the war, and all the world beside, and many hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in truth it was only a little while.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

But thereupon Éomer rode up in haste, and with him came the knights of the household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds would not go near. But Éomer leaped from the saddle, and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

And still Merry the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away the tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Éowyn had given him; and he slung it at his back. Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use his left hand. And behold!",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry
5995,"Now slowly and sadly Merry walked beside the bearers, and he gave no more heed to the battle. He was weary and full of pain, and his limbs trembled as with a chill. A great rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed that all things wept for Théoden and Éowyn, quenching the fires in the City with grey tears. It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of Gondor approaching. Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and drew rein before them.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

Already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; and now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently they laid Éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king's body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind. So Théoden and Éowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. To Merry the ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

'He has well repaid my trust; for if Elrond had not yielded to me, neither of you would have set out; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have been.' He sighed. 'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance.'       So at last Faramir and Éowyn and Merry were laid in beds in the Houses of Healing; and there they were tended well.

'But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'      And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Merry. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'

But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'

Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days. 'The Lady Éowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.'      'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is dead. But the full tale of the madness of Denethor should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. See that Beregond and the _perian_ who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!'

It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There was grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it.'      'Alas! I had heart only for myself,' said Gimli.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

When he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and heard all that he could tell of the Lady of Rohan. 'But I doubt not, lord,' said the Warden, 'that you would learn more from the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and with the Lady at the end, they say.'      And so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they talked long together, and Faramir learned much, more even than Merry put into words; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and unrest of Éowyn of Rohan.

Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of goods to Osgiliath and thence by ship to Cair Andros; but Faramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the Stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him. And Éowyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come to the field of Cormallen. And Faramir wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Houses of Healing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it seemed that in all the City she only was ailing and sorrowful. And the Warden of the Houses was troubled, and he spoke to Faramir.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King,Éowyn,Merry

None saw her last meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world. At the last before the guests set oat Éomer and Éowyn came to Merry, and they said: 'Farewell now, Merry of the Shire and Holdwine of the Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!'      And Éomer said: 'Kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.'

Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned.

Far off the shadows of Sauron hung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some great disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew aside; and then he saw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of Barad-dûr.

You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.'

5,"When they asked: 'Where is he then?' he shrugged his shoulders. He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Pippin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Merry, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight.

He waved his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Pippin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses. At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Bilbo

It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:            Farewell we call to hearth and hall!

His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic account of Bilbo's farewell party.

'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider. It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Bilbo

Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion. `It's most unfair,' said Pippin. `Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!'      `Rewards!' said Frodo.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Bilbo

'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Pippin Took!' said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground. `But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily.

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which still seemed very incomplete). or scraps of his verses, or would take notes of Frodo's adventures.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Bilbo

But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. Since Merry and Pippin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by Merry himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his _Herblore of the Shire,_ and for his _Reckoning of Years_ m which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Merry,Pippin

Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Númenor and the arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that _The Tale of Years_ was put together, with the assistance of material collected by Merry. Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention.

In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

117,"'Our last meal at Bag End!' said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden. Sam disappeared.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
118,"'I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,' he thought. 'What an inquisitive lot they all are!' He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End. Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo stepped inside the dark door.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
119,"'I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.'      'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam stoutly and untruthfully. 'No, you don't, Sam!' said Pippin. 'It is good for him. He's got nothing except what he ordered us to pack.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
120,"These tree-roots would do them good.' He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.'      'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine!",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
121,"Have you got the bath-water hot?'      Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'No, sir, I haven't, sir!' he said. Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
122,"Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?'      'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
123,"They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River. The road wound away before them like a piece of string. 'The road goes on for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest. It is high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
124,"He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right. 'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour. 'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or _smelling_ for me; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I've never seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.'      'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?' said Pippin.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
125,"'As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about it before. I might have been more careful on the road.'      'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer's stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don't see how he could have followed us.'      'What about the _smelling,_ sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a black chap.'      'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
126,"Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oak-trees. 'Don't let us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another Black Rider.'      'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!'      The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
127,"'We think you had best come now with us. It is not our custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.'      'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said Pippin. Sam was speechless. 'I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
128,"'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your journey tomorrow.'      They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
129,"'This is poor fare,' they said to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better.'      'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo. Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
130,"He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel among hobbits!'      After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes.",POSITIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam

132,"The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.'      Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for today?' asked Pippin. 'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food. 'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?' asked Pippin cheerfully.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
133,"What do you say, Sam?'      'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 'Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' said Pippin. It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain.",NEGATIVE,love,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
134,"They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to do. 'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly. Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down.",POSITIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
135,"The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them. Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:            Ho! Ho! Ho!",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
136,"Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'      Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
137,"Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!' To the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he said.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
138,"Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the _Golden Perch._ Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however long ago. After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
139,"but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll gel out a small waggon, and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.'      Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
140,"The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow _clop_ of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam

Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:      'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?'      On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
142,"I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was _scared,_ if that is possible.'      'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.'      'And what are they?'      'Black figures riding on black horses,' answered Pippin. 'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam

They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
145,"'That wouldn't be much use.'      'Wait a minute!' cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. 'We might do something with fire!'      'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside.'      'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam fiercely. 'If it don't let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.' He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes and a hatchet. Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
146,"Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading.

It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold and unlovely.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam
150,"Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do.

Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter.

Ring the bell, if you lack anything!'      So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company.

They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire. Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Pippin,Sam

All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose.

He began to suspect even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs. _Chapter 10_             Strider       Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light.

'But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches.'      'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered.

From Frodo's mind the bright morning – treacherously bright, he thought – had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
288,"But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.'      Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. 'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
289,"And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.'      'Then you are going to fly,' said Pippin. 'You won't cut straight on foot anywhere in this country.'      'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo. 'The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
290,"We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.'      _'Short cuts make long delays,'_ argued Pippin. 'The country is rough round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field.'      'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.'      'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow you into every bog and ditch.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
291,"We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?'      'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 'Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' said Pippin. It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West.",POSITIVE,love,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin

293,"They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. After half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt -I should have said no more than a mile at the widest – and we ought to have been through it by now.'      'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
294,"Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them. Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:            Ho! Ho!",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
295,"There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves. 'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was one that I never heard in the Shire before.'      'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or a signal – there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit has such a voice.'      No more was said about it.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
296,"'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.'      'One trouble after another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den. The others looked at him in surprise. 'What's wrong with old Maggot?' asked Pippin.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
297,"'What's wrong with old Maggot?' asked Pippin. 'He's a good friend to all the Brandy bucks. Of course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps ferocious dogs – but after all, folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard.'      'I know,' said Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with a shamefaced laugh, 'I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for years and years.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
298,"Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'      Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin

If you and Mr. Pippin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!'      'And so should we!' said Frodo. 'But we must be going at once, I'm afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.'      'Ah!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
301,"but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll gel out a small waggon, and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.'      Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
302,"We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight.'      It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow _clop_ of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
303,"He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End. The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:      'Look back, Mr.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin

'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo; 'but we could do with another.'      'You shall have it! Give me that basket!' said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness. It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo's new house at Crickhollow.",POSITIVE,joy,The Fellowship Of The Ring_2,Frodo,Pippin
305,"Firelight came out, and a puff of steam. 'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Merry!'      'Which order shall we go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest first, or quickest first?

There was a terrific splash, and a shout of _Whoa!_ from Frodo. It appeared that a lot of Pippin's bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.

I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was _scared,_ if that is possible.'      'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.'      'And what are they?'      'Black figures riding on black horses,' answered Pippin. 'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.'

So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot's guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo's treasure.'      'That was only a guess,' said Frodo hastily.

But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they were related to.

It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name. Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do.

Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo. In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

407,"You may be able to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front. Our roads go together – to Isengard!'      'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do what we can.'      'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
408,"Well, you can lie on the bed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!'      Merry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
409,"They woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees. 'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
410,"For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like _boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom_, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side. They had been going for a long while – Pippin had tried to keep count of the 'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand – when Treebeard began to slacken his pace.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
411,"A great _hoom, hom_ rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came from several directions a similar _hoom, hom, hoom_ that was not an echo but an answer. Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds. Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
412,"There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in. At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
413,"Before they walked away, they bowed low. This feat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. Southwards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
414,"There far away there was a pale green glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan. 'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin. 'I don't know quite where we are,' said Merry; 'but that peak is probably Methedras, and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down behind this great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, don't you think?'      'What is Isengard like?' said Pippin.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
415,"He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort to know that he had some _lembas_ in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say _he_, though I hope and guess that both Merry and Pippin were here together. There is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'      'And how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked Gimli. 'I do not know how it happened,' answered Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
416,"'Nor do I know why an Orc was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when Boromir had fallen were the Orcs content with the capture of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard. Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful comrade?",NEGATIVE,surprise,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
417,"There was little for him to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other. 'This is good tidings,' said Aragorn.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
418,"Yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. Saruman also had a mind to capture the Ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So between them our enemies have contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they would never have come at all! 'Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. No tidings of the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen of Rohan; but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the Emyn Muil and borne away towards Isengard against the will of his own servants.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
419,"Treebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the Ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth. I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and Pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him.",POSITIVE,fear,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
420,"'Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!' he said. 'We are the doorwardens. Merry, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is overcome with weariness' – here he gave the other a dig with his foot – 'is Pippin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North is our home.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
421,"'Your tongue is strangely changed; but the name sounds not unfitting so. Hobbits! No report that I have heard does justice to the truth.'      Merry bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. 'You are gracious, lord; or I hope that I may so take your words,' he said. 'And here is another marvel!",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
422,"The bread is three or four days old, I am afraid.'      Aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'Store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,' said Pippin, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts. 'And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master Gimli,' said Merry. 'This is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard calls it. Will you have wine or beer?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
423,"'Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'      'And set us a pretty riddle,' said Legolas. 'I wondered if you had grown wings!'      'Unfortunately not,' said Pippin. 'But you did not know about Grishnákh.' He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of Grishnákh's hairy arms. 'All this about the Orcs of Barad-dûr, Lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said Aragorn. 'The Dark Lord already knew too much and his servants also; and Grishnákh evidently sent some message across the River after the quarrel.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin

'Things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his Orcs set foot in Rohan.'      'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,' said Gimli. 'On the edge of the Forest.'      'When was that?' asked Pippin.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin

'Let me see,' said Merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning after the battle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. The next morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is, and the queerest thing I have ever seen in my life.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
426,"It was very exciting. But I thought it was only marching music and no more, just a song – until I got here. I know better now.'      'We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curunír, after night had fallen,' Merry continued. 'It was then that I first had the feeling that the Forest itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish dream, but Pippin had noticed it too.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
427,"Was there a date on the barrels?'      'Yes,' said Pippin. 'It was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the year before, of course, now: a good year.'      'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said Aragorn. 'Yet I think I shall mention it to Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'      'I wonder what he is doing,' said Merry. 'The afternoon is getting on. Let us go and look round!",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
428,"We also will come behind.'      'Come then!' said Gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and Théoden went beside him. The Riders of Rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. Merry and Pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe. 'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered Pippin. 'I wish I could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed!",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
429,"But if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the Shire, send me word! You know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if you can!'      'We will!' said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away hastily. Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin

Until seven times the years in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of watching him.'                              _Chapter 11_             The Palantír       The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from Isengard.

The others followed at an easy pace.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
431,"The others followed at an easy pace. Ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of Fangorn.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
432,"If it is any comfort to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the Orcs perished – it is with those little riddles that the great mind of Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Merry, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'      'Thank you!' said Merry. 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
433,"The rest, after they had supped, wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. Merry was sleepy, but Pippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned. 'What's the matter?' asked Merry.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin
434,"'What's the matter?' asked Merry. 'Are you lying on an ant-hill?'      'No,' said Pippin, 'but I'm not comfortable. I wonder how long it is since I slept in a bed?'      Merry yawned.

Now, Pippin my lad, don't forget Gildor's saying – the one Sam used to quote:_ Do not meddle in the at Fairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger_.'

'Speak!' he said.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Merry,Pippin

523,"All about lay sleeping shapes. The two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some impulse that he did not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked down at him.

He was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, between his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground. Hardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Gandalf

Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed and did not move again. 'You idiotic fool!' Pippin muttered to himself.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Gandalf

It is then his business to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.'      'How fast is he going?' asked Pippin. 'Fast by the wind, but very smooth. And how light his footfalls are!'      'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' answered Gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him.",POSITIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Gandalf

It will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.'      Pippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:      _Tall ships and tall kings   Three times three,  What brought they from the foundered land   Over the flowing sea?",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Gandalf

'What did the Men of old use them for?' asked Pippin, delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wondering how long it would last.

He sighed and fell silent. 'I wish I had known all this before,' said Pippin. 'I had no notion of what I was doing.'      'Oh yes, you had,' said Gandalf.

It was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the Emyn Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before.

He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like _boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom_, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.

Far off there came from several directions a similar _hoom, hom, hoom_ that was not an echo but an answer. Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds. Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Treebeard

Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in. At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds.",POSITIVE,anger,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Treebeard
567,"As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words – he supposed the language was Entish – Pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time (and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, since Entish was such an 'unhasty' language, whether they had yet got further than _Good Morning_; and if Treebeard was to call the roll, how many days it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for _yes_ or _no_,' he thought.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Treebeard

569,"Though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike. 'The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?'

Then he turned to Gandalf.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Treebeard
576,"The others followed at an easy pace. Ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of Fangorn.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Two Towers_2,Pippin,Treebeard

'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf, 'and speak after the Lord, if you are resolved on this.'      'I am,' said Pippin. The old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor:      'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, Pippin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.'      And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.'

But be it known that I have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be known as Pippin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words.

'I am in haste Pippin,' he said.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Paladin

Men think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words _Isildur's Bane_, since Boromir went away. 'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in Boromir whom he loved best.

There were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard sigh, and mutter: 'When will Faramir return?'      'Hullo!' said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain. 'I thought you had forgotten all about me. I am glad to see you back.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

584,"He left the Lord's council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, I thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.'      Suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. Pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but Beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of Faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. Pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the Marish of the Shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair. At last Beregond spoke with an effort.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
585,"Will no one go out to him? Faramir!'      With that Beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he loved, Pippin got up and peered out. At that moment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the North, like a small star down on the dusky fields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the Gate.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
586,"There he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls. It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man. Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
587,"Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother Boromir – whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. Here was one with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder Race.",POSITIVE,love,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
588,"He shall come with us. Indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than I do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. Come, Pippin, follow us!'      So at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the City. There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
589,"Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown. Then suddenly Faramir looked at Pippin. 'But now we come to strange matters,' he said. 'For this is not the first halfling that I have seen walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.'      At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen. As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin knew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

593,"At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than two days ago, and the miles are long from Edoras.'      It was night again ere news came. A man rode in haste from the fords, saying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was already drawing nigh to Osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments from the South, Haradrim, cruel and tall. 'And we have learned ' said the messenger, 'that the Black Captain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him over the River.'      With those ill-boding words the third day closed since Pippin came to Minas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even Faramir could hold the fords for long.

The Lord of the City sat now in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower with Pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. Most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away. 'Is Faramir come?' he asked.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

And by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the defence. No hours so dark had Pippin known, not even in the clutches of the Uruk-hai. It was his duty to wait upon the Lord, and wait he did, forgotten it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own fears as best he could. And as he watched, it seemed to him that Denethor grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and his stern mind was overthrown.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir
596,"Then perceiving that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the hidden Captain put forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers built in Osgiliath rolled forward through the dark. Messengers came again to the chamber in the White Tower, and Pippin let them enter, for they were urgent. Denethor turned his head slowly from Faramir's face, and looked at them silently.

Pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons.

'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,' said Pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of Beregond. 'Whither do you run, Master Pippin?' he cried.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

'The Lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause, save at his own command.'

604,"And he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. And I have told Beregond, but I'm afraid he won't dare to leave his post: he is on guard. And what can he do anyway?' So Pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf's knee with trembling hands. 'Can't you save Faramir?'      'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf; 'but if I do, then others will die, I fear.

Then Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. But there they found Faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

Then Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. But the servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dínen there was a great noise. Looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Faramir

So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds. But Gandalf's face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls.

608,"But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived: far too often, I guess, since Boromir departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.'      'Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!' said Pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke. 'The Lord went away from the room where Faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that I first thought he was changed, old and broken.'      'It was in the very hour that Faramir was brought to the Tower that many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,' said Beregond.

And then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed to be crying in some forgotten world far above:      'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!'

Why, it will take weeks before we get all these things sized up!'      'Weeks indeed,' said Pippin. 'And then Frodo will have to be locked up in a tower in Minas Tirith and write it all down. Otherwise he will forget half of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.'      At length Gandalf rose.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Bilbo

'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you.

'Pippin,' said Frodo, 'didn't you say that Gandalf was less close than of old? He was weary of his labours then, I think. Now he is recovering.'

'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,' he said to Merry and Pippin, 'except good advice.'

But if you don't finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.'      'But if you want to beat the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.'

Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. 'Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of Men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I will offer it, in payment of my debt.' Twitching aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet.

Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had since he parted from Merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. Before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great Gate.

At times some Rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.

620,"How glad I am to see you again! But you are worn out, and I won't bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?'      'No,' said Merry. 'Well, no, I don't think so. But I can't use my right arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed him.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
621,"You aren't fit to walk any further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.'      'It's not always a misfortune being overlooked,' said Merry. 'I was overlooked just now by – no, no, I can't speak of it. Help me, Pippin!",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
622,"'Come now! Foot by foot. It's not far.'      'Are you going to bury me?' said Merry. 'No, indeed!' said Pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart was wrung with fear and pity. 'No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.'       They turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to the Citadel.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
623,"If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.' Bergil ran on. 'I'd better wait here,' thought Pippin. So he let Merry sink gently down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside him, laying Merry's head in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and took his friend's hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
624,"At least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen Rider that I can fill, and there are deeds to do. But to hope? I do not know.'       Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn standing by the bed. 'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. 'Do not be afraid,' said Aragorn.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
625,"He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the Lady Éowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'      Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And when the fragrance of _athelas_ stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said:      'I am hungry. What is the time?'      'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.'      'They will indeed,' said Gandalf.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

627,"I shan't ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him, and that day, Pippin, when he rode up to Isengard and was so polite.'      'Smoke then, and think of him!' said Aragorn. 'For he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning. Though your service to him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.'      Merry smiled. 'Well then,' he said, 'if Strider will provide what is needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman's best in my pack, but what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.'      'Master Merry,' said Aragorn, 'if you think that I have passed through the mountains and the realm of Gondor with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
628,"We fear to say too much. It robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place.'      'I know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said Aragorn. 'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!' And kissing Merry he went out, and Gandalf went with him. Pippin remained behind. 'Was there ever any one like him?' he said.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

Legolas and Gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the City; for they were eager to see Merry and Pippin. 'It is good to learn that they are still alive,' said Gimli; 'for they cost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains all wasted.'      Together the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him. 'There is some good stone-work here,' he said as he looked at the walls; 'but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better contrived.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
630,"What do you seek?'      'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from Imladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord Aragorn. But now we wish to see our friends. Merry and Pippin, who are in your keeping, we are told.'      'You will find them in the Houses of Healing, and I will lead you thither,' said Imrahil. 'It will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,' said Legolas. 'For Aragorn sends this message to you.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
631,"I had heart only for myself,' said Gimli. 'Nay! I will not speak of that journey.'      He fell silent; but Pippin and Merry were so eager for news that at last Legolas said: 'I will tell you enough for your peace; for I felt not the horror, and I feared not the shadows of Men, powerless and frail as I deemed them.'      Swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at Erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to Pelargir on Anduin. 'Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the Black Stone,' he said. 'And lo!",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

Though it may be our part to find bitter end before the Gate of Mordor, if we do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you. Farewell!'      And so despondently Merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. Bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the Men of the City: he could not rejoin the Guard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go, as a soldier of Gondor.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin
633,"Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf reject the terms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the front rank of Gondor with Imrahil's men. For it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin. 'I wish Merry was here,' he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. 'Well, well, now at any rate I understand poor Denethor a little better. We might die together, Merry and I, and since die we must, why not?",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor.

We are knights of the City and of the Mark, as I hope you observe.'      At last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the round Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with Merry and Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while Legolas and Gimli joined them. There Frodo and Sam learned much of all that had happened to the Company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head.

638,"And my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.'      At last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company made ready to ride north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor and Rohan went to the Hallows and they came to the tombs in Rath Dínen, and they bore away King Théoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the City in silence. Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with Riders of Rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and Merry being Théoden's esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king. For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Sam rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod.

Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the Spring. Farewell!'      Last of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the old Ent, and he grew gayer as he looked at them. 'Well, my merry folk,' he said, 'will you drink another draught with me before you go?'      'Indeed we will,' they said, and he took them aside into the shade of one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set.

'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,' he said to Merry and Pippin, 'except good advice.' And when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion: 'Don't let your heads get too big for your hats! But if you don't finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.'      'But if you want to beat the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.'

It was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the 'get-up' of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off as escort to the 'prisoners'; but Merry made them march in front, while Frodo and his friends rode behind.

But many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when Merry and Pippin, who were on the east side, came across and charged the ruffians.

In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Merry and Pippin. Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons.

It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

In the meanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.

Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow, and there was much coming and going between Buckland and Bag End. The two young Travellers cut a great dash in the Shire with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. 'Lordly' folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they were unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Merry,Pippin

So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds. But Gandalf's face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls.

The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Merry and Pippin. Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
712,"'For it's only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,' he said. 'We don't know.' Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin led the way. It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
713,"'Open it!'      Inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. 'What can I do with this?' said Sam. 'Throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!' said Pippin. 'On what?' said Sam. 'Choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants there,' said Merry.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
714,"On the thirteenth of that month Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.'      But the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty-fifth, Frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done. When all was at last ready Frodo said: 'When are you going to move in and join me, Sam?'      Sam looked a bit awkward. 'There is no need to come yet, if you don't want to,' said Frodo.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
715,Few people knew or wanted to know about his deeds and adventures; their admiration and respect were given mostly to Mr. Merry and Mr. Pippin and (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles. One evening Sam came into the study and found his master looking very strange.,POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam

And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
717,"Then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them. But Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone. But even as they stood there, and the Elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste. And amid his tears Pippin laughed. 'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.' he said.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
718,"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.'      Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.",NEGATIVE,love,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam
719,"But to Sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the Haven; and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost in the West. There still he stood far into the night, hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of Middle-earth, and the sound of them sank deep into his heart. Beside him stood Merry and Pippin, and they were silent. At last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they came back to the Shire. but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Sam

'And something's wrong with the Southfarthing evidently,' said Merry. 'There's a general shortage of pipe-weed.'      'Whatever it is,' said Pippin, 'Lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.'      'Deep in, but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf. 'You have forgotten Saruman. He began to take an interest in the Shire before Mordor did.'      'Well, we've got you with us,' said Merry, 'so things will soon be cleared up.'

'I don't think you quite understand things, Pippin,' said Frodo. 'Lotho never meant things to come to this pass.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Lotho

'Of all the ends to our journey that is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-orcs and ruffians in the Shire itself – to rescue Lotho Pimple!'      'Fight?' said Frodo. 'Well, I suppose it may come to that.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Lotho
723,"And nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!'      'But if there are many of these ruffians,' said Merry, 'it will certainly mean fighting. You won't rescue Lotho, or the Shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.'      'No,' said Pippin. 'It won't be so easy scaring them a second time. They were taken by surprise.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Lotho
724,"Tooks started that. You see our dad Mr. Pippin, he's never had no truck with this Lotho, not from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this time of day, it would be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. And when Lotho sent his Men they got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, they've got those deep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, and the ruffians can't come at 'em; and they won't let the ruffians come on their land.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Lotho

For the Lord of Minas Tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son, be he man or-'      'Hobbit,' said Pippin. 'Little service can I offer to your lord, but what I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.'      'Fare you well!' said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadow fax, and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. 'May you bring good counsel to Denethor in his need, and to us all, Mithrandir!' Ingold cried.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragorn. 'Dark indeed is the hour,' said the old man, 'and at such times you are wont to come, Mithrandir. But though all the signs forebode that the doom of Gondor is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor
727,"You have had news of that ere we came?'      'I have received this,' said Denethor, and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver. 'That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' cried Pippin. 'Verily,' said Denethor. 'And in my turn I bore it, and so did each eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw in the far fields of Rhûn.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

He died to save us, my kinsman Merry and myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.'      Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. 'Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of Men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I will offer it, in payment of my debt.' Twitching aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet. A pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winter's evening, passed over the old man's face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying the shards of the horn aside.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

And we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in the days to come. Swear to me now!'      'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf, 'and speak after the Lord, if you are resolved on this.'      'I am,' said Pippin. The old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor:      'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, Pippin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.'      And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.'

732,"Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!' As he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. 'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see that none trouble us for one hour.'      'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he said to Gandalf. 'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less pressing.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the East.' He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. Was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon Pippin's face?

Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the Lord of Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. When the hour was over and Denethor again rang the gong, Pippin felt worn out. 'It cannot be more than nine o'clock,' he thought. 'I could now eat three breakfasts on end.'      'Lead the Lord Mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,' said Denethor, 'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

'Indeed you did your best,' said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, Pippin. You could not hide the fact that Boromir did not lead the Company from Moria, and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword. Men think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words _Isildur's Bane_, since Boromir went away.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

The visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.'       Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of Denethor or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the riders were out and away.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Yet we won it back in the days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. And then came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.'      'The Black Riders?' said Pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened. 'Yes, they were black,' said Beregond, 'and I see that you know something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.'      'I know of them,' said Pippin softly, 'but I will not speak of them now, so near, so near.' He broke off and lifted his eyes above the River, and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor
739,"There had already been much talk in the citadel about Mithrandir's companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty. Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble was to be 'wary' according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. At length Beregond rose.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor
740,"'Why did you bring me here?' he said. 'You know quite well,' said Gandalf. 'To keep you out of mischief; and if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on yourself.' Pippin said no more. Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, Pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved since the day before.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Presently the old man turned to him:      'Well, Master Pippin, I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, and to your liking? Though I fear that the board is barer in this city than you could wish.'      Pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or done was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of what he thought as well. He did not answer.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Pippin marvelled at the amount that the Lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad. Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. 'Go to the armouries of the Citadel,' he said, 'and get you there the livery and gear of the Tower.",NEGATIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

So at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the City. There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

'For this is not the first halfling that I have seen walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.'      At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

You are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. Were it buried beneath the roots of Mindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.'      For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced. Pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. But suddenly Denethor relaxed and grew cold again.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

The Lord of the City sat now in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower with Pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. Most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away. 'Is Faramir come?' he asked.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

And by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the defence. No hours so dark had Pippin known, not even in the clutches of the Uruk-hai. It was his duty to wait upon the Lord, and wait he did, forgotten it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own fears as best he could. And as he watched, it seemed to him that Denethor grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and his stern mind was overthrown.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

Pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons.

'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,' said Pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of Beregond. 'Whither do you run, Master Pippin?' he cried.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Denethor

But Pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy.

For there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood Beregond, clad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the door against them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.

He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor.

But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the East.' He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older.

Proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother Boromir – whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before.

'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die.

What is the time?'      'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.'      'They will indeed,' said Gandalf.

The Hobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had never failed them and he had been their guide through many perils. 'I wish we could have a Stone that we could see all our friends in,' said Pippin, 'and that we could speak to them from far away!'

So say I, Pippin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.'      And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.'

'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see that none trouble us for one hour.'      'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he said to Gandalf.

'Indeed you did your best,' said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, Pippin. You could not hide the fact that Boromir did not lead the Company from Moria, and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword.

And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty. Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish.

He was too great to be subdued to the will of the Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.'      'Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!' said Pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke. 'The Lord went away from the room where Faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that I first thought he was changed, old and broken.'

Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind. Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to Belfalas in the South.

If Gondor falls, or the Ring is taken, then the Shire will be no refuge.'      'You do not comfort me,' said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon.

Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed.

To his left lay a sea of mist, rising to a bleak shadow in the East; but to his right great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the West to a steep and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier, carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come.

And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. Even as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white, blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the City. Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the topmost walls' shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets. So Gandalf and Pippin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
800,"Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than Isengard, and far more beautiful. Yet it was in truth falling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there. In every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now they were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from door or empty window. At last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. Gandalf dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
801,"A sweet fountain played there in the morning sun, and a sward of bright green lay about it; but in the midst. drooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water. Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended. _Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree._      The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
802,"_Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree._      The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. And then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of stone. They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. 'Be careful of your words, Master Pippin! This is no time for hobbit pertness.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
803,"I will deal with that in due time. And say nothing about Aragorn either, unless you must.'      'Why not? What is wrong with Strider?' Pippin whispered. 'He meant to come here, didn't he? And he'll be arriving soon himself anyway.'      'Maybe, maybe,' said Gandalf.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
804,"It will be better so. At least he should come unheralded by us.'      Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. 'See, Master Pippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of Gondor; though it might have been better, if you had learned something of it, when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the Shire. Do as I bid! It is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will, if he comes, claim the kingship.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
805,"For you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South. And we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in the days to come. Swear to me now!'      'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf, 'and speak after the Lord, if you are resolved on this.'      'I am,' said Pippin. The old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor:      'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, Pippin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.'      And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.' Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
806,"Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!' As he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. 'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see that none trouble us for one hour.'      'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he said to Gandalf. 'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less pressing.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
807,"'For I have not ridden hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. Is it naught to you that Théoden has fought a great battle and that Isengard is overthrown, and that I have broken the staff of Saruman?'      'It is much to me. But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the East.' He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
808,"But sit now!'       Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. Was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon Pippin's face? 'Now tell me your tale, my liege,' said Denethor, half kindly; half mockingly. 'For the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed.'      Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the Lord of Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
809,"And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?' And with that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. Gandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went. Their guide brought them from the doors of the hall, and then led them across the Court of the Fountain into a lane between tall buildings of stone.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
810,"It was sparely furnished, having but a small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing. There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of Anduin, still shrouded in mists, towards the Emyn Muil and Rauros far away. Pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill. 'Are you angry with me, Gandalf?' he said, as their guide went out and closed the door. 'I did the best I could.'      'You did indeed!' said Gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing out of the window.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
811,"I must go to this lords' council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see as much of it as any, Pippin son of Paladin, soldier of Gondor. Sharpen your blade!'      Gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. 'I am in haste Pippin,' he said.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
812,"These people are kindly to beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than some.'       With that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. Three strokes it rang, like silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the sun. After a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. The sun was now shining warm and bright, and the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. High in the blue air Mount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
813,"Then there is the nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the daymeal, and such mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset. 'Come! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.'      'One moment!' said Pippin blushing. 'Greed, or hunger by your courtesy, put it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call him, asked me to see to his horse – Shadowfax, a great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the king's eye, I am told, though he has given him to Mithrandir for his services.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

I think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat Shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit, if it is possible.'      'Hobbit?' said Beregond. 'That is what we call ourselves,' said Pippin. 'I am glad to learn it,' said Beregond, 'for now I may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. But come!",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
815,"For in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of Denethor or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the riders were out and away. Shadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his head. 'Good morning!' said Pippin. 'Gandalf will come as soon as he may.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
816,For a little while. But we await now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes.'      'When?' said Pippin. 'Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons last night and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun.,POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
817,"If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?'      'Nay, nay,' Beregond laughed, 'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of the Citadel. Yet, Master Pippin, to be only a man of arms of the Guard of the Tower of Gondor is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in the land.'      'Then it is far beyond me,' said Pippin. 'Take me back to our room, and if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like – as your guest.'       Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went with Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third Company. And it seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was very welcome.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
818,"There had already been much talk in the citadel about Mithrandir's companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty. Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble was to be 'wary' according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. At length Beregond rose.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again. 'Can you find your way?' said Beregond at the door of the small hall, on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat.

He got down and closed the shutter and went to bed.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, Pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for a while standing unheeded.

'Yes,' said Pippin, 'very: tired out with idleness and waiting.

It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the Gate. It seemed to Pippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in the walls, a great voice calling. 'Gandalf!' he cried. 'Gandalf!",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf
830,"Gandalf, Gandalf!' he shouted wildly, like an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement. But now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer. One wheeled towards him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised his hand, and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. The Nazgûl gave a long wailing cry and swerved away; and with that the four others wavered, and then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the lowering cloud above; and down on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less dark. Pippin watched, and he saw the horseman and the White Rider meet and halt, waiting for those on foot.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man. Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

So at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the City. There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown. Then suddenly Faramir looked at Pippin. 'But now we come to strange matters,' he said. 'For this is not the first halfling that I have seen walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.'

Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen. As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.

You are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. Were it buried beneath the roots of Mindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.'      For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced.

And all that night Pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward.

So Pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf's knee with trembling hands. 'Can't you save Faramir?'      'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf; 'but if I do, then others will die, I fear. Well, I must come, since no other help can reach him.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

At the gate of the Citadel they found no guard. 'Then Beregond has gone,' said Pippin more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the road to the Closed Door. It stood wide open, and the porter lay before it.",NEGATIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

For there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood Beregond, clad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the door against them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.

Then Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. But there they found Faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

Then Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. But the servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dínen there was a great noise. Looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Pippin,Gandalf

So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds. But Gandalf's face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls.

Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn standing by the bed. 'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die.

And when the fragrance of _athelas_ stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said:      'I am hungry. What is the time?'      'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.'      'They will indeed,' said Gandalf.

'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you.

At last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. Gandalf dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master. The Guards of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of strange shape, high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face, and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for they were indeed wrought of _mithril_, heirlooms from the glory of old days.",POSITIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin

It was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far into the West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as Frodo saw it at the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But to the fields of the Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were brown and drear.

As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.

894,"'Well, we've come back none too soon,' said Merry. 'Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,' said Frodo. 'Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.'      'Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?' said Pippin.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
895,"He's a prisoner in Bag End now, I expect, and very frightened. We ought to try and rescue him.'      'Well I am staggered!' said Pippin. 'Of all the ends to our journey that is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-orcs and ruffians in the Shire itself – to rescue Lotho Pimple!'      'Fight?' said Frodo. 'Well, I suppose it may come to that. But remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone over to the other side.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
896,"And nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!'      'But if there are many of these ruffians,' said Merry, 'it will certainly mean fighting. You won't rescue Lotho, or the Shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.'      'No,' said Pippin. 'It won't be so easy scaring them a second time. They were taken by surprise.",POSITIVE,surprise,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
897,"'If Tooks don't come sooner, we'd best get behind cover and shoot without arguing. There's got to be some fighting before this is settled, Mr. Frodo.'      The Tooks did come sooner. Before long they marched in, a hundred strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at their head. Merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
898,"In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Merry and Pippin. Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday meal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the  Chief .'      'Yes indeed; the sooner the better,' said Merry.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
899,"'For it's only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,' he said. 'We don't know.' Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin led the way. It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.",NEGATIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
900,"In addition to all his other labours he was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of Bag End; but he was often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early March and did not know that Frodo had been ill. On the thirteenth of that month Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.'      But the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty-fifth, Frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.",NEGATIVE,fear,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
901,"In the meanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done. When all was at last ready Frodo said: 'When are you going to move in and join me, Sam?'      Sam looked a bit awkward. 'There is no need to come yet, if you don't want to,' said Frodo. 'But you know the Gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after by Widow Rumble.'      It's not that, Mr. Frodo, said Sam, and he went very red.",POSITIVE,sadness,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
902,"It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you. And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone.",POSITIVE,joy,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
903,"But even as they stood there, and the Elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste. And amid his tears Pippin laughed. 'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.' he said. 'This time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!'      'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together 'than one alone.",POSITIVE,anger,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
904,"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.'      Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.",NEGATIVE,love,The Return Of The King_2,Frodo,Pippin
