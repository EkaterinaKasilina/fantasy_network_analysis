"'Queen Calanthe, the Lionness of Cintra, had a daughter called Pavetta. She died, together with her  husband, in a tempest which struck out at sea, and the depths swallowed them both.'  'So you see for yourselves I'm not making this up!' The ironware gnome called everyone to be his  witnesses. 'The Princess of Cintra was called Pavetta, not Ciri.'  'Ciri, known as Ciri, was the daughter of this drowned Pavetta,' explained the red-haired man. 'Calanthe's granddaughter. She was not the princess herself, but the daughter of the Princess of Cintra.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"But the Geralt  could neither find her nor collect her. And here our poet has missed the truth.'  'Oh yes, he's missed the truth indeed,' butted in a sinewy young man who, judging by his clothes, was a  journeyman on his travels prior to crafting his masterpiece and passing his master's exams. 'The Geralt's  destiny bypassed him: Ciri was killed during the siege of Cintra. Before throwing herself from the  tower, Queen Calanthe killed the princess's daughter with her own hand, to prevent her from falling into  the Nilfgaardians' claws alive.'  'It wasn't like that. Not like that at all!' objected the red-haired man.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"If I am not mistaken, the true  destinies of real people inspired the beautiful work I heard beneath the oak tree? I have in mind ... Little  Ciri of Cintra. Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.'  Dandelion gazed at the ceiling, drumming his fingers on the table. 'Honoured sir,' he said dryly, 'you are interested in strange matters.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"So I advise you to weigh each word with  care, you piece of scum. So, let's get on with it and stop wasting time. As you know, I'm interested in the  heroine of one of your beautiful ballads, Queen Calanthe of Cintra's granddaughter, Princess Ciri,  endearingly known as Ciri. According to eye-witnesses this little person died during the siege of the town,  two years ago. Whereas in your ballad you so vividly and touchingly described her meeting a strange,  almost legendary individual, the ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"On these windmills and pendulums of yours, on this Killer path of  yours, dozens of boys have broken their bones and twisted their necks, boys who were hard, seasoned  vagabonds like you, found on roads and pulled out of gutters. Sinewy scamps and good-for-nothings,  pretty experienced despite their short lives. What chance has Ciri got? Even though she's been brought  up in the south with elven methods, even growing up under the hand of a battle-axe like Lioness  Calanthe, that little one was and still is a princess. Delicate skin, slight build, light bones ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"You were at  Sodden, Angren and Transriver. You know what happened to Cintra, know what befell Queen Calanthe  and many thousands of people there. You know the hell Ciri went through, know why she cries out at  night. And I know, too, because I was also there. I'm afraid of pain and death too, even more so now  than I was then - I have good reason.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"The knight  cleared his throat and looked down. Geralt smiled faintly. Over the last two years Ciri had almost  forgotten her origins and had almost entirely lost her royal manners and airs, but her glare, when she  wanted, was very much like that of her grandmother. So much so that Queen Calanthe would no doubt  have been very proud of her granddaughter. 'Yeeessss, what was I ...' the knight stammered, tugging at his belt with embarrassment.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"And vice-versa. But the novices, however, did sneak keen glances at the  boy and chatted freely, discussing the various possibilities presented by the presence on the Temple  grounds of something which wore trousers. Ciri was amazed because Jarre was the exact opposite of  everything which, in her eyes, should represent an attractive male. In Cintra, as she remembered, an  attractive man was one whose head reached the ceiling, whose shoulders were as broad as a doorway,  who swore like a dwarf, roared like a buffalo and stank at thirty paces of horses, sweat and beer,  regardless of what time of day or night it was. Men who did not correspond to this description were not  recognised by Queen Calanthe's chambermaids as worthy of sighs and gossip.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"About Cintra. 'How did you get out of the town, Ciri? How did you slip past the Nilfgaardians?'  Ciri did not remember. Everything broke off, was lost in obscurity and smoke. She remembered the  siege, saying goodbye to Queen Calanthe, her grandmother; she remembered the barons and knights    forcibly dragging her away from the bed where the wounded, dying Lioness of Cintra lay.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"But Uncle Crach an Craite, the Earl of  Skellige, still kneeling with bowed head, greeted the Lioness of Cintra with a title which was less official  but considered by the islanders to be more venerable. 'Hail, Modron.'  'Princess,' said Calanthe in a cold and authoritative voice, without so much as a glance at the earl, 'come  here. Come here to me, Ciri.'  Her grandmother's hand was as strong and hard as a man's, her rings cold as ice. 'Where is Eist?'  'The King ...' stammered Crach. 'Is at sea, Modron.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"And you ... You have a huge debt to repay  me, Crach. One day I will demand repayment.'  'I know, Modron.'  'If I do not claim it, she will do so.' Calanthe looked at Ciri. 'You will repay the debt to her, Earl. You  know how.'  Crach an Craite got to his feet, straightened himself and the features of his weatherbeaten face hardened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Calanthe
"'Two proved enough. But still complicated, I must admit.'  'Such foul weather everywhere?'  'Everywhere.'  'So let us fortify ourselves with good fare and an old red wine from Cidaris. Lydia, would you be so  kind?'  Lydia van Bredevoort, Vilgefortz's assistant and personal secretary, appeared from behind the curtain  like an ethereal phantom and smiled with her eyes at Tissaia de Vries. Tissaia, controlling her face,  replied with a pleasant smile and bow of her head. Artaud Terranova stood up and bowed with  reverence.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"Tissaia de Vries ate slowly, devoting more attention to arranging her plates,  cutlery and napkins symmetrically - although, in her opinion, they still lay irregularly and hurt her  predilection for order and her aesthetic sensibility - than to the fare. She drank sparingly. Vilgefortz ate  and drank even more sparingly. Lydia, of course, did not drink or eat at all. The candle flames undulated in long red and golden whiskers of fire.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"The  Chapter wants to assume a unanimous stand in this matter. And, should it come to action, we also want  to act unanimously. So what do you advise?'  'It flatters me greatly' with a gesture, Vilgefortz thanked Lydia,  who was offering to put more broccoli on his plate - 'that my opinion in this matter should be decisive for  the Chapter.'  'No one said that.' Artaud poured himself some more wine. 'We're going to make a collective decision  anyway, when the Chapter meets. But we wish to let everybody have the opportunity to express  themselves beforehand so we can have an idea of all the various views.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"It served for the detection of persons who  had disappeared while enabling a psychic vision by means of the 'crystal, metal, stone' method. The  wizard was either searching for someone or resolving a theoretical, logistical problem. Vilgefortz of  Roggeveen was well known for his love of solving such problems. They sat down in carved ebony armchairs. Lydia glanced at Vilgefortz, caught the sign transmitted by his  eye and immediately left.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"Lydia glanced at Vilgefortz, caught the sign transmitted by his  eye and immediately left. Tissaia sighed imperceptibly. Everyone knew that Lydia van Bredevoort was in love with Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, that she had loved  him for years with a silent, relentless and stubborn love. The wizard, it is to be understood, also knew  about this but pretended not to. Lydia made it easier for him by never betraying her feelings to him she  never  took the slightest step or made the slightest gesture, transmitted no sign by thought and, even if she could  speak, would never have said a word.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"Lydia made it easier for him by never betraying her feelings to him she  never  took the slightest step or made the slightest gesture, transmitted no sign by thought and, even if she could  speak, would never have said a word. She was too proud. Vilgefortz, too, did nothing because he did  not love Lydia. He could, of course, simply have have made her his lover, tied her to him even more  strongly and, who knows, maybe even made her happy. There were those who advised him to do so.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"And what does she have to do  with Ithlin's prophecy? Or with the Elder Blood of the Elves? What are you brewing, Vilgefortz? I'm sorry, said Lydia van Bredevoort telepathically, coming in without a sound. The wizard stood up.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"She could not do so any other way. The lower half of Lydia van Bredevoort's face was an illusion. Four years ago, on Vilgefortz's - her master's - recommendation, Lydia had taken part in experiments  concerning the properties of an artefact found amongst the excavations of an ancient necropolis. The  artefact turned out to be cursed. It activated only once.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"A powerful illusion was therefore drawn so that people did not faint at the sight of Lydia's  face. It was a very  strong, very efficiently placed illusion, difficult for even the Chosen Ones to penetrate. 'Hmm ...' Vilgefortz put the letter aside. 'Thank you, Lydia.'  Lydia smiled. The messenger is waiting for a reply, she said.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Lydia
"'Calanthe's granddaughter. She was not the princess herself, but the daughter of the Princess of Cintra. She was the Child Surprise destined for the Geralt, the man to whom - even before she was born - the  queen had sworn to hand her granddaughter over to, just as Master Dandelion has sung. But the Geralt  could neither find her nor collect her. And here our poet has missed the truth.'  'Oh yes, he's missed the truth indeed,' butted in a sinewy young man who, judging by his clothes, was a  journeyman on his travels prior to crafting his masterpiece and passing his master's exams.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Calanthe
"Before throwing herself from the  tower, Queen Calanthe killed the princess's daughter with her own hand, to prevent her from falling into  the Nilfgaardians' claws alive.'  'It wasn't like that. Not like that at all!' objected the red-haired man. 'The princess's daughter was killed  during the massacre while trying to escape from the town.'  'One way or another,' shouted Ironware, 'the Geralt didn't find Ciri! The poet lied!'  'But lied beautifully,' said the elf in the toque, snuggling up to the tall, fair-haired elf. 'It's not a question of poetry but of facts!' shouted the journeyman.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Calanthe
"The Geralt-'  'Talk about the girl. For the moment I'm not interested in the Geralt.'  'I don't know anything about the girl! I only know that the Geralt was going to fetch her from Cintra  when the war broke out. I met him at the time. He heard about the massacre, about Calanthe's death,  from me ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Calanthe
"'But thank you for the  information. It was valuable.'  'Let it be,' he replied with a smile, 'my contribution to making changes for the better. Tell me, Yennefer,  why is Nilfgaard so interested in Geralt and the girl from Cintra?'  'Don't stick your nose into that business.' She suddenly turned serious. 'I said you were to forget you ever  heard of Calanthe's granddaughter.'  'Indeed, you did. But I'm not searching for a subject for a ballad.'  'What the hell are you searching for then?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Calanthe
"You have a gravely sick woman on your  shoulders and this brat ...'  Ciri, who was trying to clean her dung-smeared boot on a ladder rung, raised her head. The knight  cleared his throat and looked down. Geralt smiled faintly. Over the last two years Ciri had almost  forgotten her origins and had almost entirely lost her royal manners and airs, but her glare, when she  wanted, was very much like that of her grandmother.

Men who did not correspond to this description were not  recognised by Queen Calanthe's chambermaids as worthy of sighs and gossip. Ciri had also seen a  number of different men the wise and gentle druids of Angren, the tall and gloomy settlers of Sodden, the  Geralts of Kaer Morhen. Jarre was different. He was as skinny as a stick-insect, ungainly, wore clothes  which were too large and smelled of ink and dust, always had greasy hair and on his chin, instead of  stubble, there were seven or eight long hairs, about half of which sprang from a large wart.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Calanthe
"Tissaia de Vries, The Poisoned Source   CHAPTER SEVEN    'I'm going to tell you something,' said Iola the Second suddenly, resting the basket of grain on her hip. 'There's going to be a war. That's what the duke's greeve who came to fetch the cheeses said.'  'A war?' Ciri shoved her hair back from her forehead. 'With who? Nilfgaard?'  'I didn't hear,' the novice admitted.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"Who else? Again! Oh gods, that's terrible!'  'Aren't you exaggerating a bit with this war, Iola?' Ciri scattered some grains for the chickens and  guinea-hens crowding around them in a busy, noisy whirl. 'Maybe it's only another raid on the Scoia'tael?'  'Mother Nenneke asked the greeve the same thing,' declared Iola the Second. 'And the greeve said that  no, this time it wasn't about the Squirrels.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"They don't have any time for work because they are, apparently,  studying Geralty. But in actual fact they're probably only idling or skipping around the park thrashing  weeds with a stick. You know who I'm talking about, Ciri, don't you?'  'Ciri will leave for the war no doubt,' giggled Iola the Second. 'After all, she is apparently the daughter of  a knight! And herself a great warrior with a terrible sword!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"'Not for show. Eh, Iola? It's exactly as if I were hearing  that hag Yennefer talk!'  'Ciri is getting more and more like her,' appraised Iola, sniffing ostentatiously. 'She even smells like her. Huh, no doubt some magical scent made of mandrake or ambergris.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"Both in the kitchen and in the garden! Look at her little hands,  Iola! Like a princess!'  'That's the way it is!' squeaked Ciri. 'Some have brains, so they get a book! Others are feather-brained,  so they get a broom!'  'And you only use a broom for flying, don't you?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"Pathetic wizard!'  'You're stupid!'  'Stupid yourself!'  'No, I'm not!'  'Yes, you are! Come on, Iola, don't pay any attention to her. Sorceresses are not our sort of company.'  'Of course they aren't!' yelled Ciri and threw the basket of grain on the ground. 'Chickens are your sort  of company!'     The novices turned up their noses and left, passing through the hoard of cackling fowl. Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"The priestess grimaced with animosity. And Iola the First came up to me with a strange  expression of her face. 'Get yourself together, Ciri,' she said, 'and go the refectory, quick. Mother  Nenneke is summoning you. Someone has arrived.'  Strange, meaningful glances, excitement in their eyes.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"I'm too young.'  'I was younger than you when I started.'  'But I'm sure you weren't ...'  'What do you mean, girl? Stop stuttering! At least one full sentence, please.'  'Because ...' Ciri lowered her head and blushed. 'Because Iola, Myrrha, Eurneid and Katye - when  we were having dinner - laughed at me and said that witchcraft doesn't have access to me and that I'm  not going to perform any magic because ... Because I'm ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola
"Yennefer was firm, frequently  stern, sometimes masterfully formidable. But she was never boring. Previously, Ciri could barely keep  her eyes open in the Temple school and would  sometimes even doze off during a lesson, lulled by the monotonous, gentle voice of Nenneke, Iola the  First, Hrosvitha or some other teacher. With Yennefer, it was impossible. And not only because of the  timbre of the lady magician's voice and the short, sharply accentuated sentences she used.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Iola

Your songs mention no names, but we know the Geralt you sing of is no other than the famous Geralt of  Rivia, and the enchantress for whom he burns with love is the equally famous Yennefer.

'Tell me, Yennefer,  when did you last see Geralt?'  'A long time ago.'  'After the war?'  After the war ...' Yennefer's voice changed a little. 'No, I never saw him after the war.

"That was followed by a short-lived and entertaining fascination with the same sex, which  ended in the conclusion that soiling towels, passing wind and greediness were by no means exclusively  male attributes. Finally, like all but a few magicians, Triss moved to affairs with other wizards, which  proved sporadic and frustrating in their cold, technical and almost ritual course. Then Geralt of Rivia appeared. A Geralt leading a stormy life, and tied to her good friend Yennefer in a  strange, turbulent and almost violent relationship. Triss had watched them both and was jealous even though it seemed there was little to be jealous of.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"It had fascinated  her to such an extent that ... ... she had seduced the Geralt - with the help of a little magic. She had hit on a propitious moment, a  moment when he and Yennefer had scratched at each other's eyes yet again and had abruptly parted. Geralt had needed warmth, and had wanted to forget.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"No, Triss had not desired to take him away from Yennefer. As a matter of fact, her friend was more  important to her than he was. But her brief relationship with the Geralt had not disappointed. She had  found what she was looking for - emotions in the form of guilt, anxiety and pain. His pain.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"The wind howled, banged the shutter and swelled the tapestry. Triss rolled on to her back and, lost in  thought, started to bite her thumb nail. Geralt had not invited Yennefer. He had invited her. Does that mean ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty. 'I'm not important. I let you down.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer

There was a moment, when I threw up from fear, when Yennefer and Coral  held me up by the shoulders and hair-'  'Stop. Please, stop.'  'No, Geralt. I won't. After all, you want to know what happened there, on the Hill.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"Of those who had known me well, Yennefer  was the only one to survive, and Yennefer was blind. Others knew me fleetingly and always recognised  me by my beautiful hair. And I, damn it, didn't have it any more!'  Geralt held her closer. She no longer tried to push him away. 'They used the highest magics on us,' she continued in a muted voice, 'spells, elixirs, amulets and  artefacts.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"This one concerned a hunt for a golden dragon who instead of allowing itself to be  hunted down had counted the hunters' bones and then eaten  a cobbler called Goatmuncher. Ciri began to listen with greater interest. Geralt asked about what had happened to the Slashers but Yarpen didn't know. Yarpen, in turn, was  curious about a woman called Yennefer, at which Geralt grew oddly uncommunicative. The dwarf drank  more beer and started to complain that Yennefer still bore him a grudge although a good few years had  gone by since those days.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
Your letters  invariably give me boundless pleasure. Your friend Yennefer  The letter smelled of lilac and gooseberries. Geralt cursed.

A black burgee dotted with silver  lilies fluttered lazily from its mast. The crew consisted of several men wearing the pointed hats of  Temerian Guards.

The customs officer  watched him in silence.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"Eh, Dandelion? What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'

"Tretogor? Dijkstra?'  'You've guessed.'  'That's still no reason-'  'It's reason enough,' interrupted Dandelion. 'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt. They're after the girl and Yennefer. Dijkstra wants to know where they are.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"You're studying medicine, are you, Shani? What year?'  'Third,' grunted the girl. 'Ah,' Philippa Eilhart was looking not at her but at the Geralt, 'seventeen, what a beautiful age. Yennefer  would give a lot to be that age again. What do you reckon, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"And guard that child, damn it! Guard that girl as though she's the apple of  your eye! And if you can't do so yourself, ask others to!'  For a moment Dandelion thought the Geralt was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer. He    would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"I'll fall asleep, she thought, carefully and delicately feeling her nose which was still tender, painful and  blocked with clotted blood. I'll go back to my dream. I'll see what Geralt is doing there, in the night, in  the rain, by the canal ... Yennefer was holding her by the hand. They were both walking  down a long, dark corridor, between stone columns or, perhaps, statues.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"At one time she was closely tied to ... a certain Geralt. Geralt, if I'm not mistaken. It seems it wasn't just an ordinary passing affair. It appeared Yennefer was  quite strongly involved ...'  Tissaia de Vries sat up straight and gripped the armrests of her chair.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"But  I'm not being guided by unhealthy curiosity but concern about the emotional state of a member of the  Council. I am wondering about Yennefer's reaction to the news of ... of Geralt's death. I presume she  would get over it, come to terms with it, without falling into a depression or exaggerated mourning?'  'No doubt, she would,' said Tissaia coldly. 'Especially as such news has been reaching her every now  and again - and always proving to be a rumour.'  'That's right,' confirmed Terranova.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"'You've already received a present from Yennefer,' he uttered in a hoarse voice. 'Now you're getting one    from me.'  He struck once more. The sorcerer's head bounced up; blood spurted onto the Geralt's forehead and  cheeks. Geralt was slightly surprised - he had not felt any pain but had, no doubt, been injured in the  fight. It was his blood.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer

"'Don't you even dare,' said Yennefer, without turning around. 'I thought ...' She cleared her throat. 'I thought one of them might be from Geralt ...'  'If it was, I'd have given it to you.' The magician turned in her chair and sat facing her. 'Are you going to  be long washing?'  'I've finished.'  'Get up, please.'  Ciri obeyed. Yennefer smiled faintly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer

"I'm never going to be a magician nor  want to be one! I'm destined for Geralt ... I'm destined to be a Geralt! I've only come here for a short  period! I'm going back to Kaer Morhen soon ...'  'You are persistently staring at my neckline,' said Yennefer icily, narrowing her violet eyes a little.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"And I will answer. Sincerely.'  'Any question?'  'Any question.'  'As of now?'  'Yes. As of now.'  'What is there between you and Geralt, Lady Yennefer?'  Ciri almost fainted, horrified at her own impertinence, chilled by the silence which followed the question. The enchantress slowly approached her, placed her hands on her shoulders, looked her in the eyes from  up close - and deeply. 'Longing,' she answered gravely.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"About how she learned about the Law of Surprise and that fate had decreed her to be the  destiny of Geralt of Rivia, the white-haired Geralt. She recalled the war, her exile in the forests of  Transriver, her time among the druids of Angren and the time spent in the country. How Geralt had found  her there and taken her to Kaer Morhen, the Geralts' Keep, thus opening a new chapter in her short  life. One evening, of her own initiative, unasked, casually, joyfully and embellishing a great deal, she told the  enchantress about her first meeting with the Geralt in Brokilon Forest, amongst the dryads who had  abducted her and wanted to force her to stay and become one of them. 'Oh!' said Yennefer on listening to the story, 'I'd give a lot to see that - Geralt, I mean.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"The one before ... Because the following summer there was the war already ...'  'Aha. That means the dreams started after you met Geralt in Brokilon?'  She nodded. I'm not going to answer the next question, she decided. But Yennefer did not ask anything.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"There's a whole chapter on the subject.'  Silence. 'Lady Yennefer ...'  'Oh, hell. What is it now?'  'It's been so long, why isn't Geralt ... Why isn't he coming?'  'He's forgotten about you, no doubt, ugly one. He's found himself a prettier girl.'  'Oh, no!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yennefer
"Well, I made up this ballad. I don't know any more, I swear!'  Rience scowled at him. 'And where is this Geralt now?' he asked. 'This hired monster murderer, this poetic butcher who likes to  discuss destiny?'  'I told you, the last time I saw him-'    'I know what you said,' Rience interrupted. 'I listened carefully to what you said.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"But I warrant you know what it is.'  1 )andilion clenched his teeth with anger and despair. 'Well?' Rience made a sign to the reeking man. 'Where is the Geralt hiding? What is the place called?'  The poet remained silent. The rope tightened, twisting his hands painfully, and his feet left the ground.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience tried to force it out of me with  torture. But you know, Yennefer. You know where the Geralt is hiding.'  'I do.'  'And you know how to get there.'  'I know that too.'  'Don't you think he should be warned? Warned that the likes of Rience are looking for him and the little  girl? I would go, but I honestly don't know where it is ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience,  or something like that. He's got a red mark on his left cheek as if from a burn. Do you know anyone like  that?'  Geralt got up. 'Boatbug,' he said. 'I'm disembarking in Acorn Bay.'  'How's that?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"I've seen people wander to  the scaffolds over lesser trivialities. Why didn't you inform me about your ambush, Dandelion? Did I not  instruct you to keep me informed about all the Geralt's intentions?'  'I didn't know anything about Geralt's plans,' Dandelion lied with conviction. 'I told you that he went to  Temeria and Sodden to hunt down this Rience. I also told you that he had returned.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"I also told you that he had returned. I was convinced he  had given up. Rience had literally dissolved into thin air, the Geralt didn't find the slightest trail, and this if  you remember - I also told you-'  'You lied,' stated the spy coldly. 'The Geralt did find Rience's trail. In the form of corpses.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"His toga resembled a  professor's but did not look as if it had been presented by a senate. It looked more as if it had been  found on a rubbish heap. 'Your Geralt, however,' suddenly snarled the spy, 'underestimated Master Rience. He set a trap but demonstrating  a complete lack of common sense - banked on Rience troubling himself to come in  person. Rience, according to the Geralt's plan, was to feel safe.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience, according to the Geralt's plan, was to feel safe. Rience wasn't to smell a trap anywhere,  wasn't to spy Master Dijkstra's subordinates lying in wait for him. Because, on the Geralt's instructions,  Master Dandelion had not squealed to Master Dijkstra about the planned ambush. But according to the  instructions received, Master Dandelion was duty bound to do so. Master Dandelion had clear, explicit  instructions in this matter which he deigned to ignore.'  'I am not one of your subordinates.' The poet puffed up with pride.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
Rience has been  warned and won't be duped a second time. But I can't let anything like this happen in the future. That's  why I want to see the Geralt. Bring him to me. Stop wandering around town trying to lose my agents.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"They weren't Rience's  men.'  'That's not news to me,' said the poet casually. 'I'm sure they were a few scoundrels of the likes of which  there is no shortage in the Temerian Guards. Rience has been asking about the Geralt and no doubt  offering a nice sum for any news about him. It's obvious that the Geralt is very important to him. So a  few crafty dogs tried to grab Geralt, bury him in some cave and then sell him to Rience, dictating their  conditions and trying to bargain as much out of him as possible.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"So a  few crafty dogs tried to grab Geralt, bury him in some cave and then sell him to Rience, dictating their  conditions and trying to bargain as much out of him as possible. Because they would have got very little,  if anything at all, for mere information.'  'My congratulations on such perspicacity. The Geralt's, of course, not yours - it would never have  occurred to you. But the matter is more complex than you think. My colleagues, men belonging to King  Foltest's secret service, are also, as it turns out, interested in Master Rience.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"My colleagues, men belonging to King  Foltest's secret service, are also, as it turns out, interested in Master Rience. They saw through the plan  of those - as you called them - crafty dogs. It is they who boarded the barge, they who wanted to grab  the Geralt. Perhaps as bait for Rience, perhaps for a different end. At Acorn Bay, Dandelion, the Geralt  killed Temerian agents.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"I can pacify the Temerians. But not for nothing. Where has the Geralt gone,  Dandelion?'  'Novigrad,' the troubadour lied without thinking. 'He went to look for Rience there.'  A mistake, a mistake,' smiled the spy, pretending not to have caught the lie. 'You see what a shame it is  he didn't overcome his repulsion and get in touch with me.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience isn't in Novigrad. Whereas there's no end of Temerian agents there. Probably all waiting for the  Geralt. They've caught on to something I've known for a long time. Namely, that Geralt, the Geralt  from Rivia, can answer all kinds of questions if he's asked in the right manner.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Maybe he can save us time? Don't forget, Dijkstra,  our poet is mixed up to his ears in this affair and we've got him here but we haven't got the Geralt. Where is the child seen with Geralt in Kaedwen? The girl with ashen hair and green eyes? The one  Rience asked you about back in Temeria when he caught and tortured you?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"'What's this about, Dandelion?' The Geralt fastened the buckles on his boots. 'Go on.'  'Pack your bags,' he replied dryly. 'Your departure is imminent.'  'How imminent?'  'Exceptionally.'  'Shani ...' Geralt cleared his throat. 'Shani told me about the snoops following you. You lost them, I  understand?'  'You don't understand anything.'  'Rience?'  'Worse.'  'In that case I really don't understand ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Tretogor? Dijkstra?'  'You've guessed.'  'That's still no reason-'  'It's reason enough,' interrupted Dandelion. 'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt. They're after the girl and Yennefer. Dijkstra wants to know where they are.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Set the magicians to work and have them prepare a  telecommunication link with their point of contact in Redania. Let them pass on my verbal orders, which  must immediately be sent to Rience. The order is to run as follows: Rience is to stop pussyfooting around,  and to stop playing with the Geralt. Else it could end badly. No one toys with the Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"I know him,  Coehoorn. He is too clever to lead Rience to the Trail. I repeat, Rience is to organise the assassination  immediately, to take the Geralt out of the game at once. He's to kill him, and then disappear, bide his  time and await my orders. If he comes across the enchantress's trail before that he is to leave her alone.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"For a very long time.'  'You shouldn't have said that.' The Geralt smiled nastily, feeling the euphoria of battle aroused by the  elixir, reacting with adrenalin. 'Before you said that, you still had a chance to live. Now you don't.'  A powerful oscillation of his Geralt's medallion warned him of a sudden assault. He jumped aside and,  drawing his sword in a flash, deflected and annihilated the violent, paralysing wave of magical energy  directed at him with his rune-covered blade. Rience backed away, raised his arm to make a move but at  the last moment took fright.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience backed away, raised his arm to make a move but at  the last moment took fright. Not attempting a second spell, he swiftly retreated down the lane. The  Geralt could not run after him - the four men who thought they were concealed in the shadows threw  themselves at him. Swords flashed. They were professionals.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the  charlatan's house. Rience retreated into the depths of the lane, raising and spreading  both arms in front of him, a magical light already beginning to exude from them. Geralt grasped his sword  with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him. The sorcerer's nerves could not take it. Without completing his spell, he began to run away, yelling incomprehensibly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"The little street blazed with a bright light and on the dilapidated, sullied walls of a  house, flared the fiery oval of a portal. Rience threw himself towards it. Geralt jumped. He was furious. Toublanc Michelet groaned and curled up, clutching his riven belly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"He struggled  furiously, violently ripped the cloak from clasp to clasp and freed himself. Too late. Geralt spun him round by hitting him in the shoulder with his right hand, then immediately struck him in the  neck under the ear with his left. Rience reeled but did not fall. The Geralt, jumping softly, caught up with  him and forcefully dug his fist under his ribs.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"The Geralt, jumping softly, caught up with  him and forcefully dug his fist under his ribs. The sorcerer moaned and drooped over the fist. Geralt  grabbed him by the front of his doublet, spun him and threw him to the ground. Pressed down by the  Geralt's knee, Rience extended his arm and opened his mouth to cast a spell. Geralt clenched his fist  and thumped him from above.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"'Who sent you? Who hired you?'  Rience spat blood at him. The Geralt struck him yet again. 'Who?'  The fiery oval of the portal flared more strongly; the light emanating from it flooded the entire lane. The  Geralt felt the power throbbing from the oval, had felt it even before his medallion had begun to oscillate  violently, in warning.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Rience also felt the energy streaming from the portal, sensed help approaching. He yelled, struggling like  an enormous fish. Geralt buried his knees in the sorcerer's chest, raised his arm, forming the Sign of Aard  with his fingers, and aimed at the flaming portal. It was a mistake. No one emerged from the portal.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
Only power radiated from it and Rience had taken the power. From the sorcerer's outstretched fingers grew six-inch steel spikes. They dug into Geralt's chest and  shoulder with an audible crack. Energy exploded from the spikes. The Geralt threw himself backwards  in a convulsive leap.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"At least two of them. Rience attempted to rise but immediately collapsed to his knees again and began to struggle to the portal  on all fours. Geralt, catching his breath with difficulty, drew a stiletto from his boot. The sorcerer looked  back, sprung up and reeled. The Geralt was also reeling but he was quicker.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
The Geralt was also reeling but he was quicker. Rience looked back again  and screamed. Geralt gripped the knife. He was angry. Very angry.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience
"Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here! You can argue later!'  'You and your great cause ...' The Geralt, ignoring the troubadour, staggered forward. 'Your great  cause, Philippa, and your choice, is a wounded man, stabbed in cold blood once he told you what you  wanted to know, but what I wasn't to find out. Your great cause is Rience, whom you allowed to escape  so that he wouldn't by any chance reveal the name of his patron.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Rience

"What's more, she saw nothing of what she had  expected in those eyes. 'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek. And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen Geralts, Lambert, was  there with his usual ugly, mocking expression. Vesemir was not there.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"The sun is still high, even if it is obscured. You can still train.'  'Hey.' The Enchantress tossed her hair. 'Politeness comes cheap in Geralts' Keep now, I see. Ciri was  the first to greet me, and  brought me to the castle. She ought to keep me company-'  'She is undergoing training here, Merigold.' Lambert grimaced in a parody of a smile.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"Oh, Triss, old age is no joke. My bones ache so I want to howl. Will you help an old  man, child?'  'I will.' The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the Geralt  accompanying Vesemir. He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black  beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox. This was unusual; Geralts  were generally highly immune to infectious diseases.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"'You've finally got it! Go back and do it again. I want to make sure it  wasn't a fluke!'  'The sword,' Triss turned to the Geralts, 'looks sharp. The beam looks slippery and unstable. And  Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"They changed the subject at once. She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"You're right,  Lambert. But a woman has arrived, and the old order's collapsed; a time of great change has arrived. Come on, Ciri.'  The girl hesitated, looked at Geralt. Geralt nodded his agreement and smiled. Pleasantly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
with a safety de- A safety device. Lambert says I'm a sissy and a wimp but that's not true. Geralt told me my weight is distributed a little  differently because I'm a girl. I've simply got to practise more unless ... I wanted to ask you something.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"Understood?'  Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man. Lambert snorted  loudly. Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back. 'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"So let us call it advice. I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"You have goats here. Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"attributes. Do you understand what I'm saying?'  'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her  dress. Eskel cleared his throat and looked daggers at the young Geralt. 'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed  anything irreversible in her, I hope?'  'No.' She smiled. 'Fortunately, not.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"and suddenly something happens. A house might goes up in flames. Or sometimes, half a  town goes up.'  'You're exaggerating, Merigold.'  'Lambert.' Geralt released his medallion and rested his hands on the table. 'First, stop calling Triss   Merigold . She has asked you a number of times not to.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"Don't you think, boys, that the time has come for more truthful confessions? Hell, I repeat, I will keep  your secret. You have my word.'  Lambert glanced at Geralt; Geralt nodded in assent. The younger Geralt stood and took a large  rectangular crystal carafe and a smaller phial from a high shelf. He poured the contents of the  phial into the carafe, shook it several times and poured the transparent liquid into the chalices on the    table.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Lambert
"There used to be a beautiful  castle here. A long time ago.'  She did not reply, bowing her head low. The Geralt's mare, called Roach, snorted quietly, as if she too  wanted to reassure the girl. They immersed themselves in a dark abyss, in a long, unending black tunnel dotted with columns and  arcades. Roach stepped  confidently and willingly, ignoring the impenetrable darkness, and her horseshoes rang brightly against the  floor.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"'Who comes?' Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark. 'Geralt?'    'Yes, Eskel. It's me.'  'Come in.'  The Geralt dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into  her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind  completely. 'Wait here with Eskel,' he said. 'I'll take Roach to the stables.'  'Come into the light, laddie,' growled the man called Eskel.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"Maybe you should cast a spell on yourself?'  'I've tried. And this is the result. I can't concentrate because of this cramp ...'  'Don't cry.'  'Easy for you to say!'  The Geralt got up, pulled his saddle-bags from Roach's back and began rummaging through them. Triss  curled up, her face contracted and her lips twisted in a spasm of pain. 'Ciri ...'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Do you feel all right?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"dysentery. Or  paratyphoid.'  'Aren't you immune?'  Triss turned her head away without replying, bit her lip and curled up even tighter. The Geralt did not  pursue the question. Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle. Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"Next to him sat his brother Regan. She also saw Wenck  riding a horse, in the company of two bailiffs. Roach, Geralt's mare, tethered to the wagon, greeted her with a quiet neigh. She couldn't see her  chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun. No doubt they were at the rear, with the convoy's spare horses.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"You wanted to know, didn't you? So you've got the honest truth and faithful  history of a world where he who shatters the skulls of others most efficiently and swells women's bellies  fastest, reigns. And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"Coming straight at them, blocking the path, raced two horses dragging a harness, reins and a broken  shaft behind them. Ciri did not hold her chestnut back and shot past them at full speed, flakes of froth  skimming across her face. Behind her she heard Roach neigh and Geralt's curses as he was forced to a  halt. She tore around a bend in the path in to a large glade. The convoy was in flames.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering. Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"It was her knees. Paulie Dahlberg, keeping the elf charging at him at bay with his axe, dragged the wounded Wenck along  the ground. Roach flitted past, beside the wagon, and Geralt threw himself at the elf. He had lost his  headband and his hair streamed out behind him with his speed. Swords clashed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Roach
"There were rats here, too; they flitted under the walls, squeaked from  the dark abyss, from the branching passages, and skittered before the swaying circle of light thrown by  the torch. Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs. A gleam was visible below them.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert
"What's more, she saw nothing of what she had  expected in those eyes. 'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek.

"'To think I didn't believe that she really is a princess.'  'Have you understood, you idiots?' Vesemir cast his eye around. 'If she puts a dress on in the morning I  don't want to see any exercises ... Understood?'  Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man. Lambert snorted  loudly. Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert

"I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert
"'Senseless drivel.'  'Then I have no doubt' - she looked straight at him - 'that you understood each other perfectly well. Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert
"Geralt, a hand on his forehead, did not say a word. Vesemir nodded, from time to time throwing in  comments which amounted to little more than that 'in his day' everything had been better, more logical,  more honest and healthier. Eskel pretended to be polite, and neither smiled nor made eye contact, and  even managed, very occasionally, to be interested in some issue or question of little importance. Coen  yawned openly and looked at the ceiling, and Lambert did nothing to hide his disdain. They did not want to know anything, they cared nothing for  dilemmas which drove sleep from kings, wizards, rulers and leaders, or for the problems which made  councils, circles and gatherings tremble and buzz.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert
The lady magician knew a surprising amount about a Geralt's sword and 'dance'. She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep. She knew Vesemir and  Eskel. Although not Lambert and Coen. Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen.,Blood of Elves,Eskel,Lambert
"What's this gang of  fellows you're commanding, Yarpen?'  'I'm not the one in command. Allow me to introduce you. Forgive me, Wenck, for not doing so straight  away but me and my boys have known Geralt of Rivia for a long time - we've a fair number of shared  memories behind us. Geralt, this is Commissar Vilfrid Wenck, in the service of King Henselt of Ard  Carraigh, the merciful ruler of Kaedwen.'  Vilfrid Wenck was tall, taller than Geralt and near twice the dwarf's height. He wore an ordinary, simple  outfit like that worn by greeves, bailiffs or mounted messengers, but there was a sharpness in his  movements, a stiffness and sureness which the Geralt knew and could faultlessly recognise, even at  night, even in the meagre light of the campfire.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
"They could jeopardise our safety. King  Henselt, knowing this, empowered me to recruit volunteers to join our armed escort. Geralt? That would  solve your problem.'  The Geralt's silence lasted a long while, longer than Wenck's entire speech, interspersed though it had  been with regular pauses. 'No,' he said finally.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
"She couldn't see her  chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun. No doubt they were at the rear, with the convoy's spare horses. Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen. They were talking quietly, drinking beer from a  barrel perched between them. Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
"Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war. Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence. Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help. Geralt was surprised that the aid had to be quite so secretive, to which the  dwarf replied that was why the secret was a secret. Triss tossed in her sleep, shook the compress off and talked indistinctly to herself.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
"'The Squirrels are fighting for freedom. And although you're a dwarf,  you're King Henselt's special secret servant on a human leash.'  Yarpen snorted, wiped his nose on his sleeve and leaned out of the box to check that Wenck had not  ridden up too close. But the commissar was far away, engaged in conversation with Geralt. 'You've got pretty good hearing, girl, like a marmot.' He grinned broadly. 'You're also a bit too bright for  someone destined to give birth, cook and spin.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
'Yarpen?'  'Yes?'  'Who's right? The Squirrels or you? Geralt wants to be ... neutral. You serve King Henselt even though  you're a dwarf.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Henselt
"Demawend, ruler of Aedirn, sprawled in his armchair staring at the  tankard of beer resting on his belly. Foltest, the Lord of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam and Sodden, and  recently Senior Protector of Brugge, presented his noble profile to everyone by turning his head towards  the window. At the opposite side of the table sat Henselt, King of Kaedwen, running his small, piercing  eyes - glistening from a face as bearded as a brigand's - over the other participants of the council. Meve,  Queen of Lyria, toyed pensively with the enormous rubies in her necklace, occasionally twisting her  beautiful full lips into an ambiguous grimace. 'Let us not commit a mistake,' repeated Vizimir, 'because a mistake could cost us too much.",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"'I propose action.'  What sort of action?'  'What can we do?'  Silence fell again. The wind blustered, the shutters banged against the castle wall. 'Why,' said Meve suddenly, 'are you all looking at me?'  'We're admiring your beauty,' Henselt mumbled from the depths of his tankard. 'That too,' seconded Vizimir. 'Meve, we all know you can find  a solution to everything.",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"Not telling them that Cintra can only be reborn as a vassal country under your protectorship? You are proposing, to all of us, an attack on Cintra for your own gain? You have suborned Sodden and  Brugge for yourself, are sharpening your teeth on Verden and now you have caught a whiff of Cintra, is  that right?'  'Admit it, Foltest,' snapped Henselt. 'Is Meve right? Is that why you are inciting us to this affair?'  'Come on, leave it.' The ruler of Temeria furrowed his noble brow and bristled angrily.",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"Are your sons really more stupid? Damn it, I  thought it wasn't possible to get any more stupid ... Forgive me, Meve ...'  'It's nothing, Vizimir.'  'Who else has sons?'  'You do, Henselt.'  'My son is married!'  'And what is poison for? For the throne of Cintra, as someone here so wisely said, many would sacrifice  their personal happiness. It would be worth if!'  'I will not permit such insinuations!",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"The gale howled among the towers of Hagge castle. The kings grew silent. 'Vizimir, Foltest, Demawend, Henselt and Meve,' repeated the marshal. 'They met in a secret council in  Hagge Castle on the Pontar. They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round.",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round. 'After all, it was at Hagge, not forty years ago, that Virfuril  defeated Medell's armies, strengthened his control over the Pontar Valley and established today's  borders between Aedirn and Temeria. And today Demawend, Virfuril's son, invites Foltest, Medell's  son, to Hagge, summoning Vizimir of Tretogor, Henselt of Ard Carraigh and the merry widow Meve of  Lyria to complete the set. They are meeting now and holding council in secrecy. Can you guess what they  are discussing, Coehoorn?'  'I can,' the marshal replied succinctly.",Blood of Elves,Henselt,Meve
"'Grey-haired yet stupid!' snarled the little snot's mother, a richly attired noblewoman, pulling her offspring  away by the beaver collar of his cloak. 'Come here, Everett! I've told you so many times not to be  familiar with the passing rabble!'  Geralt sighed, gazing at the outline of islands and islets looming through the morning mist. The barge, as  ungainly as a tortoise, trudged along at an appropriate speed that being  the speed of a tortoise - dictated by the lazy Delta current. The passengers, mostly merchants and  peasants, were dozing on their baggage.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"'And the mist? It is surely not so  thick as to render navigation impossible; what do you think?'  The little boy in the feathered hat ran past them and leaned far out, trying, with his stick, to fish out a rat  bouncing against the boat. Geralt approached and tore the stick from him. 'Scram. Don't get near the side!'  'Muuuummyyyy!'  'Everett!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Don't get near the side!'  'Muuuummyyyy!'  'Everett! Come here immediately!'  The Master Tutor pulled himself up and glared at the Geralt with piercing eyes. 'It seems you really do believe we are in some danger?'  'Master Pitt,' said Geralt as calmly as he could, 'two weeks ago something pulled two people off the  deck of one of the Company's barges. In the mist. I don't know what it was.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"I'm working.'  'My daddy,' declared Everett, creeping up without a sound, 'is one of King Foltest's knights! And he's  got an even bigger moustache than you!'  'Scram, kid,' said Olsen, then sighed heavily. 'Got any vodka, Geralt?'  'No.'  'But I do.' The learned man from the Academy, pulling a flat skin from his bag, surprised them all. 'And I've got a snack,' boasted Boatbug looming up as if from nowhere. 'Smoked burbot!'  'And my daddy-'  'Scarper, little snot.'  They sat on coils of rope in the shade of the carts parked amidship,  sipping from the skin and devouring the burbot in turn.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Well, just imagine, the Temerian Guards have been enquiring about you. The customs officers there,  with whom I have a good understanding, told me. Something smells funny here, Geralt.'  'The water?' Linus Pitt was afraid, glancing nervously at the aqueduct and the great scientific success. 'That little snotrag?' Boatbug pointed to Everett who was still milling around nearby. 'I'm not talking about that.' The customs officer winced.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"'Move back!' he roared. 'Move back or I'll slash the brat's neck!'  'Evereeeeett!' howled the noblewoman. 'Curious methods,' said the Geralt slowly, 'you Temerian Guards use. Indeed, so curious that it makes it  hard to believe you're Guards.'  'Shut your face!' yelled the bald one, shaking Everett, who was squealing like a piglet. 'Stran, Vitek, get  him!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Give  her to me or I'll slaughter this little snot!'  'Slaughter him then,' drawled Olsen giving a sign to his men and pulling out his cutlass. 'Is he mine or  something? And when you've slaughtered him, we can talk.'  'Don't interfere!' Geralt threw his sword on the deck and, with a gesture, held back the customs officers  and Boatbug's sailors. 'I'm yours, liar-guard, sir. Let the boy go.'  'To the lighter!' The bald man retreated to the side of the barge without letting Everett go, and grabbed a  rope.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Everett plopped into the already-reddening water. Everybody - those on the barge and  those on the lighter - started to scream as if possessed. Geralt tore himself away from the two men trying to bind him. He thumped one in the chin then threw him  overboard. The other took a swing at the Geralt with an iron hook, but faltered and  drooped into Olsen's hands with a cutlass buried to the hilt in his ribs.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"No such animal exists!'  He emerged just by the Temerian lighter, miraculously avoiding the fishing spear which one of baldy's  men was jabbing at him. The Guard didn't have time to strike him again before he splashed into the water  with an arrow in his throat. Geralt, catching hold of the dropped spear, rebounded with his legs against  the side of the boat, dived into the seething whirlpool and forcefully jabbed at something, hoping it was  not Everett. 'It's impossible!' he heard the Master Tutor's cries. 'Such an animal can't exist!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Everett, stirring the water like a little dog, had caught hold of baldy's legs as he was  trying to climb on to the lighter by the ropes hanging down the side. The ropes gave way and both the  Guard and the boy disappeared with a gurgle under the surface of the water. Geralt threw himself in their  direction and dived. The fact that he almost immediately came across the little boy's beaver collar was  nothing but luck. He tore Everett from the entangled algae, swam out on his back and, kicking with his  legs, reached the barge.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"Leaning over the railings, the dwarf with the fox furs and Olsen  were firing their bows. Everett, wet and green with algae, his teeth clattering, sobbed in his mother's arms  explaining to everybody that he hadn't meanl to do it. 'Geralt!' Boatbug yelled at his ear, 'are you dead?'  'Damn it ...' The Geralt spat out seaweed. 'I'm too old for this sort of thing ... Too old ...'  Nearby, the dwarf released his bowstring and Olsen roared joyously.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"'May the water be light to him,' said Olsen. But he did not remove his hat. 'My daddy,' rattled Everett with his teeth, 'can swim faster than that man!'  'Take the child away,' growled the Geralt. The monster spread its claws, snapped its jaws. Linus Pitt grew pale and turned away.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Everett
"However, if you could ...'  He brought his lips closer to the girl's hair and took a while to whisper something. Shani's eyes opened  wide. 'A Geralt? A real Geralt?'  'Quiet, for the love of gods. Will you do that, Shani?'  'Of course.' The medical student smiled readily.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"But not this. 'Shani.' He shook his head. 'May the-'  'No comments, thank you very much.' The Geralt sat down on the bed. And Shani covered herself,  yanking the sheet right up to her upturned nose. 'Well, come in then.' Geralt reached for his trousers.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Because if it isn't I'm going to throw you straight back out through it.'  Dandelion clambered off the sill, knocking down the rest of the onions. He sat down, pulling the  high-backed, wooden chair closer with his foot. The Geralt gathered Shani's clothes and his own from  the floor. He looked abashed and dressed in silence. The medical student, hiding behind him, was  struggling with her shirt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"The medical student, hiding behind him, was  struggling with her shirt. The poet watched her insolently, searching in his mind for similes and rhymes for  the golden colour of her skin in the light of the oil lamp and the curves of her small breasts. 'What's this about, Dandelion?' The Geralt fastened the buckles on his boots. 'Go on.'  'Pack your bags,' he replied dryly. 'Your departure is imminent.'  'How imminent?'  'Exceptionally.'  'Shani ...' Geralt cleared his throat.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"A big grey owl glided down to the sill without a sound. Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes. 'Good evening,' she said coldly. 'Introduce me, Dandelion.'  'Geralt of Rivia. Shani of Medicine. And that owl which so craftily flew in my tracks is no owl.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"It's a shame we've only got one chair in here.'  'It's quite enough.' The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by  Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani. The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed. 'In principle, what I've come about is the sole concern of Geralt of Rivia,' Philippa began after a short  pause. 'I'm aware, however, that to ask anybody to leave would be tactless, and so ...'  'I can leave,' said Shani hesitantly. 'You can't,' muttered Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"- life is an endless train of surprises ... as  one of my friends says ... As our mutual friend says, Geralt. You're studying medicine, are you, Shani? What year?'  'Third,' grunted the girl.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"I hate flying in the rain. Is this it? This is Myhrman's house?'     'Yes,' confirmed Geralt. 'Listen, Shani, we'll try ...'  They bunched together and started whispering, concealed in the dark under the eaves of a hut's reed  roof. A strip of light fell on the water from the tavern on the opposite side of the canal.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the  charlatan's house. Rience retreated into the depths of the lane, raising and spreading  both arms in front of him, a magical light already beginning to exude from them. Geralt grasped his sword  with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him. The sorcerer's nerves could not take it. Without completing his spell, he began to run away, yelling incomprehensibly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane. And knows perfectly well what she's doing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Because I did this precisely so as not to  betray a cause which is greater than you can imagine. A great and important cause, so important that  minor matters have to be sacrificed for it without second thoughts, if faced with such a choice. Geralt,    damn it, we're nattering and you're standing in a pool of blood. Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here! You can argue later!'  'You and your great cause ...' The Geralt, ignoring the troubadour, staggered forward. 'Your great  cause, Philippa, and your choice, is a wounded man, stabbed in cold blood once he told you what you  wanted to know, but what I wasn't to find out. Your great cause is Rience, whom you allowed to escape  so that he wouldn't by any chance reveal the name of his patron.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Shani
"No one ever prayed in Kaer Morhen, I wonder why we have to here. No doubt because this is  a Temple. Geralt. Mother Nenneke has read and said I must not write Silly Things and write clearly without  mistakes. And about what I'm studying and that I feel well and healthy.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"I feel well and am healthy if  unfortunately Hungry, but Soone be Dinner. And Mother Nenneke also said write that prayer has never  harmed anybody yet, neither me nor, certainly, you. Geralt, I have some free time again, I will write therefore that I am studying. To read and write correct  Runes. History.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"Mother Nenneke read this and  praised me that it was correct. That I am obedient, she told me to write, and that you should not worry. Don't worry, Geralt. Again I have some time so I will write what happened. When we were feeding the turkey hens, I, Iola  and Katye, One Enormous Turkey attacked us, a red neck it had and was Terrible Horrible.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"But never mind, I will study. After all, you too studied in the Temple,  Mother Nenneke told me. And she  also told me that just any idiot can brandish a sword but a Geralt -girl must be wise. Geralt, you promised to come. Come.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"But never mind, I will study. After all, you too studied in the Temple,  Mother Nenneke told me. And she  also told me that just any idiot can brandish a sword but a Geralt -girl must be wise. Geralt, you promised to come. Come.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"If you are  gifted and want to, I can try to instil in you some elementary knowledge of magic.'  'What does  elementary  mean?'  'Basic'  They were alone in the large chamber next to the library in an unoccupied side wing of the building, which  Nenneke had allocated to the lady magician. Ciri knew that this chamber was used by guests. She knew  that Geralt, whenever he visited the Temple, stayed right here. 'Are you going to want to teach me?' She sat on the bed and skimmed her hand over the damask  eiderdown. 'Are you going to want to take me away from here?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"But in time her questions became more and more  concrete. Ciri had to reply and did so very unwillingly because every question the magician asked opened  a door in her memory which she had promised herself never to open, which she wanted to keep forever  locked. Ever since she had met Geralt in Sodden, she had believed she had begun 'another life', that the  other life - the one in Cintra - had been irrevocably wiped out. The Geralts in Kaer Morhen never  asked her about anything and, before coming to the temple, Geralt had even prevailed upon her not to  say a word to anyone about who she was. Nenneke, who, of course knew about everything, saw to it  that to the other priestesses and the novices Ciri was exceptionally ordinary, an illegitimate daughter of a  knight and a peasant woman, a child for whom there had been no place either in her father's castle or her  mother's cottage.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Nenneke
"The army is marching the  highways out of boredom? Don't twist things, Jarre. You visit the town and castle, you must know    something!'  'Why don't you ask Lady Yennefer about it?'  'Lady Yennefer has more important things to worry about!' Ciri spat, but then immediately had second  thoughts, smiled pleasantly and fluttered her eyelashes. 'Oh, Jarre, tell me, please! You're so clever!",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"Jarre! Stop  that immediately!'  The boy abruptly pulled his lips away from her hair and went as red as a beetroot. '1 do not wish you to do that to me!'  'Ciri, I '  'I came to you with a serious matter, as a wizard to a scholar,' she said icily and with dignity, in a tone of  voice which exactly copied that of Yennefer. 'So behave!'  The 'scholar' blushed an even deeper shade and had such a stupid expression on his face that the 'wizard'  could barely keep herself from laughing. He leaned over the map once more.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"How ...'  'I've got to go,' she repeated, getting to her feet and brushing the dust off her knees. 'Listen, Jarre. I'm  leaving with Lady Yennefer, on some very important matters. I don't know when we'll be back. I warn  you they are secret matters which concern only wizards, so don't ask any questions.'  Jarre also stood up.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"The magician put the comb aside but, lost in thought, kept gazing through the window at the swarms of  ravens and crows croaking horrifically as they flew east. On the table, next to the mirror and an  impressive array of bottled cosmetics, lay several letters. Ciri knew that Yennefer had been waiting for  them a long time and that the day on which they were to leave the Temple depended on her receiving  these letters. In spite of what she had told Jarre, the girl had no idea where and why they were leaving. But in those letters ...",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"Surely you've not forgotten  what we talked about?'  'No. I haven't.'  When you visit Jarre I hope there aren't any problems with your memory either?'  Ciri lowered her eyes, but only momentarily. Yennefer did not smile. 'Dry yourself and come here,' she said coolly. 'No splashing, please.'  Wrapped in a towel, Ciri sat down on the small chair at the magician's knees.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"Jarre reads various learned books and knows it all, but I think ...'  'It interests me, what you think, Ciri.'  'In Cintra ... That time ... Lady Yennefer, my grandmother was much cleverer than Jarre. King Eist  was clever, too. He sailed the seas, saw everything, even a narwhal and sea serpent, and I bet he also  saw many an analogy.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Jarre
"Triss rode closer, wanting to make sure this was, indeed, the Trail and not a tree  accidentally felled in a gale. But she spied a narrow, indistinct pathway disappearing into the woods. She  could not be mistaken - this was definitely the Trail, a path encircling the old castle of Kaer Morhen and  beset with obstacles, where Geralts trained to improve their running speeds and controlled breathing. The path was known as the Trail, but Triss knew young Geralts had given it their own name: The Killer. She clung to the horse's neck and slowly rode under the trunk.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"And the fast, light footsteps of someone running. She turned in her saddle, pulled on the reins and waited for the Geralt to run out onto the log. A Geralt did run out onto the log, flitted along it like an arrow without slowing down, without even using  his arms to aid his balance - running nimbly, fluently, with incredible grace. He flashed by, approaching  and disappearing amongst the trees without disturbing a single branch. Triss sighed loudly, shaking her  head in disbelief.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Beyond the Gullet, the Trail turned into the woods and led straight  to the fortress. If she did not catch the boy at the precipice, she might not see him at all. She had already  visited Kaer Morhen a few times, and knew she saw only what the Geralts wanted her to see. Triss was  not so naive as to be unaware that they wanted to show her only a tiny fraction of the things to be seen in  Kaer Morhen. After a few minutes riding along the stony trough of the stream she caught sight of the Gullet - a leap over  the gully created by two huge mossy rocks, overgrown with gnarled, stunted trees.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"She sat down and  carefully straightened her foot, swearing once more. 'Come here, little one, help me get up.'  'I'm not little.'  'If you say so. In that case, what are you?'  'A Geralt!'  'Ha! So, come here and help me get up, Geralt.'  The girl did not move from the spot. She shifted her weight from foot to foot, and her hands, in their  fingerless, woollen gloves, toyed with her sword belt as she glanced suspiciously at Triss.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'I'm not a bandit or outsider. I'm called Triss Merigold  and I'm going to Kaer Morhen. The Geralts know me. Don't gape at me. I respect your suspicion, but  be reasonable.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"She wanted a closer look at the girl. And to touch her. The green eyes of the little Geralt-girl betrayed no signs of mutation, and the touch of her little hand did  not produce the slight, pleasant tingling sensation so characteristic of Geralts. Although she ran the Killer  path with a sword slung across her back, the ashen-haired girl had not been subjected to the Trial of  Grasses or to Changes. Of that, Triss was certain.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"We'll go to Kaer  Morhen together.'  'I ought to run.' Ciri shook her head. 'It's not good to stop running because you get milk in your muscles. Geralt says-'  'Geralt is at the keep?'  Ciri frowned, pinched her lips together and shot a glance at the enchantress from beneath her ashen  fringe. Triss chuckled again. 'All right,' she said.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Shouldn't they?'  'They should,' the magician agreed calmly. 'I think so, too. But the Geralts treat this graveyard as a ... reminder.'  'Reminder of what?'  'Kaer Morhen,' Triss said as she guided the horse towards the shattered arcades, 'was assaulted. There  was a bloody battle here in which almost all the Geralts died.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri stood next to them, in an identical position. In  her ludicrous clothes, she looked very funny. 'Welcome to Kaer Morhern, Triss.'  'Greetings, Geralt.'  He had changed. He gave the impression of having aged. Triss knew that, biologically, this was  impossible - Geralts aged, certainly, but too slowly for an ordinary mortal, or a magician as young as  her, to notice the changes.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Triss knew that, biologically, this was  impossible - Geralts aged, certainly, but too slowly for an ordinary mortal, or a magician as young as  her, to notice the changes. But one glance was enough for her to realise that although mutation could hold  back the physical process of ageing, it did not alter the mental. Geralt's face, slashed by wrinkles, was the  best evidence of this. With a sense of deep sorrow Triss tore her gaze away from the white-haired  Geralt's eyes. Eyes which had evidently seen too much.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"I've not had many reasons to be happy of late and the feelings I experienced  on hearing that you lived cannot compare to any other. Except perhaps what I feel now when I look at  you.'  Triss felt something explode inside her. Her fear of meeting the white-haired Geralt, which had  accompanied her throughout her journey, had struggled within her with her hope of having such a  meeting. Followed by the sight of that tired, jaded face, those sick eyes which saw everything, cold and  calculating, which were unnaturally calm but yet so infused with emotion ... She threw her arms around his neck, instantly, without thinking.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"In order to muffle and restrain the cry her lips found his lips and  stuck to them. She trembled, pressing hard against him, her excitement building and increasing, forgetting  herself more and more. Geralt did not forget himself. 'Triss ... Please.'  'Oh, Geralt ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"So much ...'  'Triss.' He moved her away delicately. 'We're not alone ... They're coming.'  She glanced at the entrance and saw the shadows of the approaching Geralts only after some time,    heard their steps even later. Oh well, her hearing, which she considered very sensitive, could not compete  with that of a Geralt. 'Triss, my child!'  'Vesemir!'  Vesemir was really very old.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Oh, Triss, old age is no joke. My bones ache so I want to howl. Will you help an old  man, child?'  'I will.' The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the Geralt  accompanying Vesemir. He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black  beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox. This was unusual; Geralts  were generally highly immune to infectious diseases.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'Triss Merigold, Coen.' Geralt introduced them to each other. 'This is Coen's first winter with us. He  comes from the north, from Poviss.'  The young Geralt bowed. He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The white-haired Geralt remained silent, his face perfectly still; he did not  react with even the slightest quiver of his eyelids to Vesemir's unspoken request for support. 'It's not what you think.' The old man cleared his throat. 'Geralt brought her here last autumn. She has no  one apart from- Triss, how can one not believe in destiny when-'  'What has destiny to do with waving a sword around?'  'We are teaching her to fence,' Geralt said quietly, turning  towards her and looking her straight in the eyes. 'What else are we to teach her?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"As  prettily as she could. She did not want him to use that tone of voice. The Geralt shrugged. Triss, knowing him a little, immediately changed tactics and gave up the argument. She looked at Ciri again.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'You've finally got it! Go back and do it again. I want to make sure it  wasn't a fluke!'  'The sword,' Triss turned to the Geralts, 'looks sharp. The beam looks slippery and unstable. And  Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"It is.' Vesemir took a deep breath. 'Triss, you must be tired. And hungry?'  'I cannot deny it,' she sighed, giving up on trying to catch Geralt's eye. 'To be honest, I'm on my last legs. I spent last night  on the Trail in a shepherd's hut which was practically falling apart, buried in straw and sawdust.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Let it be the tower for  today, if appearances matter so much to you. I can sleep in the tower in the best of all the beds in Kaer  Morhen. Although I would prefer to sleep with Geralt in the worst. 'Let's go, Triss.'  'Let's go.'  The wind hammered against the shutters and ruffled the remains of the moth-eaten tapestries which had  been used to insulate the window. Triss lay in perfect darkness in the best bed in the whole of Kaer  Morhen.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
For what purpose? Vesemir's illness was just a pretext. Vesemir was a Geralt. The fact that he was also an old man did not  change the fact that many a youngster could envy him his health. If the old man had been stung by a  manticore or bitten by a werewolf Triss would have accepted that she had been summoned to aid him.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"If the old man had been stung by a  manticore or bitten by a werewolf Triss would have accepted that she had been summoned to aid him. But 'aching bones' was a joke. For an ache in his bones, not a very original complaint within the  horrendously cold walls of Kaer Morhen, Vesemir could have treated with a Geralts' elixir or - an  even simpler solution - with strong rye vodka, applied internally and externally in equal proportions. He  didn't need a magician, with her spells, filters and amulets. So who had summoned her?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"That was followed by a short-lived and entertaining fascination with the same sex, which  ended in the conclusion that soiling towels, passing wind and greediness were by no means exclusively  male attributes. Finally, like all but a few magicians, Triss moved to affairs with other wizards, which  proved sporadic and frustrating in their cold, technical and almost ritual course. Then Geralt of Rivia appeared. A Geralt leading a stormy life, and tied to her good friend Yennefer in a  strange, turbulent and almost violent relationship. Triss had watched them both and was jealous even though it seemed there was little to be jealous of.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"she had seduced the Geralt - with the help of a little magic. She had hit on a propitious moment, a  moment when he and Yennefer had scratched at each other's eyes yet again and had abruptly parted. Geralt had needed warmth, and had wanted to forget. No, Triss had not desired to take him away from Yennefer. As a matter of fact, her friend was more  important to her than he was.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Of course, thought Triss. They're feeding her those legendary cave saprophytes - a mountain plant  unknown to science - giving her the famous infusions of their mysterious herbs to drink. The girl is  developing quickly, is acquiring a Geralt's infernal fitness. Naturally, without the mutation, without the  risk, without the hormonal upheaval. But the magician must not know this.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Magic! Triss giggled. Ha, she thought, Geralts, I've got you! Ciri scared you just as she did me. She 'withdrew'  into a daydream, started to prophesy, gave out an aura which, after all, you can sense almost as well as I  can.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The wind howled, banged the shutter and swelled the tapestry. Triss rolled on to her back and, lost in  thought, started to bite her thumb nail. Geralt had not invited Yennefer. He had invited her. Does that mean ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'And don't wipe your  mouth with your sleeve! Finish your food; it's time for training. The days are getting shorter.'  'Geralt.' Triss finished her porridge. 'Ciri fell on the Trail yesterday. Nothing serious, but it was because  of that jester's outfit she wears.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Triss turned her eyes away. His smile was not for her. Ciri's little room was a faithful replica of the Geralts' quarters. It was, like theirs, devoid of almost all  fittings and furniture. There was practically nothing there beside a few planks nailed together to form a  bed, a stool and a trunk.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"If you can cast them ... Can you turn me into a boy?'  'No,' Triss replied in an icy tone. 'I can't.'  'Hmm ...' The little Geralt-girl was clearly troubled. 'But could you at least ...'  'At least what?'  'Could you do something so I don't have to ...' Ciri blushed. 'I'll whisper it in your ear.'  'Go on.' Triss leaned over.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"For almost half a year, having been taken in by a peasant family, she worked on the land and with  the livestock. Believe me, Triss, life has tried, seasoned and hardened her no less than good-for-nothings  like us, who were brought to Kaer Morhen from the highways. Ciri is no weaker than unwanted  bastards, like us, who were left with Geralts in taverns like kittens in a wicker basket. And her gender? What difference does that make?'  'You still ask?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Only that the  girl, not being like you, has her days! And bears them exceptionally badly! And you want her to tear her  lungs out on the Killer and some bloody windmills!'  Despite her outrage, Triss felt an exquisite satisfaction at the sight of the sheepish expressions of the  young Geralts, and Vesemir's jaw suddenly dropping open. 'You didn't even know.' She nodded in what was now a calm, concerned and gentle reproach. 'You're  pathetic guardians.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Maybe  her very first bleed happened here, in Kaer Morhen? And she cried to herself at night, unable to find any  sympathy, consolation or even understanding from anyone? Has any one of you given it any thought  whatsoever?'  'Stop it, Triss,' moaned Geralt quietly. 'That's enough. You've achieved what you wanted.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Not so as to demonstrate  her anger and annoyance but to break the pleasant, piercing vibration triggered by the Geralt's touch. Eskel emanated powerfully. More powerfully than Geralt. 'Triss,' he said, rubbing the hideous scar on his cheek with embarrassment, 'help us. We ask you.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Help  us, Triss.'  The enchantress looked him in the eye and pursed her lips. 'With what? What am I to help you with,  Eskel?'  Eskel rubbed his cheek again, looked at Geralt. The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ... that is, Miss Merigold, to ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Uncle Vesemir! Say yes!'  'I agree ...' Vesemir wheezed out. 'Of course, I agree ...'  'We are very happy.' Only now did Geralt take his hand from his forehead. 'We are extremely pleased,  Triss.'  The enchantress nodded slightly towards him and innocently fluttered her eyelashes, winding a chestnut  lock around her finger. Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Understood?'  Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man. Lambert snorted  loudly. Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back. 'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"So let us call it advice. I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"You have goats here. Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"attributes. Do you understand what I'm saying?'  'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her  dress. Eskel cleared his throat and looked daggers at the young Geralt. 'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed  anything irreversible in her, I hope?'  'No.' She smiled. 'Fortunately, not.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Like an elf. But you must not bury her alive here, in the middle of nowhere. She has to enter  normal life.'  'Her normal life went up in flames along with Cintra,' murmured Geralt, 'but regarding this, Triss, as usual  you're right. We've already thought about it. In spring I'm going to take her to the Temple school.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The one and only reason?'  'Yes,' Vesemir confirmed after a moment's silence. Triss breathed an imperceptible sigh of relief. For a moment, she was afraid that Geralt would be the one  to confirm it. The first snow fell the following day, fine snowflakes initially, but soon turning into a blizzard. It fell  throughout the night and, in the early morning, the walls of Kaer Morhen were drowned beneath a  snowdrift.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"It fell  throughout the night and, in the early morning, the walls of Kaer Morhen were drowned beneath a  snowdrift. There could be no question of running the Killer, especially since Ciri was still not feeling very  well. Triss suspected that the Geralts' accelerants might be the cause of the girl's menstrual problems. She could not be sure, however, knowing practically nothing about the drugs, and Ciri was, beyond  doubt, the only girl in the world to whom they had been administered. She did not share her suspicions  with the Geralts.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri was bored. She roamed the castle sleepily and finally, for lack of any other amusement, joined Coen  who was cleaning the stable, grooming the horses and repairing a harness. Geralt to the enchantress's rage disappeared somewhere and  appeared only towards evening, bearing a dead goat. Triss helped him skin his prey. Although she  sincerely detested the smell of meat and blood, she wanted to be near the Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss

"'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"But  as for loyalty ... I am loyal. And believe me, in this matter I can be loyal to both you and to the Chapter.'  'Such double loyalty' - Geralt looked her in the eyes for the first time that evening - 'is devilishly difficult to  manage. Rarely does it succeed, Triss.'  The enchantress turned her gaze on Ciri. The girl was sitting on a bearskin with Coen, tucked away in the  far corner of the hall, and both were busy playing a hand-slapping game.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"and suddenly something happens. A house might goes up in flames. Or sometimes, half a  town goes up.'  'You're exaggerating, Merigold.'  'Lambert.' Geralt released his medallion and rested his hands on the table. 'First, stop calling Triss   Merigold . She has asked you a number of times not to.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Hell, I repeat, I will keep  your secret. You have my word.'  Lambert glanced at Geralt; Geralt nodded in assent. The younger Geralt stood and took a large  rectangular crystal carafe and a smaller phial from a high shelf. He poured the contents of the  phial into the carafe, shook it several times and poured the transparent liquid into the chalices on the    table. 'Have a drink with us, Triss.'  'Is the truth so terrible,' she mocked, 'that we can't talk about it soberly?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'It was only the second time that she started talking sense,' she guessed. 'So there was a second time,  too. Also after she drank a drug because of your carelessness?'  'Triss.' Geralt raised his head. 'This is not the time for your childish spitefulness. It doesn't amuse us.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Foresaw the future. And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"As to the prophecy ... Was it specific? Detailed?'  'No.' Geralt looked her straight in the eyes. 'Confused. Don't ask about it, Triss.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Trisss! 'Triss!'  She opened her eyes, tossed her head on the pillow and moved her numb hands. 'Geralt?'  'I'm here. How are you feeling?'  She cast her eyes around. She was in her chamber, lying on the bed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty. 'I'm not important. I let you down.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The thing that wants to possess her might not be  able to reach her in the temple. And then you will ask Yennefer for help.'  'All right, Triss. Thank you.'  'Geralt?'  'Yes.'  'Ciri said something else, didn't she? Something only you heard. Tell me what it was.'  'No,' he protested and his voice quivered.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"And not only asking you.'  'You love her that much,' she stated, not asking. 'That much,' he admitted in a whisper after a long moment of silence. 'Geralt.'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Stay with me tonight.'  'Triss ...'  'Only stay.'  'All right.'  Not long after Midinvaerne the snow stopped falling. The frost came. Triss stayed with Ciri day and night.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Praise me, Geralt!'  'Well done, Ciri. Well done, girl.'  In the middle of February, the snow disappeared, whisked away by a warm wind blowing from the  south, from the pass. Whatever was happening in the world, the Geralts did not want to know. In the evenings, consistently and determinedly, Triss guided the long conversations held in the dark hall, lit  only by the bursts of flames in the great hearth, towards politics. The Geralts' reactions were always the  same.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"For them, only Kaer  Morhen existed, lost and lonely amongst the savage mountains. That evening Triss was irritable and restless - perhaps it was the wind howling along the great castle's  walls. And that evening they were all oddly excited - the Geralts, apart from Geralt, were unusually  talkative. Quite obviously, they only spoke of one thing -spring. About their approaching departure for  the Trail.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"But from what Triss has been telling us all     these evenings, it seems the conflict with Nilfgaard is more serious than that, not just some local little war. Is that right, Triss?'  'Even if it were the case,' said the magician spitefully, 'surely that suits you? A serious, bloody war will  lead to more deserted villages, more widowed women, simply hordes of orphaned children-'  'I can't understand your sarcasm.' Geralt took his hand away from his forehead. 'I really can't, Triss.'  'Nor I, my child.' Vesemir raised his head. 'What do you mean?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"For you it's an adventure. For me, it's a game  in which the stakes are survival. I'm involved in this game, and that's why your indifference and frivolity  hurt and insult me.'  Geralt sat up and looked at her. We're Geralts, Triss. Can't you understand that?'  What's there to understand?' The enchantress tossed her chestnut mane back.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"You know only too well what I mean. You want to hide your heads in the sand, that's your business. But coming from you, Geralt, it's a great surprise.'  'Triss.' The white-haired Geralt looked her straight in the eyes again. 'What do you expect from me? To  take an active part in the fight to save a world which is falling to pieces?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"I'm not  complaining about fate, Triss - this is plain, cold calculation. Statistics. No Geralt has yet died of old  age, lying in bed dictating his will. Not a single one. Ciri didn't surprise or frighten me.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The fact that someone can  experience normal love, normal hatred, normal fear, pain and regret, normal joy and normal sadness. That it is coolness, distance and indifference which are considered abnormal. Oh yes, Geralt, it annoys  you, it annoys you so much that you are starting to think about Kaer Morhen's vaults, about the  Laboratorium, the dusty demijohns full of mutagenic poisons-'  'Triss!' called Vesemir, gazing at Geralt's face, suddenly grown pale. But the enchantress refused to be  interrupted and spoke faster and faster, louder and louder. 'Who do you want to deceive, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"The fingers of her left hand were lightly  touching the pommel. On seeing them, the girl jumped, spun in a pirouette and landed softly in an identical but reverse mirror  position. 'Ciri,' said the Geralt, 'come down, please.'  It seemed she hadn't heard him. She did not move, not even a muscle. Triss, however, saw the reflection  of the moon, thrown across her face by the blade, glisten silver over a stream of tears.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri staggered, trying to find her balance. And failed. The Geralt jumped. Triss raised her hand, opening her mouth to utter a formula for levitation. She knew she couldn't do it in  time.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"It fell  accurately upon its victim, and its victim was Triss. Initially it seemed nasty but not too serious, resembling an ordinary stomach upset. Geralt and Ciri  discreetly tried to take no notice of the stops the enchantress's ailment necessitated. Triss, as pale as  death, beaded with sweat and painfully contorted, tried to continue riding for several hours longer, but at  about midday, and having spent an abnormally long time in the bushes by the road, she was no longer in  any condition to sit on a saddle. Ciri tried to help her but to no avail - the enchantress, unable to hold on  to the horse's mane, slid down her mount's flank and collapsed to the ground.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri tried to help her but to no avail - the enchantress, unable to hold on  to the horse's mane, slid down her mount's flank and collapsed to the ground. They picked her up and laid her on a cloak. Geralt unstrapped the saddle-bags without a word, found a  casket containing some magic elixirs, opened it and cursed. All the phials were identical and the  mysterious signs on the seals meant nothing to him. 'Which one, Triss?'    'None of them,' she moaned, with both hands on her belly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Maybe you should cast a spell on yourself?'  'I've tried. And this is the result. I can't concentrate because of this cramp ...'  'Don't cry.'  'Easy for you to say!'  The Geralt got up, pulled his saddle-bags from Roach's back and began rummaging through them. Triss  curled up, her face contracted and her lips twisted in a spasm of pain. 'Ciri ...'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Do you feel all right?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"dysentery. Or  paratyphoid.'  'Aren't you immune?'  Triss turned her head away without replying, bit her lip and curled up even tighter. The Geralt did not  pursue the question. Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle. Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding. They did not even manage a mile. The enchantress kept falling from Geralt's hands; she could not  stay in the saddle. Suddenly she started trembling convulsively, and  instantly burned with a fever. The gastritis had grown worse.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'Step away, please. Take care of Triss.'  Ciri huffed, unwilling, but obeyed. Geralt came closer. 'Elves,' he noted, not hiding his surprise. 'Elves,' the soldier confirmed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"There's no third way!'  The door of the hut squeaked and a soldier in a bloodied apron stood in the doorway. 'Forgive me for disturbing you,' he hawked. 'Which of you, noble sirs, be the one who brought this sick  woman here?'  'I did,' said the Geralt. 'What's happened?'  'Come with me, please.'  They went out into the courtyard. 'It bodes not well with her, sir,' said the soldier, indicating Triss.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'It bodes not well with her, sir,' said the soldier, indicating Triss. 'Firewater with pepper and saltpetre I  gave her - but it be no good. I don't really ...'  Geralt made no comment because there was nothing to say. The magician, doubled over, was clear  evidence of the fact that firewater with pepper and saltpetre was not something her stomach could  tolerate. 'It could be some plague.' The soldier frowned.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"It's too orderly, the  wagons are all the same, all covered ... A royal bailiff's, no doubt. I allowed them to cross the bridge  because they are following the Trail south, probably towards the fords on the Lixela.'  'Hmmm ...' The Geralt considered this, looking at Triss. 'That would be on my way. But will I find help  there?'  'Maybe yes,' the knight said coldly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Well, all right. I'll rummage through the bags. I used to have some good medicine for the runs,  maybe there's still a little left.'  'Ciri,' muttered the Geralt, passing her a sheepskin unstrapped from the horse, 'go to sleep, you're  barely on your feet. No, not in the wagon. We'll put Triss in the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"You feel how warm it is  here? A campfire's burning and a dwarf is just going to bring some medicine for ... For your stomach.'  'Geralt,' sobbed Triss, trying to disentangle herself from the blankets. No ... no magic elixirs, remember .",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Crushed garlic and  bitter salt has no right to slink, even if it's a hundred years old.'  'It's foul, uugghh. Triss won't eat that!'  'We'll use my grandmother's method. You squeeze her nose and I'll shove the pellets in.'  'Yarpen,' Geralt hissed, emerging abruptly from the darkness     with the magician in his arms. 'Watch out or I'll shove something down you.'  'It's medicine!' The dwarf took offence. 'It helps!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Mould, garlic ...'  'Yes,' moaned Triss weakly from the depths of her cocoon. 'It's true ... Geralt, it really ought to help . . .'  'See?' Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who  swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
".'  'See?' Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who  swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression. 'A wise magician. Knows what's good for her.'  'What are you saying, Triss?' The Geralt leaned over. 'Ah, I see. Yarpen, do you have any angelica?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"special.'  'So what are you transporting?'  'Salt fish,' said Yarpen casually, and proceeded to embellish his lie without batting an eyelid. 'Fodder,  tools, harnesses, various odds and ends for the army. Wenck is a quartermaster to the king's army.'  'If he's quartermaster then I'm a druid,' smiled Geralt. 'But that's your affair - I'm not in the habit of  poking my nose into other people's secrets. But you can see the state Triss is in.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Of course he  has to bear you in mind.'  'Who is this Triss to you?'  'What difference does it make in this situation?'  'In this situation none. I asked out of an inappropriate curiosity born of the desire to start new rumours  going around the inns. But be that as it may, you're mighty attracted to this enchantress, Geralt.'  The Geralt smiled sadly. 'And the girl?' Yarpen indicated Ciri with his head as she wriggled under the sheepskin. 'Yours?'  'Mine,' he replied without thinking.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'Mine, Zigrin.'  The dawn was grey, wet, and smelled of night rain and morning mist. Ciri felt she had slept no more than  a few minutes, as though she had been woken up the very minute she lay her head down on the sacks  heaped on the wagon. Geralt was just settling Triss down next to her, having brought her in from another enforced expedition  into the woods. The rugs cocooning the enchantress sparkled with dew. Geralt had dark circles under his  eyes.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"How is she?'  'Better,' moaned the magician. 'Better, but ... Listen, Geralt ... I'd like to  'Yes?' The Geralt leaned over but Triss was already asleep. He straightened himself, stretched.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Next to him sat his brother Regan. She also saw Wenck  riding a horse, in the company of two bailiffs. Roach, Geralt's mare, tethered to the wagon, greeted her with a quiet neigh. She couldn't see her  chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun. No doubt they were at the rear, with the convoy's spare horses.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war. Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence. Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help. Geralt was surprised that the aid had to be quite so secretive, to which the  dwarf replied that was why the secret was a secret. Triss tossed in her sleep, shook the compress off and talked indistinctly to herself.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"You wanted to know, didn't you? So you've got the honest truth and faithful  history of a world where he who shatters the skulls of others most efficiently and swells women's bellies  fastest, reigns. And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"His wife once told him to wash, and  Schrader went and died soon afterwards.'  'Because a rabid dog bit him.'  'If he hadn't washed, the dog wouldn't have bitten him.'  'I think,' said Ciri, checking the temperature of the water in the cauldron with her finger, 'it's excessive to  wash every day too. But Triss asked for it - she even started crying once ... So Geralt and I-'  'We know.' The elder Dahlberg nodded. 'But that a Geralt should ... I'm constantly amazed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Hey,  Zigrin, if you had a woman would you wash her and comb her hair? Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"I know you're strong but let me - I'll carry it.'  Geralt was already waiting for them; they could see his white hair through the gap in the canvas covering  the wagon from afar. The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own. They coped exceptionally well - he supported the  enchantress in his arms, Ciri washed and dried her. Only one thing had started to surprise and annoy Ciri    -Triss, in her opinion, snuggled up to Geralt too tightly. This time she was even trying to kiss him. Geralt indicated the magician's saddle-bags with his head.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Ciri understood immediately because this, too,  was part of the ritual Triss always demanded to have her hair combed. She found the comb and knelt  down beside her. Triss, lowering her head towards her, put her arms around the Geralt. In Ciri's  opinion, definitely a little too tightly. 'Oh, Geralt,' she sobbed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"'Wenck ... Paulie ...'  'What?'  'Triss!' she shouted with a piercing voice which was not hers, shuddered fiercely and wiped her face with  her arm. 'Quick, Geralt! We've got to help! To the horses, Geralt!'  'Ciri!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Eh, Dandelion? What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Triss
"Well,  but it's polite to introduce oneself. I'm called Yarpen Zigrin. And what are you called, little goose?'  'Something other than Little Goose,' snarled Ciri with a gleam in her eyes. The dwarf chuckled and bared his teeth. 'Ah.' He bowed with exaggeration.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"I fall at your feet. What is the young lady's name, if it's no secret?'  'It's no secret. I'm Ciri.'  'Ciri. Aha. And who is the young lady?'  'That,' Ciri turned her nose up proudly, 'is a secret.'  Yarpen snorted again.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"If the young lady will deign to forgive me, I've  brought the medicine and a little food. Will the young lady accept it or will she send the old boor, Yarpen  Zigrin, away?'  'I'm sorry ... Ciri had second thoughts and lowered her head. 'Triss really does need help, Master ... Zigrin.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"We'll roll some pellets according to my grandmother's recipe. No  disease sitting in the guts will resist these kernels.'  He unwrapped the bundle, extracted something shaped like a piece of turf and a small clay vessel. Ciri  approached, curious. 'You should know, Ciri,' said Yarpen, 'that my grandmother knew her medicine like nobody's business. Unfortunately, she believed that the source of most disease is idleness, and idleness is best cured through  the application of a stick.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"I've brought you some water and a little food-'  'Thank you. But they both need rest above all. Ciri, lie down.'  'I'll just make up a compress for Triss-'  'I'll do it myself. Yarpen, I'd like to talk to you.'  'Come to the fire. We'll broach a barrel-'  'I want to talk to you.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"I asked out of an inappropriate curiosity born of the desire to start new rumours  going around the inns. But be that as it may, you're mighty attracted to this enchantress, Geralt.'  The Geralt smiled sadly. 'And the girl?' Yarpen indicated Ciri with his head as she wriggled under the sheepskin. 'Yours?'  'Mine,' he replied without thinking. 'Mine, Zigrin.'  The dawn was grey, wet, and smelled of night rain and morning mist.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"'Sleep while you can. Rest.'  He jumped down off the wagon. Ciri heard the sound of the camp packing up - horses stamping,  harnesses ringing, poles squeaking, swingle-trees grating, and talking and cursing. And then, nearby,  Yarpen Zigrin's hoarse voice and the calm voice of the tall man called Wenck. And the cold voice of  Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"But I will  not enter the king's service as a soldier. Please don't count on my sword. I have no intention of killing  those, as you call them, evil creatures on the order of other creatures whom I do not consider to be any  better.'  Ciri heard Yarpen Zigrin hiss loudly and cough into his rolled-up sleeve. Wenck stared at the Geralt  calmly. 'I see,' he stated dryly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"'That pleases me,' he said after a normal pause. 'In taking Lady Merigold aboard a wagon in my convoy I  take on the responsibility lor her health, comfort and safety. Zigrin, give the command to march out.'  'Wenck.'  'Yes, Geralt?'  'Thank you.'  The commissar bowed his head, a bit more deeply and politely, it seemed to Ciri, than the usual,  perfunctory politeness required. Yarpen Zigrin ran the length of the column, giving orders and instructions loudly, after which he  clambered onto the coachman's box, shouted and whipped the horses with the reins. The wagon jolted  and rattled along the forest trail.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen. They were talking quietly, drinking beer from a  barrel perched between them. Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war. Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence. Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"She demanded that  someone called Kevyn kept his hands to himself, and immediately after that declared that destiny cannot  be avoided. Finally, having stated that everyone, absolutely everyone, is a mutant to a certain degree, she  fell into a peaceful sleep. Ciri also felt sleepy but was brought to her senses by Yarpen's chuckle, as he reminded Geralt of their  past adventures. This one concerned a hunt for a golden dragon who instead of allowing itself to be  hunted down had counted the hunters' bones and then eaten  a cobbler called Goatmuncher. Ciri began to listen with greater interest.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"'I came across her at the market in Gors Velen,' he recounted. 'She barely noticed me - she spat like a  she-cat and insulted my deceased mother horribly. I fled for all I was worth, but she shouted after me  that she'd catch up with me one day and make grass grow out of my arse.'  Ciri giggled, imagining Yarpen with the grass. Geralt grunted something about women and their impulsive  natures - which the dwarf considered far too mild a description for maliciousness, obstinacy and  vindictiveness. Geralt did not take up the subject and Ciri fell into dozing once more.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"'Bloody hell, if you'd ridden over  that the axle would be done for, and the wheels shattered to hell. Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins. 'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf. 'As you can see,  it's better to have a Geralt-girl on your wagon than to travel alone. I warned you just in time.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Who are these Scoia'tael anyway? These ... Squirrels?'  'Ciri,' Yarpen tussled his beard violently, 'these aren't matters for the minds of little girls.'  'Aha, now you're angry at me. I'm not little at all. I heard what the soldiers in the fort said about the  Squirrels.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon. 'But I didn't  want to ... interrupt this interesting conversation.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Triss wants to wash.'  'Go ahead,' agreed Yarpen Zigrin. 'Xavier, take the spit off the fire, our hare's had enough. Hand me the  cauldron, Ciri. Oh, look at you, it's full to the brim! Did you lug this great weight from the stream by  yourself?'  'I'm strong.'  The elder of the Dahlberg brothers burst out laughing.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"She's like a leather belt: thin, but it can't be torn apart in your hands. And if you were to hang  yourself on it, it would bear your weight, too.'  No one laughed. Ciri squatted next to the dwarves sprawled around the fire. This time Yarpen Zigrin and  his four 'boys' had lit their own fire at the camp because they did not intend to share the hare which  Xavier Moran had shot. For them alone there was just enough for one, at most two, mouthfuls each.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil. We'll infuse some more saffron and poppy seeds for the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"We'll turn them into a fishing-trap.'  'Why mine?'  'Pull them off, at the double, or I'll wallop you, snothead! Didn't mother say you have to listen to me?'  'Hurry up if you want to go fishing because dusk is just round the corner,' said Yarpen. 'Ciri, is the water  hot yet? Leave it, leave  it, you'll burn yourself and get dirty from the cauldron. I know you're strong but let me - I'll carry it.'  Geralt was already waiting for them; they could see his white hair through the gap in the canvas covering  the wagon from afar.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her. They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her. He did not need to lean over in  order to do so, as Geralt did.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"To hell with that! It's better to die than to live in the knowledge that you've done  something that needs forgiveness.'  Again he fell quiet. Ciri did not ask the questions pressing to her lips. She instinctively felt she should not. 'We have to live next to each other,' Yarpen continued.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Damn it all, it took a hundred years  but, somehow or other, we managed to live a common life, next to each other, together. We managed to  partially convince humans that we're not so very different-'  'We're not different at all, Yarpen.'  The dwarf turned abruptly. 'We're not different at all,' repeated Ciri. 'After all, you think and feel like Geralt. And like ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"During the pogrom.'  *  'Riders!' shouted one of Wenck's advance guards. 'Riders ahead!'  The commissar trotted up to Yarpen's wagon and Geralt approached from the other side. 'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely. 'Get off the box and get in the back! Stay with Triss.'  'I can't see anything from there!'  'Don't argue!' growled Yarpen.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Cloaks and beaver hats can be pretty  quick to change owners.'  The riders approached swiftly. There were about ten of them. Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note. Two felled birches -no problem. A heap of branches nothing  the wagons couldn't pass.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Geralt looked around, alert. He did not allow her to ride independently; he did not give her the chestnut's  reins; he led the horse himself. 'Ciri,' he said suddenly. 'Not a word about what we saw. Not to Yarpen, not to Wenck.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"From thickets, flaming arrows flew towards the wagons like fire birds,  perforating the canvas and digging into the boards. The Scoia'tael attacked with war-cries and yells. Ciri, ignoring Geralt's shouts from behind her, directed her horse straight at the first two wagons brought  to the fore. One was lying on its side and Yarpen Zigrin, axe in one hand, crossbow in the other, stood  next to it. At his feet, motionless, with her blue dress hitched halfway up her thighs, lay ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Ciri caught one lightly with her stirrup. She heard  a sharp buzz, her  steed struggled, whinnied and threw itself to the side. Ciri saw an arrow dug deep, just below the withers,  right by her thigh. She tore her feet from the stirrups, jumped up, squatted in the saddle, bounced off  strongly and leaped. She fell softly on the body of the overturned wagon, used her hands to balance herself and jumped again,  landing with bent knees next to Yarpen who was roaring and brandishing his axe.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and  started to drag her towards the overturned wagon. The enchantress moaned, holding her head just above  the ear. Right by Ciri's side, hooves suddenly clattered and horses snorted - two elves, brandishing their  swords, were pressing the madly fighting Yarpen hard. The dwarf spun like a top and agilely deflected  the blows directed against him with his axe. Ciri heard curses, grunts and the whining clang of metal.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"'Jump!' yelled Yarpen, shouting over the noise. 'Jump. Yannick!'  Ciri saw Geralt catch up with the speeding wagon and with a short, spare slash of his sword swipe one of  the elves from his saddle while Wenck, riding up on the opposite side, hewed at the other, the elf  shooting the horses. Yannick threw the reins down and jumped off - straight under the third Scoia'tael's  horse. The elf stood in his stirrups and slashed at him with his sword.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"The dwarf fell. At that moment the  flaming wagon crashed into those  still fighting, parting and scattering them. Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering. Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons. The fighters were suddenly parted by Regan's span as he struggled in the coachman's box with a halfling  wearing a lynx fur hat.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Go round!'  The wagon turned and descended on the elves again, parting them. One of them sprung up, grabbed the  right lead-horse by the halter but couldn't stop him; the impetus threw him under the hooves and wheels. Ciri heard an excruciating scream. Another elf, galloping next to them, gave a backhanded swipe with his sword. Yarpen ducked, the blade  rang against the hoop supporting the canvas and the momentum carried the elf forward.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"The blade of the axe whirred  and fell, slicing into the collar-bone with a hideous crunch. Paulie fell instantly, without a moan; it looked  as if the force of the blow had broken both his knees. Ciri screamed. Yarpen Zigrin leaped from the wagon. The black-bearded dwarf spun and cut.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Yarpen avoided the blow  with an agile half-turn dodge, grunted and struck ferociously, chopping in to black-beard -throat, jaw and  face, right up to the nose. The Scoia'tael bent back and collapsed, bleeding, pounding his hands against  the ground and tearing at the earth with his heels. 'Geraaaallllttt!' screamed Ciri, feeling something move behind her. Sensing death behind her. There was only a hazy shape, caught in a turn, a move and a flash but the girl - like lightning - reacted  with a diagonal parry and feint taught her in Kaer Morhen.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Triss is alive.'  'How is she?'  'She hit her head falling out of the wagon when Yarpen tried to rescue it. But she's fine now. Treating the  wounded.'  Ciri cast her eyes around. Amidst the smoke from the last wagons, burning out, silhouettes of armed men  flickered. And all around lay chests and barrels.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Hey, quick now, bring the stretcher! Stretcher!'  'No need,' the magician said hollowly, gazing at Wenck's lips where no more bubbles appeared. Ciri  turned away and pressed her face to Geralt's side. Fredegard drew himself up. Yarpen Zigrin did not look at him.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Sorceresses are not our sort of company.'  'Of course they aren't!' yelled Ciri and threw the basket of grain on the ground. 'Chickens are your sort  of company!'     The novices turned up their noses and left, passing through the hoard of cackling fowl. Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand. Then  she added a few words she had heard Yarpen Zigrin use, the meanings of which were a total mystery to  her. With a kick, she dispersed the chickens swarming towards the scattered grain, picked up the basket,  turned it upside down, then twirled in a Geralt's pirouette and threw the basket like a discus over the  reed roof of the henhouse.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yarpen
"Boys! Over here! You remember my boys, Geralt? This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and  here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.'    Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically  square in their thick quilted jerkins. 'There were six of you,' one by one he squeezed the hard, gnarled hands offered him, 'if I remember  correctly.'  'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins. 'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf. 'As you can see,  it's better to have a Geralt-girl on your wagon than to travel alone. I warned you just in time. But if you'd  been in the middle of pissing from the box and ridden onto that log, well, well.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"Hey,  Zigrin, if you had a woman would you wash her and comb her hair? Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"Ha, she thought, looking around, the safety of the entire  convoy depends on me now. They're all waiting impatiently for me to return and report: the way is clear  and passable, I didn't see anyone - there are no traces of wheels or hooves. I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"'Wenck ... Paulie ...'  'What?'  'Triss!' she shouted with a piercing voice which was not hers, shuddered fiercely and wiped her face with  her arm. 'Quick, Geralt! We've got to help! To the horses, Geralt!'  'Ciri!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere.

Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"It was her knees. Paulie Dahlberg, keeping the elf charging at him at bay with his axe, dragged the wounded Wenck along  the ground. Roach flitted past, beside the wagon, and Geralt threw himself at the elf. He had lost his  headband and his hair streamed out behind him with his speed. Swords clashed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Paulie
"I'm closing the inner gates to stop the heat  escaping.'  They walked along the corridor. There were rats here, too; they flitted under the walls, squeaked from  the dark abyss, from the branching passages, and skittered before the swaying circle of light thrown by  the torch. Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs. A gleam was visible below them. Ciri heard voices,  detected the smell of smoke. The hall was enormous, and flooded with light from a huge hearth roaring with flames which were being  sucked up into the heart of the chimney. The centre of the hall was taken up by an enormous, heavy  table.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"You can still train.'  'Hey.' The Enchantress tossed her hair. 'Politeness comes cheap in Geralts' Keep now, I see. Ciri was  the first to greet me, and  brought me to the castle. She ought to keep me company-'  'She is undergoing training here, Merigold.' Lambert grimaced in a parody of a smile. He always called  her that: 'Merigold', without giving her a title or a name.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm. 'A stable is no place to welcome a guest, but I  couldn't wait to see you.'  In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's  instructions. Deftly balancing on a beam hanging on chains, she was attacking - with her sword -a leather  sack bound with straps to make it resemble a human torso. Triss stopped to watch.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"And  Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting. Aren't you afraid of an unfortunate  accident? Or maybe you're relying on destiny to protect the child against it?'  'Ciri practised for nearly six months without a sword,' said Coen. 'She knows how to move. And we are  keeping an eye on her because-'  'Because this is her home,' finished Geralt quietly but firmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well. They had drunk cider, but the girl had been given water and was clearly both astonished and  revolted by it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"'The days are, indeed, getting shorter,' she continued, not waiting for a comment. 'But we're going to  make today shorter still. Ciri, have you finished? Come with me, if you please. We shall make some vital  adjustments to your uniform.'  'She's been running around in this for a year, Merigold,' said Lambert angrily.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"You're right,  Lambert. But a woman has arrived, and the old order's collapsed; a time of great change has arrived. Come on, Ciri.'  The girl hesitated, looked at Geralt. Geralt nodded his agreement and smiled. Pleasantly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly. At that moment, the door creaked open and Ciri entered the hall. Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag. Another present from the enchantress gleamed around the girl's neck - a little black viper made of  lacquered leather with a ruby eye and gold clasp. Ciri stopped in front of Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised. That was sensible, responsible and humane.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"She is  not so remarkable as to make us fall on our knees and raise our eyes to the heavens. Is there a lack of  female warriors roaming the world? I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish. Only after-'  He broke off.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"Although not Lambert and Coen. Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen. Ciri guessed why - when they spoke of the Keep - the eyes of the  enchantress grew warm, lost their angry gleam and their cold, indifferent, wise depth. If the words had  befitted Yennefer's person, Ciri would have called her dreamy, lost in memories. Ciri could guess the reason.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Lambert
"'Who comes?' Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark. 'Geralt?'    'Yes, Eskel. It's me.'  'Come in.'  The Geralt dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into  her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind  completely. 'Wait here with Eskel,' he said. 'I'll take Roach to the stables.'  'Come into the light, laddie,' growled the man called Eskel.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"I can't concentrate because of this cramp ...'  'Don't cry.'  'Easy for you to say!'  The Geralt got up, pulled his saddle-bags from Roach's back and began rummaging through them. Triss  curled up, her face contracted and her lips twisted in a spasm of pain. 'Ciri ...'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Do you feel all right? No ... unusual sensations?'  The girl shook her head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"The Geralt did not  pursue the question. Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle. Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding. They did not even manage a mile. The enchantress kept falling from Geralt's hands; she could not  stay in the saddle.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon. 'But I didn't  want to ... interrupt this interesting conversation.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"She heard screaming in the  distance, and smelt smoke. Coming straight at them, blocking the path, raced two horses dragging a harness, reins and a broken  shaft behind them. Ciri did not hold her chestnut back and shot past them at full speed, flakes of froth  skimming across her face. Behind her she heard Roach neigh and Geralt's curses as he was forced to a  halt. She tore around a bend in the path in to a large glade.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Roach
"Over here! You remember my boys, Geralt? This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and  here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.'    Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically  square in their thick quilted jerkins. 'There were six of you,' one by one he squeezed the hard, gnarled hands offered him, 'if I remember  correctly.'  'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin. 'There were six of us, indeed.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"The  wagon she was in was at the vanguard of the convoy. The one following them was being driven by a  dwarf with a red kerchief tied around his neck. From conversations between the dwarves, she had  gathered that his name was Paulie Dahlberg. Next to him sat his brother Regan. She also saw Wenck  riding a horse, in the company of two bailiffs.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"But they're sick or something, those fish. They've got a rash. Black and red  spots-'  'Trout!' roared Paulie, spitting crumbs of husk. 'Well, boys, to the stream double-quick! Regan!",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"Cloaks and beaver hats can be pretty  quick to change owners.'  The riders approached swiftly. There were about ten of them. Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"She tore her feet from the stirrups, jumped up, squatted in the saddle, bounced off  strongly and leaped. She fell softly on the body of the overturned wagon, used her hands to balance herself and jumped again,  landing with bent knees next to Yarpen who was roaring and brandishing his axe. Next to them, on the  second wagon, Paulie Dahlberg was fighting while Regan, leaning back and bracing his legs against the  board, was struggling to hold on to the harnessed horses. They neighed wildly, stamped their hooves and  yanked at the shaft in fear of the fire devouring the canvas. She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and  started to drag her towards the overturned wagon.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"And the  dwarf with his black, plaited beard, glistening with dried blood. And next to them ... 'Paulie!' sobbed Regan Dahlberg, holding his brother's head on his knees. 'Paulie! Why?'  No one said anything.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Regan
"'What  legend? What imaginative creation? You may not know him, but I know Geralt of Rivia. I saw him with  my own eyes in Wyzima, when he broke the spell on King Foltest's daughter. And I met him again later  on the Merchants' Trail, where, at Gildia's request, he slew a ferocious griffin which was preying on the  caravans and thus saved the lives of many good people.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest

"Grafitti on the wall of the Faculty of Law, University of Oxenfurt   CHAPTER FIVE   'Did you say something?'  The boy sniffed and pushed his over-sized velvet hat, a pheasant's feather hanging rakishly to the side,  back from his forehead. 'Are you a knight?' he repeated, gazing at Geralt with wide eyes as blue as the sky. 'No,' replied the Geralt, surprised that he felt like answering. 'I'm not.'     'But you've got a sword! My daddy's one of King Foltest's knights.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"My daddy's one of King Foltest's knights. He's got a sword, too. Bigger than  yours!'  Geralt leaned his elbows on the railing and spat into the water eddying at the barge's wake. 'You carry it on your back,' the little snot persisted. The hat slipped down over his eyes again.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"That's why the customs officers are  so keen. If too many Nilfgaardian goods were to cross the border, the Redanian economy would  collapse. Redania has practically no manufactories and the craftsmen wouldn't be able to cope with  competition.'  'In a nutshell,' smiled Geralt, 'Nilfgaard is slowly taking over with  its goods and gold that which it couldn't take with arms. Isn't Temeria defending itself? Hasn't Foltest  blocked his southern borders?'  'How?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"I'm working.'  'My daddy,' declared Everett, creeping up without a sound, 'is one of King Foltest's knights! And he's  got an even bigger moustache than you!'  'Scram, kid,' said Olsen, then sighed heavily. 'Got any vodka, Geralt?'  'No.'  'But I do.' The learned man from the Academy, pulling a flat skin from his bag, surprised them all. 'And I've got a snack,' boasted Boatbug looming up as if from nowhere. 'Smoked burbot!'  'And my daddy-'  'Scarper, little snot.'  They sat on coils of rope in the shade of the carts parked amidship,  sipping from the skin and devouring the burbot in turn.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"So a  few crafty dogs tried to grab Geralt, bury him in some cave and then sell him to Rience, dictating their  conditions and trying to bargain as much out of him as possible. Because they would have got very little,  if anything at all, for mere information.'  'My congratulations on such perspicacity. The Geralt's, of course, not yours - it would never have  occurred to you. But the matter is more complex than you think. My colleagues, men belonging to King  Foltest's secret service, are also, as it turns out, interested in Master Rience.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"My colleagues, men belonging to King  Foltest's secret service, are also, as it turns out, interested in Master Rience. They saw through the plan  of those - as you called them - crafty dogs. It is they who boarded the barge, they who wanted to grab  the Geralt. Perhaps as bait for Rience, perhaps for a different end. At Acorn Bay, Dandelion, the Geralt  killed Temerian agents.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Foltest
"A black figure stood framed in the door, blurred by the brightness. 'Who comes?' Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark. 'Geralt?'    'Yes, Eskel. It's me.'  'Come in.'  The Geralt dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into  her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind  completely. 'Wait here with Eskel,' he said.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"She saw that he was human after all, that he had an  entirely human face, deformed by a long, ugly, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth  across the length of his cheek up to the ear. 'Since you're here, welcome to Kaer Morhen,' he said. 'What do they call you?'  'Ciri,' Geralt replied for her, silently emerging from the darkness. Eskel turned around. Suddenly, quickly,  wordlessly, the Geralts fell into each other's arms and wound their shoulders around each other tight and  hard.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"What's more, she saw nothing of what she had  expected in those eyes. 'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek. And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen Geralts, Lambert, was  there with his usual ugly, mocking expression. Vesemir was not there.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"They changed the subject at once. She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"You've achieved what you wanted. And maybe  even more.'  'The devil take it,' cursed Coen. 'We've turned out to be right idiots, there's no two ways about it, eh,  Vesemir, and you' Silence,' growled the old Geralt. 'Not a word.'  It was Eskel's behaviour which was most unlikely; he got up, approached the enchantress, bent down  low, took her hand and kissed it respectfully. She swiftly withdrew her hand.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Not so as to demonstrate  her anger and annoyance but to break the pleasant, piercing vibration triggered by the Geralt's touch. Eskel emanated powerfully. More powerfully than Geralt. 'Triss,' he said, rubbing the hideous scar on his cheek with embarrassment, 'help us. We ask you.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Help  us, Triss.'  The enchantress looked him in the eye and pursed her lips. 'With what? What am I to help you with,  Eskel?'  Eskel rubbed his cheek again, looked at Geralt. The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Understood?'  Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man. Lambert snorted  loudly. Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back. 'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"So let us call it advice. I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"attributes. Do you understand what I'm saying?'  'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her  dress. Eskel cleared his throat and looked daggers at the young Geralt. 'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed  anything irreversible in her, I hope?'  'No.' She smiled. 'Fortunately, not.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Take a sip. You will find it easier to understand.'  'What is it?'  'White Seagull.'  What?'  'A mild remedy,' Eskel smiled, 'for pleasant dreams.'  'Damn it! A Geralt hallucinogenic? That's why your eyes shine like that in the evenings!'  'White Seagull is very gentle. It's Black Seagull that is hallucinogenic'  'If there's magic in this liquid I'm not allowed to take it!'  'Exclusively natural ingredients,' Geralt reassured her but he looked, she noticed, disconcerted.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"In the evenings, consistently and determinedly, Triss guided the long conversations held in the dark hall, lit  only by the bursts of flames in the great hearth, towards politics. The Geralts' reactions were always the  same. Geralt, a hand on his forehead, did not say a word. Vesemir nodded, from time to time throwing in  comments which amounted to little more than that 'in his day' everything had been better, more logical,  more honest and healthier. Eskel pretended to be polite, and neither smiled nor made eye contact, and  even managed, very occasionally, to be interested in some issue or question of little importance.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods. The lady magician knew a surprising amount about a Geralt's sword and 'dance'. She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep. She knew Vesemir and  Eskel.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Eskel
"Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly. The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes.",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani
"Shani of Medicine. And that owl which so craftily flew in my tracks is no owl. This is  Philippa Eilhart from the Council of Wizards, at present in King Vizimir's service and pride of the  Tretogor court. It's a shame we've only got one chair in here.'  'It's quite enough.' The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by  Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani. The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed.",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani
"You're studying medicine, are you, Shani? What year?'  'Third,' grunted the girl. 'Ah,' Philippa Eilhart was looking not at her but at the Geralt, 'seventeen, what a beautiful age. Yennefer  would give a lot to be that age again. What do you reckon, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani
"What does a certain Rience, who has already murdered three people in Sodden and Temeria who were  in touch with me and the girl two years ago, want from her? Who almost murdered Dandelion trying to  extract information about her? Who is this Rience, Philippa?'  'I don't know,' said the magician. 'I don't know who Rience is. But, like you, I'd very much like to find  out.'  'Does this Rience -' Shani unexpectedly - 'have a third-degree burn on his face?",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani

"Don't come near me! Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane.",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani
"You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion. Geralt held her back with a  gesture, stood upright and looked straight into the dark eyes of Philippa Eilhart. 'My destiny,' he said with effort. 'My choice * .",Blood of Elves,Philippa,Shani

"They're coming.'  She glanced at the entrance and saw the shadows of the approaching Geralts only after some time,    heard their steps even later. Oh well, her hearing, which she considered very sensitive, could not compete  with that of a Geralt. 'Triss, my child!'  'Vesemir!'  Vesemir was really very old. Who knows, he could be even older than Kaer Morhen. But he walked  towards her with a brisk, energetic and sprightly step; his grip was vigorous and his hands strong.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"I keep forgetting you are grown up, and I can no longer put you on my knee and pat you. As to my health ... Oh, Triss, old age is no joke. My bones ache so I want to howl. Will you help an old  man, child?'  'I will.' The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the Geralt  accompanying Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"'Exactly. It is.' Vesemir took a deep breath. 'Triss, you must be tired. And hungry?'  'I cannot deny it,' she sighed, giving up on trying to catch Geralt's eye. 'To be honest, I'm on my last legs.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"And then you will sleep as long as you wish, and rest. We have  prepared the best room for you, the one in the tower. And we have put the best bed we could find in  Kaer Morhen there.'  'Thank you.' Triss smiled faintly. In the tower, she thought. All right, Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Vesemir was a Geralt. The fact that he was also an old man did not  change the fact that many a youngster could envy him his health. If the old man had been stung by a  manticore or bitten by a werewolf Triss would have accepted that she had been summoned to aid him. But 'aching bones' was a joke. For an ache in his bones, not a very original complaint within the  horrendously cold walls of Kaer Morhen, Vesemir could have treated with a Geralts' elixir or - an  even simpler solution - with strong rye vodka, applied internally and externally in equal proportions.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Only that the  girl, not being like you, has her days! And bears them exceptionally badly! And you want her to tear her  lungs out on the Killer and some bloody windmills!'  Despite her outrage, Triss felt an exquisite satisfaction at the sight of the sheepish expressions of the  young Geralts, and Vesemir's jaw suddenly dropping open. 'You didn't even know.' She nodded in what was now a calm, concerned and gentle reproach. 'You're  pathetic guardians.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag. Another present from the enchantress gleamed around the girl's neck - a little black viper made of  lacquered leather with a ruby eye and gold clasp.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"'I cannot train today,' she recited in the utter silence, slowly and emphatically, 'for I am ... I am ...'  She looked at the enchantress. Triss winked at her, smirking like a rascal well pleased with his mischief,  and moved her lips to prompt the memorised lines. 'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling. Vesemir hawked again.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"'We understand and clearly  we will postpone your exercises until your indisposition has passed. We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ...",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
For longer. For a long time. But Triss said you have to agree forsooth. Uncle Vesemir! Say yes!'  'I agree ...' Vesemir wheezed out.,Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Say yes!'  'I agree ...' Vesemir wheezed out. 'Of course, I agree ...'  'We are very happy.' Only now did Geralt take his hand from his forehead. 'We are extremely pleased,  Triss.'  The enchantress nodded slightly towards him and innocently fluttered her eyelashes, winding a chestnut  lock around her finger. Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone. 'You behaved very properly and politely, Ciri,' he said, 'offering Miss Merigold our ongoing hospitality in  Kaer Morhen.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"I am proud of you.'  Ciri reddened and smiled broadly. The enchantress gave her the next pre-arranged sign. 'And now,' said the girl, turning her nose up even higher, 'I will leave you alone because you no doubt  wish to talk over various important matters with Triss. Miss Merigold. Uncle Vesemir, gentlemen ...",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir

But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Am I right? The one and only reason?'  'Yes,' Vesemir confirmed after a moment's silence. Triss breathed an imperceptible sigh of relief. For a moment, she was afraid that Geralt would be the one  to confirm it. The first snow fell the following day, fine snowflakes initially, but soon turning into a blizzard.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir

Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic. On such a night as Midinvaerne,  when the air itself was vibrating with magic, the Geralts' medallions must be practically humming. It must  be both irritating and bothersome.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't. Not yet. Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly. 'Did you think to impress me?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing. The magician suddenly realised that she had never, up until now, heard any of the Geralts  laugh.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"Detailed?'  'No.' Geralt looked her straight in the eyes. 'Confused. Don't ask about it, Triss. We are not worried by  the contents of Ciri's prophecies and ravings but about what happens to her. We're not afraid for  ourselves but-'  'Careful,' warned Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"As of tomorrow, every day brings spring  closer!'  'I'm thirsty.' Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice. Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"She laughed, spun a  pirouette and danced on tiptoes. Lambert moved the stool away in a flash, leaving Coen standing  between the dancing girl and the hearth. Triss jumped up and tore an amulet from her pouch - a sapphire  set in silver on a thin chain. She squeezed it tightly in her hand. 'Child ...' groaned Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"It's true. But from what Triss has been telling us all     these evenings, it seems the conflict with Nilfgaard is more serious than that, not just some local little war. Is that right, Triss?'  'Even if it were the case,' said the magician spitefully, 'surely that suits you? A serious, bloody war will  lead to more deserted villages, more widowed women, simply hordes of orphaned children-'  'I can't understand your sarcasm.' Geralt took his hand away from his forehead. 'I really can't, Triss.'  'Nor I, my child.' Vesemir raised his head.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"'Too severe, Wolf,' said Vesemir. 'Much too severe. And you shouldn't have done it in Triss's presence. The emotional ties-'  'Don't talk to me about emotions. I've had enough of all this talk about emotions!'  'And why is that?' The magician smiled derisively and coldly.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"The fact that someone can  experience normal love, normal hatred, normal fear, pain and regret, normal joy and normal sadness. That it is coolness, distance and indifference which are considered abnormal. Oh yes, Geralt, it annoys  you, it annoys you so much that you are starting to think about Kaer Morhen's vaults, about the  Laboratorium, the dusty demijohns full of mutagenic poisons-'  'Triss!' called Vesemir, gazing at Geralt's face, suddenly grown pale. But the enchantress refused to be  interrupted and spoke faster and faster, louder and louder. 'Who do you want to deceive, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Vesemir
"She ought to keep me company-'  'She is undergoing training here, Merigold.' Lambert grimaced in a parody of a smile. He always called  her that: 'Merigold', without giving her a title or a name. Triss hated it. 'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black  beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox. This was unusual; Geralts  were generally highly immune to infectious diseases. 'Triss Merigold, Coen.' Geralt introduced them to each other. 'This is Coen's first winter with us. He  comes from the north, from Poviss.'  The young Geralt bowed.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"'A stable is no place to welcome a guest, but I  couldn't wait to see you.'  In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's  instructions. Deftly balancing on a beam hanging on chains, she was attacking - with her sword -a leather  sack bound with straps to make it resemble a human torso. Triss stopped to watch. 'Wrong!' yelled Lambert. 'You're getting too close!",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"'You've finally got it! Go back and do it again. I want to make sure it  wasn't a fluke!'  'The sword,' Triss turned to the Geralts, 'looks sharp. The beam looks slippery and unstable. And  Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"'My teeth go numb when I drink water! I  want some juice! That blue one!'  'Don't slouch,' said Lambert, stealing a glance at Triss from the corner of his eye. 'And don't wipe your  mouth with your sleeve! Finish your food; it's time for training.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag. Another present from the enchantress gleamed around the girl's neck - a little black viper made of  lacquered leather with a ruby eye and gold clasp.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"You have goats here. Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"She might hold it against you later if you so ruthlessly deprive her of her  womanly ... attributes. Do you understand what I'm saying?'  'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her  dress. Eskel cleared his throat and looked daggers at the young Geralt. 'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed  anything irreversible in her, I hope?'  'No.' She smiled.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"Finally, came the seventh day. The male awoke and opened his eyes, and his eyes were as those of  a viper ... CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't. Not yet. Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly. 'Did you think to impress me?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"A house might goes up in flames. Or sometimes, half a  town goes up.'  'You're exaggerating, Merigold.'  'Lambert.' Geralt released his medallion and rested his hands on the table. 'First, stop calling Triss   Merigold . She has asked you a number of times not to. Second, Triss is not exaggerating.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"'Senseless drivel.'  'Then I have no doubt' - she looked straight at him - 'that you understood each other perfectly well. Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"She laughed, spun a  pirouette and danced on tiptoes. Lambert moved the stool away in a flash, leaving Coen standing  between the dancing girl and the hearth. Triss jumped up and tore an amulet from her pouch - a sapphire  set in silver on a thin chain. She squeezed it tightly in her hand. 'Child ...' groaned Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"Has it got through to you?'  'I'm not stupid!'  'You're a girl. Girls don't have brains.'  'Lambert! If Triss heard that!'  'If ifs and ands were pots and pans. All right, that's enough. Come down.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Lambert
"'You know very well what I'm getting at,' Dijkstra replied coldly. 'However, since you clearly enjoy  playing the idiot I won't spoil your game and will explain using simple words. Or maybe you'd like to  make use of this privilege, Philippa?'  Dandelion glanced at the fourth person present at the meeting, who until then had remained silent. Philippa  Eilhart must have only recently arrived in Oxenfurt, or was perhaps intending to leave at once, since she  wore neither a dress nor her favourite black agate  jewellery nor any sharp makeup. She was wearing a man's short jacket, leggings and high boots - a 'field'  outfit as the poet called it.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"And of being a renegade sorcerer. Isn't that right, Philippa?'  The magician neither affirmed nor denied it. She remained silent, watching Dandelion closely and intently. The poet lowered his eyes and hawked hesitantly. He did not like such gazes.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"I help you sometimes but I do so out of my own free will, from patriotic  duty, so as not to stand by idly in face of the approaching changes  'You spy for anyone who pays you,' Dijkstra interrupted coldly. 'You inform on anyone who has  something on you. And I've got a few pretty good things on you, Dandelion. So don't be saucy.'  'I won't give in to blackmail!'  'Shall we bet on it?'  'Gentlemen.' Philippa Eilhart raised her hand. 'Let's be serious, if you please.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"That's all I require of you at present.'  'Geralt has left,' the bard lied calmly. Dijkstra glanced at the magician. Dandelion, expecting an impulse to  sound out his mind, tensed but he did not feel anything. Philippa was watching him, her eyes narrowed,  but nothing indicated that she was using spells to verify his truthfulness. 'Then I'll wait until he's back,' sighed Dijkstra, pretending to believe him.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"And he'll be left in  peace. I'll calm the Temerians and guarantee his safety.'  'What questions are you talking about? Maybe I can answer them?'  'Don't make me laugh, Dandelion.'  'Yet,' Philippa Eilhart said suddenly, 'perhaps he can? Maybe he can save us time? Don't forget, Dijkstra,  our poet is mixed up to his ears in this affair and we've got him here but we haven't got the Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback. The questions Philippa had raised had clearly been asked too soon. And directed to the wrong person.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"I'd help you if I  could. But I can't.'  Philippa looked him straight in the eyes. 'Dandelion,' she drawled. 'If you know where that girl is, tell us. I assure you that all that I and Dijkstra  care about is her safety.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"I've never seen the child you're so interested in. And Geralt-'  'Geralt,' interrupted Dijkstra, 'never confided in you, never said a word even though, no doubt, you  inundated him with questions. Why do you think that might be, Dandelion? Could it be that this simple  soul, this simpleton who despises spies, sensed who you really are? Leave him alone, Philippa, it's a  waste of time.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"'I've understood how sincerely.'  'I'd like to believe that's true. Well, go now. Ori, show our troubadour to the door.'  'Take care.' Dandelion got to his feet. 'I wish you luck in your work and your personal life. My regards,  Philippa.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly. The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"And that owl which so craftily flew in my tracks is no owl. This is  Philippa Eilhart from the Council of Wizards, at present in King Vizimir's service and pride of the  Tretogor court. It's a shame we've only got one chair in here.'  'It's quite enough.' The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by  Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani. The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed. 'In principle, what I've come about is the sole concern of Geralt of Rivia,' Philippa began after a short  pause.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"I simply have to render it impossible for him to make a mistake. You understand what I'm saying?'  The Geralt confirmed with a nod. Dandelion wondered whether he really did understand, because he  knew that Philippa was lying through her teeth. 'So I see,' said Geralt slowly, proving that he understood perfectly well, 'that the Council of Wizards is  also interested in my ward. The wizards wish to find out where my ward is.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"And guard that child, damn it! Guard that girl as though she's the apple of  your eye! And if you can't do so yourself, ask others to!'  For a moment Dandelion thought the Geralt was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer. He    would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"What do the Temerians want from her? What does a certain Rience, who has already murdered three people in Sodden and Temeria who were  in touch with me and the girl two years ago, want from her? Who almost murdered Dandelion trying to  extract information about her? Who is this Rience, Philippa?'  'I don't know,' said the magician. 'I don't know who Rience is.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa

'I don't know who Rience is.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"'No,' the slim girl had answered, shaking the water  off her green cloak. 'We're almost there ... Hey, Dandelion, don't lag behind or you'll get lost in these  cul-dc-sacs ... And where the hell is Philippa? I  saw her a moment ago, she was flying alongside the canal ...",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"Don't come near me! Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa
"Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion. Geralt held her back with a  gesture, stood upright and looked straight into the dark eyes of Philippa Eilhart. 'My destiny,' he said with effort.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Philippa

"Whistling lightheartedly the poet changed direction and made towards the mansion which housed the  Faculty of Medicine and Herbology. The lane leading to the faculty swarmed with female students  wearing characteristic pale green cloaks. Dandelion searched intently for familiar faces. 'Shani!'  A young medical student with dark red hair cropped just below her ears raised her head from a volume  on anatomy and got up from her bench. 'Dandelion!' She smiled, squinting her happy, hazel eyes.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"They adore your poems '  'Later,' muttered the bard. 'Look discreetly over there, Shani. See those two?'  'Snoops.' The medical student wrinkled her upturned nose and snorted, amazing Dandelion - not for the  first time - with how easily students could recognise secret agents, spies and informers. Students' aversion  to the secret service was legendary, if not very rational. The university grounds were extraterritorial and  sacred, and students and lecturers were untouchable while there - and the service, although it snooped,  did not dare to bother or annoy academics.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"Will you do that, Shani?'  'Of course.' The medical student smiled readily. 'Just out of curiosity to see, close up, the famous-'  'Quieter, I asked you. Only remember: not a word to anyone.'  A physician's secret.' Shani smiled even more beautifully and Dandelion was once more filled with the  desire to finally compose a ballad about girls like her - not too pretty but nonetheless beautiful, girls of  whom one dreams at night when those of classical beauty are forgotten after five minutes. 'Thank you, Shani.'  'It's nothing, Dandelion. See you later.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"'Well, come in then.' Geralt reached for his trousers. 'Since you're coming by way of the window, this  must be important. Because if it isn't I'm going to throw you straight back out through it.'  Dandelion clambered off the sill, knocking down the rest of the onions. He sat down, pulling the  high-backed, wooden chair closer with his foot. The Geralt gathered Shani's clothes and his own from  the floor.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"The medical student, hiding behind him, was  struggling with her shirt. The poet watched her insolently, searching in his mind for similes and rhymes for  the golden colour of her skin in the light of the oil lamp and the curves of her small breasts. 'What's this about, Dandelion?' The Geralt fastened the buckles on his boots. 'Go on.'  'Pack your bags,' he replied dryly. 'Your departure is imminent.'  'How imminent?'  'Exceptionally.'  'Shani ...' Geralt cleared his throat.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly. The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes. 'Good evening,' she said coldly. 'Introduce me, Dandelion.'  'Geralt of Rivia. Shani of Medicine. And that owl which so craftily flew in my tracks is no owl.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani

"And sure. Right in the eyes. He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the  charlatan's house. Rience retreated into the depths of the lane, raising and spreading  both arms in front of him, a magical light already beginning to exude from them. Geralt grasped his sword  with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"Don't come near me! Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"A great and important cause, so important that  minor matters have to be sacrificed for it without second thoughts, if faced with such a choice. Geralt,    damn it, we're nattering and you're standing in a pool of blood. Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here! You can argue later!'  'You and your great cause ...' The Geralt, ignoring the troubadour, staggered forward.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion. Geralt held her back with a  gesture, stood upright and looked straight into the dark eyes of Philippa Eilhart. 'My destiny,' he said with effort.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Shani
"Is  anyone in a position to foresee or describe how the last link in such a chain will look? damn it, we're nattering and you're standing in a pool of blood. Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here! You can argue later!'

"Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs. A gleam was visible below them. Ciri heard voices,  detected the smell of smoke.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek. And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen Geralts, Lambert, was  there with his usual ugly, mocking expression. Vesemir was not there. 'Welcome and come in,' said Eskel.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"My bones ache so I want to howl. Will you help an old  man, child?'  'I will.' The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the Geralt  accompanying Vesemir. He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black  beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox. This was unusual; Geralts  were generally highly immune to infectious diseases. 'Triss Merigold, Coen.' Geralt introduced them to each other.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm. 'A stable is no place to welcome a guest, but I  couldn't wait to see you.'  In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's  instructions. Deftly balancing on a beam hanging on chains, she was attacking - with her sword -a leather  sack bound with straps to make it resemble a human torso. Triss stopped to watch.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"They changed the subject at once. She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"At that moment, the door creaked open and Ciri entered the hall. Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"I bid  you goodbye. For the time being.'     She curtseyed gracefully then left the hall, walking up the stairs slowly and with dignity. 'Bloody hell.' Lambert broke the silence. 'To think I didn't believe that she really is a princess.'  'Have you understood, you idiots?' Vesemir cast his eye around. 'If she puts a dress on in the morning I  don't want to see any exercises ...",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place. Duplicity was a character flaw to he ashamed of.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir

'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't. Not yet. Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly. 'Did you think to impress me?",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs. On the other ...",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"Vesemir nodded, from time to time throwing in  comments which amounted to little more than that 'in his day' everything had been better, more logical,  more honest and healthier. Eskel pretended to be polite, and neither smiled nor made eye contact, and  even managed, very occasionally, to be interested in some issue or question of little importance. Coen  yawned openly and looked at the ceiling, and Lambert did nothing to hide his disdain. They did not want to know anything, they cared nothing for  dilemmas which drove sleep from kings, wizards, rulers and leaders, or for the problems which made  councils, circles and gatherings tremble and buzz. For them, nothing existed beyond the passes drowning  in snow or beyond the Gwenllech river carrying ice-floats in its leaden current.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep. She knew Vesemir and  Eskel. Although not Lambert and Coen. Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen. Ciri guessed why - when they spoke of the Keep - the eyes of the  enchantress grew warm, lost their angry gleam and their cold, indifferent, wise depth.",Blood of Elves,Lambert,Vesemir
"Finally, like all but a few magicians, Triss moved to affairs with other wizards, which  proved sporadic and frustrating in their cold, technical and almost ritual course. Then Geralt of Rivia appeared. A Geralt leading a stormy life, and tied to her good friend Yennefer in a  strange, turbulent and almost violent relationship. Triss had watched them both and was jealous even though it seemed there was little to be jealous of. Their relationship quite obviously made them both unhappy, had led straight to destruction, pain and yet,  against all logic ...",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"... she had seduced the Geralt - with the help of a little magic. She had hit on a propitious moment, a  moment when he and Yennefer had scratched at each other's eyes yet again and had abruptly parted. Geralt had needed warmth, and had wanted to forget. No, Triss had not desired to take him away from Yennefer.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"And you don't have a single friendly magician, not a single one you could trust. Apart from me and ... And Yennefer. The wind howled, banged the shutter and swelled the tapestry. Triss rolled on to her back and, lost in  thought, started to bite her thumb nail.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty. 'I'm not important. I let you down.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"when spring  is here we will take her to Melitele's Temple in Ellander. The thing that wants to possess her might not be  able to reach her in the temple. And then you will ask Yennefer for help.'  'All right, Triss. Thank you.'  'Geralt?'  'Yes.'  'Ciri said something else, didn't she? Something only you heard.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"It would be entirely different ... I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback. The questions Philippa had raised had clearly been asked too soon.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"'Now I know what I wanted to say. I'm thinking about those members of  the Council who have had the least experience. Fercart and Yennefer. Fercart, as far as I know, is tied to  Foltest of Temeria and sits on the king's council with Triss Merigold. But who is Yennefer tied to?",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"Like I did. Like Triss Merigold. Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"Like I did. Like Triss Merigold. Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"But one day, she got carried away  and spoke out. About Triss Merigold. Yennefer, as if casually, as if indifferently, asking as if banal,  sparing questions, dragged the rest from her. Her eyes were hard and impenetrable. Ciri could guess the reason.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Triss
"And  today, there they are - in Hagge Castle - deciding the fate of the world. Interesting. But to be honest, I  expected as much.'  'We know,' confirmed Artaud Terranova. 'And we remember, you warned us about it. That's why we're  telling you about it.'  'Thank you for remembering,' smiled the wizard, and Tissaia de Vries was suddenly sure that he had  already been aware of each of the facts just presented to him, and had been for a long time.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"I can see you are frozen through and tired from your journeys. How many  changes of portals, if I may ask?'  'Three.' Tissaia de Vries shrugged. 'It was nearer for me,' added Artaud. 'Two proved enough. But still complicated, I must admit.'  'Such foul weather everywhere?'  'Everywhere.'  'So let us fortify ourselves with good fare and an old red wine from Cidaris.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"Lydia, would you be so  kind?'  Lydia van Bredevoort, Vilgefortz's assistant and personal secretary, appeared from behind the curtain  like an ethereal phantom and smiled with her eyes at Tissaia de Vries. Tissaia, controlling her face,  replied with a pleasant smile and bow of her head. Artaud Terranova stood up and bowed with  reverence. He, too, controlled his expression very well. He knew Lydia.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"Lydia was a talented  artist. They supped in silence. Artaud Terranova did not stint himself and reached without embarrassment for  the platters and - probably a little too frequently, and without his host's encouragement clanged the silver  top of the carafe of red wine. Tissaia de Vries ate slowly, devoting more attention to arranging her plates,  cutlery and napkins symmetrically - although, in her opinion, they still lay irregularly and hurt her  predilection for order and her aesthetic sensibility - than to the fare. She drank sparingly.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"My protection  against magical eavesdropping is stronger there, too. Let us go. You can bring the carafe, Artaud.'  'I won't say no. It's my favourite vintage.'  They went through to the workshop. Tissaia could not stop herself from casting an eye over the  workbench weighed down with retorts, crucibles, test-tubes, crystals and numerous magical utensils.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"'Forgive me,' he said, 'but this is urgent. I've been waiting for this letter since yesterday. It will only take a  minute.'  Artaud yawned, muffled a belch and reached for the carafe. Tissaia looked at Lydia. Lydia smiled.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"I have given orders to prepare chambers for your guests. 'Thank you. Tissaia, Artaud, I apologise for the short delay. Let us continue. Where were we?'  Nowhere, thought Tissaia de Vries.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"Fercart, as far as I know, is tied to  Foltest of Temeria and sits on the king's council with Triss Merigold. But who is Yennefer tied to? You  said, Artaud, that she is one of those who are serving kings.'  'Artaud exaggerated,' said Tissaia calmly. 'Yennefer is living in Vengerberg so Demawend sometimes  turns to her for help, but they do not work together all the time. It cannot be said for certain that she is  serving Demawend.'  'How is her sight?",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"It will  get there without fail. And Yennefer, wherever she is, will reply. She always does.'  'Yennefer,' threw in Artaud, 'frequently disappears, sometimes for entire months. The reasons tend to be  quite trivial ...'  Tissaia looked at him, pursing her lips. The wizard fell silent.",Blood of Elves,Artaud,Tissaia
"Sing to us of what happened next!'  'Songs and ballads' the musician bowed - 'never end, dear lady, because poetry is eternal and immortal,  it knows no beginning, it knows no end-'  'But what happened next?' The tradeswoman didn't give up, generously rattling coins into the bucket  Dandelion's apprentice held out to her. 'At least tell us about it, even if you have no wish to sing of it. Your songs mention no names, but we know the Geralt you sing of is no other than the famous Geralt of  Rivia, and the enchantress for whom he burns with love is the equally famous Yennefer. And the Child  Surprise, destined for the Geralt and sworn to him from birth, is Ciri, the unfortunate Princess of  Cintra, the town destroyed by the Invaders. Am I right?'  Dandelion smiled, remaining enigmatic and aloof.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'Sing on, Master  Dandelion! What happened next? Did the Geralt and Yennefer the Enchantress find each other in the  end? And did they love each other? Were they happy?",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"It is the truth,  the sincere truth, which Master Dandelion sang for us.'  'I second that,' said a slender female warrior with her black hair smoothly brushed back and plaited into a  thick braid. 'I, Rayla of Lyria, also know Geralt the White Wolf, the famous slayer of monsters. And I've  met the enchantress, Lady Yennefer, on several occasions -I used to visit Aedirn and her home town of  Vengerberg. I don't know anything about their being in love, though.'  'But it has to be true,' the attractive elf in the ermine toque   You did not see that these ballads speak of man's fate, that we are no more than toys in the hands of the  gods, our lands no more than their playground. The ballads about destiny portrayed the destinies of us all,  and the legend of Geralt the Geralt and Princess Ciri - although it is set against the true background  of that war - is, after all, a mere metaphor, the creation of a poet's imagination designed to help us-'  'You're talking rubbish, holy man!' hollered Vera Loewenhaupt from the heights of her cart.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"It is the truth,  the sincere truth, which Master Dandelion sang for us.'  'I second that,' said a slender female warrior with her black hair smoothly brushed back and plaited into a  thick braid.

'But it has to be true,' the attractive elf in the ermine toque    many a time and the king and queen lived in a childless home, with no daughter, no son-'  'Liar!' shouted a red-haired man in a sealskin jacket, a checked kerchief bound around his forehead. 'Queen Calanthe, the Lionness of Cintra, had a daughter called Pavetta.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'Help!' he howled. 'Help!'  'Stop yelling, Dandelion,' said the woman, kneeling next to him and slicing through the knots with Rience's  stiletto. 'Yennefer? Is that you?'    'Surely you're not going to say you don't remember how I look. And I'm sure my voice is not unfamiliar  to your musical ear.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'We'll check.' The enchantress snicked the stiletto shut. 'One of them should still be alive. I've a few  questions for him.'  'This one,' the troubadour stood over the reeking man, 'probably still lives.'  'I doubt it,' said Yennefer indifferently. 'I severed his windpipe and carotid artery. There might still be a  little murmur in him but not for long.'  Dandelion shuddered.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"Haven't forgotten anything?'  'Nothing. Apart from  thank you . Thank you, Yennefer.' She looked him in the eyes and nodded her  head lightly, making her glistening, black curls writhe and cascade down to her shoulders. She slipped the  roast chicken onto a trencher and began dividing it skilfully, She used a knife and fork. Dandelion had  only known one person, up until then, who could eat a chicken with a knife and fork as skilfully.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"More wine, if you please!'  'At your command, honoured lady! Quick as a flash!'  'The same as before, please, but this time without the water. I can only tolerate water in a bath, in wine I  find it quite loathsome.'  'At your service, at your service!'  Yennefer pushed her plate aside. There was still enough meat on the chicken, Dandelion noticed, to feed  the innkeeper and his family for breakfast. A knife and fork were certainly elegant and refined, but they  weren't very effective.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"That cursed Rience wouldn't have spared my life. He'd have  squeezed everything from me and then butchered me like a sheep.'  'Yes, I think he would.' She poured herself and the bard some wine then raised her tumbler. 'So let's  drink to your rescue and health, Dandelion.'  And to yours, Yennefer,' he toasted her in return. 'To health for which - as of today - I shall pray  whenever the occasion arises. I'm indebted to you, beautiful lady, and I shall repay the debt in my songs.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"I listened to your ballads beneath Bleobheris, Dandelion. You dedicated a good few verses to me.'  'Poetry,' he muttered, staring at the chicken, 'has its rights. No one should be offended-'  ' I lair like a raven's wing, as a storm in the night ...'  quoted Yennefer with exaggerated emphasis, ' ... and in the violet eyes sleep lightning bolts ... Isn't that how it went?'  'That's how I remembered you.' The poet smiled faintly.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'... or perhaps you listened to someone's confidences and grievances?'  'Hmm ...' Dandelion cleared his throat and veered away from the dangerous subject. 'Tell me, Yennefer,  when did you last see Geralt?'  'A long time ago.'  'After the war?'  After the war ...' Yennefer's voice changed a little. 'No, I never saw him after the war. For a long time  ...",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'People who  forget  to introduce themselves by conveying greetings from a  mutual acquaintance. Understand?'  He looked at her surprised. Yennefer smiled. 'Greetings from Dijkstra, Dandelion.'  Now the bard glanced around timidly. His astonishment must have been evident and his expression  amusing because the sorceress allowed herself a quite derisive grimace.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"I would go, but I honestly don't know where it is ... That place whose name I prefer not to say ...'  'Get to the point, Dandelion.'     'If you know where Geralt is, you ought to go and warn him. You owe him that, Yennefer. There was,  after all, something between you.'  'Yes,' she acknowledged coldly. 'There was something between us.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"I guess  you used to be ... a guest there ... ?'  Yennefer turned away. Dandelion saw her lips pinch, the muscles in her cheek quiver. 'Yes, in the past,' she said and there was something elusive and strange in her voice.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback. The questions Philippa had raised had clearly been asked too soon.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"Dijkstra?'  'You've guessed.'  'That's still no reason-'  'It's reason enough,' interrupted Dandelion. 'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt. They're after the girl and Yennefer. Dijkstra wants to know where they are. He's going to force you to  disclose it to him.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"And guard that child, damn it! Guard that girl as though she's the apple of  your eye! And if you can't do so yourself, ask others to!'  For a moment Dandelion thought the Geralt was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer. He    would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Dandelion
"'Closer.'  He obeyed. The dwarf lowered his axe and tilted his head a little. 'Either my eyes deceive me,' he said, 'or it's the Geralt Geralt of Rivia. Or someone who looks damn  like him.'  The fire suddenly shot up into flames, bursting into a golden brightness which drew faces and figures from  the dark. 'Yarpen Zigrin,' declared Geralt, astonished.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Boys! Over here! You remember my boys, Geralt? This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and  here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.'    Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically  square in their thick quilted jerkins. 'There were six of you,' one by one he squeezed the hard, gnarled hands offered him, 'if I remember  correctly.'  'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Somehow we  haven't managed to find anybody worthy of his place yet. Pity, six is just right, not too many, not too few. To eat a calf, knock back a barrel, there's nothing like six-'  'As I see,' with a nod Geralt indicated the rest of the group standing undecided by the wagons, 'there are  enough of you here to manage three calves, not to mention a quantity of poultry. What's this gang of  fellows you're commanding, Yarpen?'  'I'm not the one in command. Allow me to introduce you.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
That was how men accustomed to wearing hauberks and  belts weighed down with weapons moved. Wenck was a professional soldier. Geralt was prepared to  wager any sum on it. He shook the proffered hand and gave a little bow. 'Let's sit down.' Yarpen indicated the stump where his mighty axe was still embedded.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Crushed garlic and  bitter salt has no right to slink, even if it's a hundred years old.'  'It's foul, uugghh. Triss won't eat that!'  'We'll use my grandmother's method. You squeeze her nose and I'll shove the pellets in.'  'Yarpen,' Geralt hissed, emerging abruptly from the darkness     with the magician in his arms. 'Watch out or I'll shove something down you.'  'It's medicine!' The dwarf took offence. 'It helps!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Mould, garlic ...'  'Yes,' moaned Triss weakly from the depths of her cocoon. 'It's true ... Geralt, it really ought to help . . .'  'See?' Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who  swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
".'  'See?' Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who  swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression. 'A wise magician. Knows what's good for her.'  'What are you saying, Triss?' The Geralt leaned over. 'Ah, I see. Yarpen, do you have any angelica?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"I'm listening.'  'What sort of convoy is this?'  The dwarf raised his small, piercing eyes at him. 'The king's service,' he said slowly and emphatically. 'That's what I thought.' The Geralt held the gaze. 'Yarpen, I'm not asking out of any inappropriate  curiosity.'  'I know. And I also know what you mean.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"special.'  'So what are you transporting?'  'Salt fish,' said Yarpen casually, and proceeded to embellish his lie without batting an eyelid. 'Fodder,  tools, harnesses, various odds and ends for the army. Wenck is a quartermaster to the king's army.'  'If he's quartermaster then I'm a druid,' smiled Geralt. 'But that's your affair - I'm not in the habit of  poking my nose into other people's secrets. But you can see the state Triss is in.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Of course he  has to bear you in mind.'  'Who is this Triss to you?'  'What difference does it make in this situation?'  'In this situation none. I asked out of an inappropriate curiosity born of the desire to start new rumours  going around the inns. But be that as it may, you're mighty attracted to this enchantress, Geralt.'  The Geralt smiled sadly. 'And the girl?' Yarpen indicated Ciri with his head as she wriggled under the sheepskin. 'Yours?'  'Mine,' he replied without thinking.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Ciri heard the sound of the camp packing up - horses stamping,  harnesses ringing, poles squeaking, swingle-trees grating, and talking and cursing. And then, nearby,  Yarpen Zigrin's hoarse voice and the calm voice of the tall man called Wenck. And the cold voice of  Geralt. She raised herself and carefully peered out from behind the canvas. 'I have no categorical interdictions on this matter,' declared Wenck.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Please don't count on my sword. I have no intention of killing  those, as you call them, evil creatures on the order of other creatures whom I do not consider to be any  better.'  Ciri heard Yarpen Zigrin hiss loudly and cough into his rolled-up sleeve. Wenck stared at the Geralt  calmly. 'I see,' he stated dryly. 'I like clear situations.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'That pleases me,' he said after a normal pause. 'In taking Lady Merigold aboard a wagon in my convoy I  take on the responsibility lor her health, comfort and safety. Zigrin, give the command to march out.'  'Wenck.'  'Yes, Geralt?'  'Thank you.'  The commissar bowed his head, a bit more deeply and politely, it seemed to Ciri, than the usual,  perfunctory politeness required. Yarpen Zigrin ran the length of the column, giving orders and instructions loudly, after which he  clambered onto the coachman's box, shouted and whipped the horses with the reins. The wagon jolted  and rattled along the forest trail.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"She couldn't see her  chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun. No doubt they were at the rear, with the convoy's spare horses. Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen. They were talking quietly, drinking beer from a  barrel perched between them. Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war. Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence. Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help. Geralt was surprised that the aid had to be quite so secretive, to which the  dwarf replied that was why the secret was a secret. Triss tossed in her sleep, shook the compress off and talked indistinctly to herself.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"She demanded that  someone called Kevyn kept his hands to himself, and immediately after that declared that destiny cannot  be avoided. Finally, having stated that everyone, absolutely everyone, is a mutant to a certain degree, she  fell into a peaceful sleep. Ciri also felt sleepy but was brought to her senses by Yarpen's chuckle, as he reminded Geralt of their  past adventures. This one concerned a hunt for a golden dragon who instead of allowing itself to be  hunted down had counted the hunters' bones and then eaten  a cobbler called Goatmuncher. Ciri began to listen with greater interest.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Ciri began to listen with greater interest. Geralt asked about what had happened to the Slashers but Yarpen didn't know. Yarpen, in turn, was  curious about a woman called Yennefer, at which Geralt grew oddly uncommunicative. The dwarf drank  more beer and started to complain that Yennefer still bore him a grudge although a good few years had  gone by since those days. 'I came across her at the market in Gors Velen,' he recounted.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'She barely noticed me - she spat like a  she-cat and insulted my deceased mother horribly. I fled for all I was worth, but she shouted after me  that she'd catch up with me one day and make grass grow out of my arse.'  Ciri giggled, imagining Yarpen with the grass. Geralt grunted something about women and their impulsive  natures - which the dwarf considered far too mild a description for maliciousness, obstinacy and  vindictiveness. Geralt did not take up the subject and Ciri fell into dozing once more. This time she was woken by raised voices.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Call me a traitor and a dog  on a human leash  who for a handful of silver and a bowl of lousy food, is prepared to be set against his rebelling kinsmen  who are fighting for freedom. Well, go on, spit it out. I don't like insinuations.'  'No, Yarpen,' said Geralt quietly. 'No. I'm not going to spit anything out.'    'Ah, you're not?' The dwarf whipped the horses.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"You get on my nerves.'  Geralt turned away. Ciri held her breath in anticipation. But the Geralt didn't say a word. He stood and  jumped from the wagon, swiftly, softly and nimbly. Yarpen waited for him to untether his mare from the  ladder, then whipped his horses once again, growling something incomprehensible, sounding terrifying  under his breath.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins. 'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf. 'As you can see,  it's better to have a Geralt-girl on your wagon than to travel alone. I warned you just in time. But if you'd  been in the middle of pissing from the box and ridden onto that log, well, well.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'The Squirrels are fighting for freedom. And although you're a dwarf,  you're King Henselt's special secret servant on a human leash.'  Yarpen snorted, wiped his nose on his sleeve and leaned out of the box to check that Wenck had not  ridden up too close. But the commissar was far away, engaged in conversation with Geralt. 'You've got pretty good hearing, girl, like a marmot.' He grinned broadly. 'You're also a bit too bright for  someone destined to give birth, cook and spin.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"You wanted to know, didn't you? So you've got the honest truth and faithful  history of a world where he who shatters the skulls of others most efficiently and swells women's bellies  fastest, reigns. And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Hey,  Zigrin, if you had a woman would you wash her and comb her hair? Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'Ciri, is the water  hot yet? Leave it, leave  it, you'll burn yourself and get dirty from the cauldron. I know you're strong but let me - I'll carry it.'  Geralt was already waiting for them; they could see his white hair through the gap in the canvas covering  the wagon from afar. The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her. They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own. They coped exceptionally well - he supported the  enchantress in his arms, Ciri washed and dried her.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her. He did not need to lean over in  order to do so, as Geralt did. He was no taller than her. 'Never make the same mistake, little Geralt-girl,' he murmured, indicating the wagon with his eyes.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
'Yarpen?'  'Yes?'  'Who's right? The Squirrels or you? Geralt wants to be ... neutral. You serve King Henselt even though  you're a dwarf.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"We managed to  partially convince humans that we're not so very different-'  'We're not different at all, Yarpen.'  The dwarf turned abruptly. 'We're not different at all,' repeated Ciri. 'After all, you think and feel like Geralt. And like ... like I do.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'In Brugge. During the pogrom.'  *  'Riders!' shouted one of Wenck's advance guards. 'Riders ahead!'  The commissar trotted up to Yarpen's wagon and Geralt approached from the other side. 'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely. 'Get off the box and get in the back!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"It's like trying to catch the wind-'  'Good, enough, we're not interested,' the commissar interrupted him brusquely. 'Time presses and we still  have a long journey ahead of us.'  'Fare you well then. Hey, follow me!'  'You heard, Geralt?' snarled Yarpen Zigrin, watching the patrol ride away. 'There are bloody Squirrels in  the vicinity. I felt it.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Ha, she thought, looking around, the safety of the entire  convoy depends on me now. They're all waiting impatiently for me to return and report: the way is clear  and passable, I didn't see anyone - there are no traces of wheels or hooves. I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"She remembered the elf's boots, ruined and reaching up to the knees, laced at  the bottom and fastened at the top with many wrought buckles. Elves who kill humans and die in battles themselves. Geralt says you have to remain neutral ... And  Yarpen says you have to behave in such a way that you don't have to ask for forgiveness ... She kicked a molehill and, lost in thought, dug her heel into the sand.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"From thickets, flaming arrows flew towards the wagons like fire birds,  perforating the canvas and digging into the boards. The Scoia'tael attacked with war-cries and yells. Ciri, ignoring Geralt's shouts from behind her, directed her horse straight at the first two wagons brought  to the fore. One was lying on its side and Yarpen Zigrin, axe in one hand, crossbow in the other, stood  next to it. At his feet, motionless, with her blue dress hitched halfway up her thighs, lay ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'Jump!' yelled Yarpen, shouting over the noise. 'Jump. Yannick!'  Ciri saw Geralt catch up with the speeding wagon and with a short, spare slash of his sword swipe one of  the elves from his saddle while Wenck, riding up on the opposite side, hewed at the other, the elf  shooting the horses. Yannick threw the reins down and jumped off - straight under the third Scoia'tael's  horse. The elf stood in his stirrups and slashed at him with his sword.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering. Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"'Aid for Demawend from Aedirn.' Yarpen Zigrin, standing nearby, ground his teeth. 'Secret and  exceptionally important aid. A convoy of special significance!'  'It was a trap?'  The dwarf turned, looked at her, at Geralt. Then he looked back at the stones pouring from the barrels  and spat. 'Yes,' he confirmed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Hey, quick now, bring the stretcher! Stretcher!'  'No need,' the magician said hollowly, gazing at Wenck's lips where no more bubbles appeared. Ciri  turned away and pressed her face to Geralt's side. Fredegard drew himself up. Yarpen Zigrin did not look at him.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand. Then  she added a few words she had heard Yarpen Zigrin use, the meanings of which were a total mystery to  her. With a kick, she dispersed the chickens swarming towards the scattered grain, picked up the basket,  turned it upside down, then twirled in a Geralt's pirouette and threw the basket like a discus over the  reed roof of the henhouse. She turned on her heel and set off through the Temple park at a run. She ran lightly, skilfully controlling her breath.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Yarpen
"Nenneke is an exceptional woman and Goddess Melitele's  sanctuary an exceptional place. Safe, sure, and it guarantees an appropriate education for the girl. Does  Ciri know yet?'     'She does. She kicked up a fuss for a few days but finally accepted the idea. Now she is even looking  forward to spring with impatience, excited by the prospect of an expedition to Temeria.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke

"Mother Nenneke told me to end with Praise be to Great Melitele, may her blessing and favour  always go with you. And may nothing happen to you.

"Who else? Again! Oh gods, that's terrible!'  'Aren't you exaggerating a bit with this war, Iola?' Ciri scattered some grains for the chickens and  guinea-hens crowding around them in a busy, noisy whirl. 'Maybe it's only another raid on the Scoia'tael?'  'Mother Nenneke asked the greeve the same thing,' declared Iola the Second. 'And the greeve said that  no, this time it wasn't about the Squirrels.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Just a  moment, wait, I'll take those books ... Does Lady Yennefer know you're here?'  'No.'  'Hmm ... Or Mother Nenneke?'  Ciri pulled a face. She knew what he meant. The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward,  being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward,  being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler. He lived in Ellander where he worked as a scribe at  the municipal tribunal, but he spent more time in Melitele's sanctuary than in the town, studying, copying  and illuminating volumes in the Temple library for whole days and sometimes even nights. Ciri had never  heard it from Nenneke's lips but it was well known that the high priestess absolutely did not want Jarre to  hang around her young novices. And vice-versa. But the novices, however, did sneak keen glances at the  boy and chatted freely, discussing the various possibilities presented by the presence on the Temple  grounds of something which wore trousers.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"But Nenneke doesn't like it. You know that.'  'But I haven't ... I don't care about Jarre in the least.' Ciri blushed a little. 'I only ...'  'Exactly,' muttered the enchantress. 'You only.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"The priestess grimaced with animosity. And Iola the First came up to me with a strange  expression of her face. 'Get yourself together, Ciri,' she said, 'and go the refectory, quick. Mother  Nenneke is summoning you. Someone has arrived.'  Strange, meaningful glances, excitement in their eyes.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Yennefer. 'Magician Yennefer. Quick, Ciri, hurry up. Mother Nenneke is waiting. And she is waiting.'  I knew immediately, thought Ciri, that it was her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Yennefer turned and the obsidian star on her neck glittered with a thousand reflections. 'You're right,' admitted the girl seriously, looking straight into the magician's violet eyes. 'I didn't like you.'  'Ciri,' said Nenneke, 'come closer. This is Lady Yennefer from Vengerberg, Mistress of Wizardry. Don't  be frightened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"'Well, come on, girl. We don't have much time. It would be a sin  to waste it.'  Ciri could barely keep her hands from shaking; she swallowed hard and looked inquiringly at Nenneke. The high priestess was serious, as if sad, and the smile with which she answered the unspoken question  was unpleasantly false. 'You're going with Lady Yennefer now,' she said.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"'Lady Yennefer is going to be looking after you for a  while.'  Ciri bowed her head and clenched her teeth. 'You are no doubt baffled,' continued Nenneke, 'that a Mistress of Wizardry is suddenly taking you into  her care. But you are a reasonable girl, Ciri. You can guess why. You have inherited certain ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"'Your abilities will either have to be extinguished or you will have to learn how to control them. If you are  gifted and want to, I can try to instil in you some elementary knowledge of magic.'  'What does  elementary  mean?'  'Basic'  They were alone in the large chamber next to the library in an unoccupied side wing of the building, which  Nenneke had allocated to the lady magician. Ciri knew that this chamber was used by guests. She knew  that Geralt, whenever he visited the Temple, stayed right here. 'Are you going to want to teach me?' She sat on the bed and skimmed her hand over the damask  eiderdown.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Yennefer was firm, frequently  stern, sometimes masterfully formidable. But she was never boring. Previously, Ciri could barely keep  her eyes open in the Temple school and would  sometimes even doze off during a lesson, lulled by the monotonous, gentle voice of Nenneke, Iola the  First, Hrosvitha or some other teacher. With Yennefer, it was impossible. And not only because of the  timbre of the lady magician's voice and the short, sharply accentuated sentences she used.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Down, quickly. The hand ... like this?'  'And the little finger?'     'It's impossible to position it like that without bending the ring finger at the same time!'  'Give me your hand.'  'Ouuuch!'  'Not so loud, Ciri, otherwise Nenneke will come running again, thinking that I'm skinning you alive or  frying you in oil. Don't change the position of your fingers. And now perform the gesture.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Nor did she have any problems enunciating the frequently complicated intonations. Yennefer  was clearly pleased and, from day to day, was becoming more pleasant and sympathetic. More and  more frequently, taking breaks in the studies, both gossiped and joked about any old thing; both even  began to amuse themselves by delicately poking fun at Nenneke who often 'visited' their lectures and  exercises - bristling and puffed up like a brooding hen - ready to take Ciri under her protective wing, to  protect and save her from the magician's imagined severity and the 'inhuman tortures' of her education. Obeying instructions, Ciri moved to Yennefer's chamber. Now they were together not only by day but  also by night.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Ever since she had met Geralt in Sodden, she had believed she had begun 'another life', that the  other life - the one in Cintra - had been irrevocably wiped out. The Geralts in Kaer Morhen never  asked her about anything and, before coming to the temple, Geralt had even prevailed upon her not to  say a word to anyone about who she was. Nenneke, who, of course knew about everything, saw to it  that to the other priestesses and the novices Ciri was exceptionally ordinary, an illegitimate daughter of a  knight and a peasant woman, a child for whom there had been no place either in her father's castle or her  mother's cottage. Half of the novices in Melitele's Temple were just such children. And Yennefer too knew the secret.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Is it right to do that? Mother Nenneke taught us that we mustn't  take anything just like that, for the fun of it. Even the cherry has to be left on its tree for the birds, so that  it can simply fall.'  Yennefer put her arm around Ciri, kissed her gently on the hair at her temple. 'I wish,' she muttered, 'others could hear what you said. Vil-gefortz, Francesca, Terranova ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"I'll just conjure up some ice ...'  There was a great fuss about that small amount of blood. Yennefer and Nenneke did not talk to each  other for a week. For a week, Ciri lazed around, read books and got bored because the magician had put her studies on  hold. The girl did not see her for entire days - Yennefer disappeared somewhere at dawn, returned in the  evening, looked at her strangely and was oddly taciturn. After a week, Ciri had had enough.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Hurt with the strange sort of  pain oddly associated with bliss. To relax, they once again ran around the park. Yennefer persuaded Nenneke to take Ciri's sword out of  storage and so enabled the girl to practise her steps, dodges and attacks - in secret, of course, to prevent  the other priestesses and novices seeing her. But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"Only Nenneke saw them off. She spoke quietly and at length with Yennefer, then they both - the  magician and the priestess -shook each other's hand, hard, like men. Ciri, holding the reins of her  dapple-grey mare, wanted to say goodbye in the same way, but Nenneke did not allow it. She embraced  her, hugged her and gave her a kiss. There were tears in her eyes.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Nenneke
"To avoid getting it wrong you can call me  by my name, Triss. Just Triss. Come on, Ciri. My horse is waiting at the bottom. We'll go to Kaer  Morhen together.'  'I ought to run.' Ciri shook her head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"We'll go to Kaer  Morhen together.'  'I ought to run.' Ciri shook her head. 'It's not good to stop running because you get milk in your muscles. Geralt says-'  'Geralt is at the keep?'  Ciri frowned, pinched her lips together and shot a glance at the enchantress from beneath her ashen  fringe. Triss chuckled again. 'All right,' she said.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"But I, little Ciri, do not recognise collective responsibility, I do not feel the need to  expiate the events which took place half a century before my birth. And the skeletons which are meant to  serve as an eternal reminder will ultimately rot away completely, disintegrate into dust and be forgotten,  will disappear with the wind which constantly whips the mountainside ... 'They don't want to lie like that,' said Ciri suddenly. 'They don't want to be a symbol, a bad conscience  or a warning. But neither do they want their dust to be swept away by the wind.'  Triss raised her head, hearing a change in the girl's voice.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The day will  come when the Hill will claim you. The mass grave, and the obelisk on which your name is engraved, will  claim you.'  The gelding neighed loudly, tossing its head. Ciri jerked suddenly, shuddered. 'What happened?' asked Triss, trying to control her voice. Ciri coughed, passed both hands through her hair and rubbed her face.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The grate of an iron-clad door reached her, coming  from the dark void of the corridor which gaped behind the battered portal. She slipped the fur cape from  her shoulders, removed her fox-fur hat and, with a swift movement of the head, tousled her hair - long,  full locks the colour of fresh chestnuts, with a sheen of gold, her pride and identifying characteristic. Ciri sighed with admiration. Triss smiled, pleased by the effect she'd had. Beautiful, long, loose hair was a  rarity, an indication of a woman's position, her status, the sign of a free woman, a woman  who belonged to herself.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The Geralts appeared unexpectedly and silently, as usual, and, also as usual, from nowhere. They stood  before her, tall, slim, their arms crossed, the weight of their bodies on their left legs - a position from  which, she knew, they could attack in a split second. Ciri stood next to them, in an identical position. In  her ludicrous clothes, she looked very funny. 'Welcome to Kaer Morhern, Triss.'  'Greetings, Geralt.'  He had changed.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm. 'A stable is no place to welcome a guest, but I  couldn't wait to see you.'  In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's  instructions. Deftly balancing on a beam hanging on chains, she was attacking - with her sword -a leather  sack bound with straps to make it resemble a human torso. Triss stopped to watch.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The Geralt shrugged. Triss, knowing him a little, immediately changed tactics and gave up the argument. She looked at Ciri again. The girl, agilely stepping along the balance beam, executed a half-turn, cut  lightly, and immediately leaped away. The dummy, struck, swayed on its rope.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Triss giggled. Ha, she thought, Geralts, I've got you! Ciri scared you just as she did me. She 'withdrew'  into a daydream, started to prophesy, gave out an aura which, after all, you can sense almost as well as I  can. She automatically reached for something psy-chokinetically, or bent a pewter spoon with her will as  she stared at it during lunch.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Finish your food; it's time for training. The days are getting shorter.'  'Geralt.' Triss finished her porridge. 'Ciri fell on the Trail yesterday. Nothing serious, but it was because  of that jester's outfit she wears. It all fits so badly, and it hinders her movements.'  Vesemir cleared his throat and turned his eyes away.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Triss turned her eyes away. His smile was not for her. Ciri's little room was a faithful replica of the Geralts' quarters. It was, like theirs, devoid of almost all  fittings and furniture. There was practically nothing there beside a few planks nailed together to form a  bed, a stool and a trunk.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"There was practically nothing there beside a few planks nailed together to form a  bed, a stool and a trunk. Geralts decorated the walls and doors of their quarters with the skins of  animals they killed when hunting - stags, lynx, wolves and even wolverines. On the door of Ciri's little  room, however, hung the skin of an enormous rat with a hideous scaly tail. Triss fought back her desire to  tear the stinking abomination down and throw it out of the window. The girl, standing by the bed, stared at her expectantly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I've always had a knack for  cutting and sewing so I ought to be able to manage this goatskin, too. And you, little Geralt-girl, have  you ever had a needle in your hand? Have you been taught anything other than making holes with a  sword in sacks of straw?'  'When I was in Transriver, in Kagen, I had to spin,' muttered Ciri unwillingly. 'They didn't give me any  sewing because I only  spoilt the linen and wasted thread; they had to undo everything. The spinning was terribly boring - yuk!'  'True,' giggled Triss.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Conjure them up?'  'There's no need. A magic needle is enough, one which we shall charm into working more vigorously. And if there's a need ...'  Triss slowly ran her hand across the torn hole in the sleeve of Ciri's jacket, murmuring a spell while  stimulating an amulet to work. Not a trace remained of the hole. Ciri squealed with joy.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Can you really walk? Run?'  Both hips and her left thigh were black and blue with haematomas and swellings. Ciri shuddered and  hissed, pulling away from the magician's hand. Triss swore viciously in Dwarvish, using inexpressibly foul  language. 'Was that the windmill, too?' she asked, trying to remain calm.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"On your side? What was that? A smith's hammer?'  Ciri hissed with pain and blushed. 'I fell off the comb ...'  '... and the comb thumped you,' finished Triss, controlling herself with increasing difficulty.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Can you turn me into a boy?'  'No,' Triss replied in an icy tone. 'I can't.'  'Hmm ...' The little Geralt-girl was clearly troubled. 'But could you at least ...'  'At least what?'  'Could you do something so I don't have to ...' Ciri blushed. 'I'll whisper it in your ear.'  'Go on.' Triss leaned over. 'I'm listening.'  Ciri, growing even redder, brought her head closer to the enchantress's chestnut hair.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"She was put on a pony when she  was five and when she was eight she was already riding out hunting. She was taught to use a bow, javelin  and sword. A bruise is nothing new to Ciri-'  'Don't give me that nonsense,' Triss flared. 'Don't pretend you're stupid. This is not some pony or horse  or sleigh ride.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"For almost half a year, having been taken in by a peasant family, she worked on the land and with  the livestock. Believe me, Triss, life has tried, seasoned and hardened her no less than good-for-nothings  like us, who were brought to Kaer Morhen from the highways. Ciri is no weaker than unwanted  bastards, like us, who were left with Geralts in taverns like kittens in a wicker basket. And her gender? What difference does that make?'  'You still ask?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag. Another present from the enchantress gleamed around the girl's neck - a little black viper made of  lacquered leather with a ruby eye and gold clasp. Ciri stopped in front of Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I am ...'  She looked at the enchantress. Triss winked at her, smirking like a rascal well pleased with his mischief,  and moved her lips to prompt the memorised lines. 'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling. Vesemir hawked again. But Eskel, dear Eskel, kept his head and once more behaved as was fitting.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ... that is, Miss Merigold, to ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'We are extremely pleased,  Triss.'  The enchantress nodded slightly towards him and innocently fluttered her eyelashes, winding a chestnut  lock around her finger. Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone. 'You behaved very properly and politely, Ciri,' he said, 'offering Miss Merigold our ongoing hospitality in  Kaer Morhen. I am proud of you.'  Ciri reddened and smiled broadly. The enchantress gave her the next pre-arranged sign.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried. 'But we've already promised to ease Ciri's training, Triss. What  other conditions do you want to impose?'  'Well, maybe  conditions  isn't a very nice phrase. So let us call it advice.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised. That was sensible, responsible and humane.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The first snow fell the following day, fine snowflakes initially, but soon turning into a blizzard. It fell  throughout the night and, in the early morning, the walls of Kaer Morhen were drowned beneath a  snowdrift. There could be no question of running the Killer, especially since Ciri was still not feeling very  well. Triss suspected that the Geralts' accelerants might be the cause of the girl's menstrual problems. She could not be sure, however, knowing practically nothing about the drugs, and Ciri was, beyond  doubt, the only girl in the world to whom they had been administered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"A cold, determined resolution was growing in her. She did not want to sleep alone any longer. 'Triss!' yelled Ciri suddenly, running down the stairs, stamping. 'Can I sleep with you tonight? Triss,  please, please say yes!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss

"CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I am loyal. And believe me, in this matter I can be loyal to both you and to the Chapter.'  'Such double loyalty' - Geralt looked her in the eyes for the first time that evening - 'is devilishly difficult to  manage. Rarely does it succeed, Triss.'  The enchantress turned her gaze on Ciri. The girl was sitting on a bearskin with Coen, tucked away in the  far corner of the hall, and both were busy playing a hand-slapping game. The game was growing  monotonous as both were incredibly quick - neither could manage to slap the other's hand in any way.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"She is  not so remarkable as to make us fall on our knees and raise our eyes to the heavens. Is there a lack of  female warriors roaming the world? I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"She has asked you a number of times not to. Second, Triss is not exaggerating. I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs. On the other ... We have all seen ...'  He fell silent and looked at Ciri who, with a joyful squeal, acknowledged that she had the upper hand in  the game. Triss spied a small smile on Coen's face and was sure he had allowed her to win. 'Precisely,' she sneered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish. Only after-'  He broke off.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing. The magician suddenly realised that she had never, up until now, heard any of the Geralts  laugh.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'Confused. Don't ask about it, Triss. We are not worried by  the contents of Ciri's prophecies and ravings but about what happens to her. We're not afraid for  ourselves but-'  'Careful,' warned Vesemir. 'Don't talk about it in front of her.'  Coen approached the table carrying the girl piggy-back.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"It's  nearly midnight. In a minute it'll be the end of Midinvaerne. As of tomorrow, every day brings spring  closer!'  'I'm thirsty.' Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice. Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect. Ciri suddenly grew rigid, cried out, and smiled a  broad, happy smile.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"A  stick between our teeth, hold us down, wait for it to pass. Chin up, boys. I've done this before.'  Ciri ceased dancing, sank to her knees, extended her arms and rested her head on her lap. Triss pressed  the now warm amulet to her temple and murmured the formula of a spell. She closed her eyes,  concentrated her willpower and gave out a burst of magic.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Everything froze in the silence and stillness. Triss took a step, wanting to make sure she could. She  stopped next to Ciri and saw that both of them stood on the edge of a bottomless chasm where reddish  smoke, glowing as though it was lit from behind, was swirling. The flash of another soundless bolt of  lightning suddenly revealed a long, marble staircase leading into the depths of the abyss. 'It has to be this way,' Ciri said in a shaky voice.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"No ...'  Ciri!'  'No!' The girl turned rigid and squeezed her eyelids shut. 'No, no, I don't want to! Don't touch me!'  Ciri's face suddenly changed, hardened; her voice became metallic, cold and hostile, resounding with  threatening, cruel mockery. 'You have come all this way with her, Triss Merigold? All the way here?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"To emptiness. 'You are wrong, Fourteenth One,' the metallic, inhuman voice sneered. 'You've mistaken the stars  reflected on the surface of the lake at night for the heavens.'  'Do not touch- Do not touch that child!'  'She is not a child.'  Ciri's lips moved but Triss saw that the girl's eyes were dead, glazed and vacant. 'She is not a child,' the voice repeated. 'She is the Flame, the White Flame which will set light to the  world.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Seagulls cried wildly, cried and commanded. Triss? Ciri? Forget about him! Don't torture him!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Overcome your     pride, crush your rancour and obstinacy. There is no point to it, you'll torture yourself to death. And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The thing that wants to possess her might not be  able to reach her in the temple. And then you will ask Yennefer for help.'  'All right, Triss. Thank you.'  'Geralt?'  'Yes.'  'Ciri said something else, didn't she? Something only you heard. Tell me what it was.'  'No,' he protested and his voice quivered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'Geralt.'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Stay with me tonight.'  'Triss ...'  'Only stay.'  'All right.'  Not long after Midinvaerne the snow stopped falling. The frost came. Triss stayed with Ciri day and night. She watched over her. She surrounded her with care, visible and  invisible.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"And finally it passed. It ended, disappeared without a trace. Ciri calmed, she slept peacefully with no nightmares, and no dreams. But Triss kept a constant watch. She did not leave the girl for a moment.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The weather's beautiful!'  'Don't lean out or you'll fall from the window.'  'Let's go sleighing, Triss!'  'Suggest that again in Elder Speech and we'll end the lesson there. Move away from the window, come  back to the table ... Ciri, how many times do I have to ask you? Stop waving that sword about and put  it away.'  'It's my new sword! It's real, a Geralt's sword!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The fingers of her left hand were lightly  touching the pommel. On seeing them, the girl jumped, spun in a pirouette and landed softly in an identical but reverse mirror  position. 'Ciri,' said the Geralt, 'come down, please.'  It seemed she hadn't heard him. She did not move, not even a muscle. Triss, however, saw the reflection  of the moon, thrown across her face by the blade, glisten silver over a stream of tears.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"It fell  accurately upon its victim, and its victim was Triss. Initially it seemed nasty but not too serious, resembling an ordinary stomach upset. Geralt and Ciri  discreetly tried to take no notice of the stops the enchantress's ailment necessitated. Triss, as pale as  death, beaded with sweat and painfully contorted, tried to continue riding for several hours longer, but at  about midday, and having spent an abnormally long time in the bushes by the road, she was no longer in  any condition to sit on a saddle. Ciri tried to help her but to no avail - the enchantress, unable to hold on  to the horse's mane, slid down her mount's flank and collapsed to the ground.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I can't concentrate because of this cramp ...'  'Don't cry.'  'Easy for you to say!'  The Geralt got up, pulled his saddle-bags from Roach's back and began rummaging through them. Triss  curled up, her face contracted and her lips twisted in a spasm of pain. 'Ciri ...'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Do you feel all right? No ... unusual sensations?'  The girl shook her head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The Geralt did not  pursue the question. Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle. Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding. They did not even manage a mile. The enchantress kept falling from Geralt's hands; she could not  stay in the saddle.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'We just got here in  time with the relief troops - otherwise we'd have found nothing here but charred earth.'  'Who were your attackers? Bandits? Marauders?'     The soldier shook his head, spat and looked at Ciri and Triss, huddled in the saddle. 'Come inside,' he said, 'your Enchantress is going to fall out of her saddle any minute now. We already  have some wounded men there; one more won't make much difference.'  In the yard, in an open, roofed shelter, lay several people with their wounds dressed with bloodied  bandages.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'Two guards from here, two of our relief troops and two ... two of the others,' he said, pulling up a  corner of the stiff material. 'Take a look, if you wish.'  'Ciri, step away.'  'I want to see, too!' The girl leaned out around him, staring at the corpses with her mouth open. 'Step away, please. Take care of Triss.'  Ciri huffed, unwilling, but obeyed.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Well, all right. I'll rummage through the bags. I used to have some good medicine for the runs,  maybe there's still a little left.'  'Ciri,' muttered the Geralt, passing her a sheepskin unstrapped from the horse, 'go to sleep, you're  barely on your feet. No, not in the wagon. We'll put Triss in the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"If the young lady will deign to forgive me, I've  brought the medicine and a little food. Will the young lady accept it or will she send the old boor, Yarpen  Zigrin, away?'  'I'm sorry ... Ciri had second thoughts and lowered her head. 'Triss really does need help, Master ... Zigrin.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I've brought you some water and a little food-'  'Thank you. But they both need rest above all. Ciri, lie down.'  'I'll just make up a compress for Triss-'  'I'll do it myself. Yarpen, I'd like to talk to you.'  'Come to the fire. We'll broach a barrel-'  'I want to talk to you.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'Yours?'  'Mine,' he replied without thinking. 'Mine, Zigrin.'  The dawn was grey, wet, and smelled of night rain and morning mist. Ciri felt she had slept no more than  a few minutes, as though she had been woken up the very minute she lay her head down on the sacks  heaped on the wagon. Geralt was just settling Triss down next to her, having brought her in from another enforced expedition  into the woods. The rugs cocooning the enchantress sparkled with dew.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
The rugs cocooning the enchantress sparkled with dew. Geralt had dark circles under his  eyes. Ciri knew he had not closed them for an instant Triss had run a fever through the night and suffered  greatly. 'Did I wake you? Sorry.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I'd like to  'Yes?' The Geralt leaned over but Triss was already asleep. He straightened himself, stretched. 'Geralt,' whispered Ciri, 'are they going to let us travel on the wagon?'  'We'll see.' He bit his lip. 'Sleep while you can. Rest.'  He jumped down off the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Yarpen Zigrin ran the length of the column, giving orders and instructions loudly, after which he  clambered onto the coachman's box, shouted and whipped the horses with the reins. The wagon jolted  and rattled along the forest trail. The bump woke Triss up but Ciri reassured her and changed the  compress on her forehead. The rattling had a soporific effect and the magician was soon asleep; Ciri, too, fell to dozing. When she woke the sun was already high.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'And you're just a nuisance, too, little madam,' he snorted angrily. 'All we need are ladies and girls, damn  it. I can't even take a piss from the box - I have to stop the cart and go into the bushes!'  Ciri put her hands on her hips, shook her ashen fringe and turned up her nose. 'Is that so?' she shrilled, enraged. 'Drink less beer, Zigrin, and then you won't have to!'  'My beer's none of your shitin' business, you chit!'  'Don't yell, Triss has just fallen asleep!'  'It's my wagon!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon. 'But I didn't  want to ... interrupt this interesting conversation.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Triss wants to wash.'  'Go ahead,' agreed Yarpen Zigrin. 'Xavier, take the spit off the fire, our hare's had enough. Hand me the  cauldron, Ciri. Oh, look at you, it's full to the brim! Did you lug this great weight from the stream by  yourself?'  'I'm strong.'  The elder of the Dahlberg brothers burst out laughing.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"When  you're healthy, too, come to that. You remember old Schrader? His wife once told him to wash, and  Schrader went and died soon afterwards.'  'Because a rabid dog bit him.'  'If he hadn't washed, the dog wouldn't have bitten him.'  'I think,' said Ciri, checking the temperature of the water in the cauldron with her finger, 'it's excessive to  wash every day too. But Triss asked for it - she even started crying once ... So Geralt and I-'  'We know.' The elder Dahlberg nodded.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil. We'll infuse some more saffron and poppy seeds for the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her. They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own. They coped exceptionally well - he supported the  enchantress in his arms, Ciri washed and dried her. Only one thing had started to surprise and annoy Ciri    -Triss, in her opinion, snuggled up to Geralt too tightly. This time she was even trying to kiss him. Geralt indicated the magician's saddle-bags with his head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"She found the comb and knelt  down beside her. Triss, lowering her head towards her, put her arms around the Geralt. In Ciri's  opinion, definitely a little too tightly. 'Oh, Geralt,' she sobbed. 'I so regret ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her. He did not need to lean over in  order to do so, as Geralt did.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"During the pogrom.'  *  'Riders!' shouted one of Wenck's advance guards. 'Riders ahead!'  The commissar trotted up to Yarpen's wagon and Geralt approached from the other side. 'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely. 'Get off the box and get in the back! Stay with Triss.'  'I can't see anything from there!'  'Don't argue!' growled Yarpen.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Cloaks and beaver hats can be pretty  quick to change owners.'  The riders approached swiftly. There were about ten of them. Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and  started to drag her towards the overturned wagon. The enchantress moaned, holding her head just above  the ear. Right by Ciri's side, hooves suddenly clattered and horses snorted - two elves, brandishing their  swords, were pressing the madly fighting Yarpen hard. The dwarf spun like a top and agilely deflected  the blows directed against him with his axe. Ciri heard curses, grunts and the whining clang of metal.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"The dwarf fell. At that moment the  flaming wagon crashed into those  still fighting, parting and scattering them. Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"Triss is alive.'  'How is she?'  'She hit her head falling out of the wagon when Yarpen tried to rescue it. But she's fine now. Treating the  wounded.'  Ciri cast her eyes around. Amidst the smoke from the last wagons, burning out, silhouettes of armed men  flickered. And all around lay chests and barrels.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Triss
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"Eskel emanated powerfully. More powerfully than Geralt. 'Triss,' he said, rubbing the hideous scar on his cheek with embarrassment, 'help us. We ask you. Help  us, Triss.'  The enchantress looked him in the eye and pursed her lips.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back. 'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried. 'But we've already promised to ease Ciri's training, Triss. What  other conditions do you want to impose?'  'Well, maybe  conditions  isn't a very nice phrase.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"She might hold it against you later if you so ruthlessly deprive her of her  womanly ... attributes. Do you understand what I'm saying?'  'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her  dress. Eskel cleared his throat and looked daggers at the young Geralt. 'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed  anything irreversible in her, I hope?'  'No.' She smiled.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic. On such a night as Midinvaerne,  when the air itself was vibrating with magic, the Geralts' medallions must be practically humming. It must  be both irritating and bothersome.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"Not even the Chapter. Why are  you looking at me like that?'  'We're amazed by the ease with which you pledge to keep this secret,' said Eskel calmly. 'Forgive me,  Triss, I do not mean to offend you, but what has happened to your legendary loyalty to the Council and  Chapter?'  'A lot has happened. The war changed many things, and the battle for Sodden Hill changed even more. I  won't bore you with  the politics, especially as certain issues and affairs are bound by secrets I am not allowed to divulge.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly. 'Did you think to impress me?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"'Senseless drivel.'  'Then I have no doubt' - she looked straight at him - 'that you understood each other perfectly well. Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"As of tomorrow, every day brings spring  closer!'  'I'm thirsty.' Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice. Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"About their approaching departure for  the Trail. About what the Trail would have in store for them - about vampires, wyverns, leshys,  lycanthropes and basilisks. This time it was Triss who began to yawn and stare at the ceiling. This time she was the one who  remained silent - until Eskel turned to her with a question. A question which she had anticipated.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Eskel
"Sing to us of what happened next!'  'Songs and ballads' the musician bowed - 'never end, dear lady, because poetry is eternal and immortal,  it knows no beginning, it knows no end-'  'But what happened next?' The tradeswoman didn't give up, generously rattling coins into the bucket  Dandelion's apprentice held out to her. 'At least tell us about it, even if you have no wish to sing of it. Your songs mention no names, but we know the Geralt you sing of is no other than the famous Geralt of  Rivia, and the enchantress for whom he burns with love is the equally famous Yennefer. And the Child  Surprise, destined for the Geralt and sworn to him from birth, is Ciri, the unfortunate Princess of  Cintra, the town destroyed by the Invaders. Am I right?'  Dandelion smiled, remaining enigmatic and aloof.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Of emotions which anyone can experience. Not about specific people.'  'Oh, come on!' yelled a voice from the crowd. 'Everyone knows those songs are about Geralt the  Geralt!'  'Yes, yes!' squealed Baron Vilibert's daughters in chorus, drying their sodden scarves. 'Sing on, Master  Dandelion! What happened next?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"'You have understood nothing of Master Dandelion's ballad, you have learned nothing! You did not see that these ballads speak of man's fate, that we are no more than toys in the hands of the  gods, our lands no more than their playground. The ballads about destiny portrayed the destinies of us all,  and the legend of Geralt the Geralt and Princess Ciri - although it is set against the true background  of that war - is, after all, a mere metaphor, the creation of a poet's imagination designed to help us-'  'You're talking rubbish, holy man!' hollered Vera Loewenhaupt from the heights of her cart. 'What  legend? What imaginative creation?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"This is no legend or fairy-tale. It is the truth,  the sincere truth, which Master Dandelion sang for us.'  'I second that,' said a slender female warrior with her black hair smoothly brushed back and plaited into a  thick braid. 'I, Rayla of Lyria, also know Geralt the White Wolf, the famous slayer of monsters. And I've  met the enchantress, Lady Yennefer, on several occasions -I used to visit Aedirn and her home town of  Vengerberg. I don't know anything about their being in love, though.'

"'Calanthe's granddaughter. She was not the princess herself, but the daughter of the Princess of Cintra. She was the Child Surprise destined for the Geralt, the man to whom - even before she was born - the  queen had sworn to hand her granddaughter over to, just as Master Dandelion has sung. But the Geralt  could neither find her nor collect her. And here our poet has missed the truth.'  'Oh yes, he's missed the truth indeed,' butted in a sinewy young man who, judging by his clothes, was a  journeyman on his travels prior to crafting his masterpiece and passing his master's exams.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Whereas in your ballad you so vividly and touchingly described her meeting a strange,  almost legendary individual, the ... Geralt ... Geralt, or Gerald. Leaving the poetic drivel about destiny  and the decrees of fate aside, from the rest of the ballad it seems the child survived the Battle of Cintra in  one piece. Is that true?'  'I don't know ...' moaned Dandelion.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"But you are beating about the  bush. You wouldn't have thought the ballad up just like that, not without reason. And you do know the  Geralt, after all. You have often been seen in his company. So talk, Dandelion, if you treasure your  joints.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"She slipped the  roast chicken onto a trencher and began dividing it skilfully, She used a knife and fork. Dandelion had  only known one person, up until then, who could eat a chicken with a knife and fork as skilfully. Now he  knew how, and from whom, Geralt had learnt the knack. Well, he thought, no wonder. After all, he did  live with her for a year in Vengerberg and before he left her, she had instilled a number of strange things  into him.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Those you were asked in the pigsty while your arms were being twisted out of their sockets. What really  happened, Dandelion? Have you really not seen Geralt since you fled the banks of the Yaruga? Did you  really not know he returned south after the war? That he was seriously wounded -so seriously there were  even rumours of his death?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"'... or perhaps you listened to someone's confidences and grievances?'  'Hmm ...' Dandelion cleared his throat and veered away from the dangerous subject. 'Tell me, Yennefer,  when did you last see Geralt?'  'A long time ago.'  'After the war?'  After the war ...' Yennefer's voice changed a little. 'No, I never saw him after the war. For a long time  ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Warned that the likes of Rience are looking for him and the little  girl? I would go, but I honestly don't know where it is ... That place whose name I prefer not to say ...'  'Get to the point, Dandelion.'     'If you know where Geralt is, you ought to go and warn him. You owe him that, Yennefer. There was,  after all, something between you.'  'Yes,' she acknowledged coldly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Don't  play at being a hero. You have got yourself mixed up in a dangerous affair, Dandelion.'  'I've noticed.' He grimaced and rubbed his aching shoulder. 'And that is precisely why I believe Geralt  should be warned. You are the only one who knows where to look for him. You know the way.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"We can spare ourselves the  rhetoric and slick eloquence which leads nowhere when the matter at hand is so simple and trivial.'  'Ah, even so.' Dijkstra smiled. 'Trivial. A dangerous Nilfgaardian agent, who could now be trivially  locked away in my deepest dungeon in Tretogor, has trivially escaped, trivially warned and frightened  away by the trivial stupidity of two gentlemen known as Dandelion and Geralt. I've seen people wander to  the scaffolds over lesser trivialities. Why didn't you inform me about your ambush, Dandelion?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Your Geralt, however,' suddenly snarled the spy, 'underestimated Master Rience. He set a trap but demonstrating  a complete lack of common sense - banked on Rience troubling himself to come in  person. Rience, according to the Geralt's plan, was to feel safe. Rience wasn't to smell a trap anywhere,  wasn't to spy Master Dijkstra's subordinates lying in wait for him. Because, on the Geralt's instructions,  Master Dandelion had not squealed to Master Dijkstra about the planned ambush.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"I have to talk to him. Personally, and without  witnesses. Without the noise and publicity which would arise if I were to arrest the Geralt. Bring him to  me, Dandelion. That's all I require of you at present.'  'Geralt has left,' the bard lied calmly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"When he's back,  bring him here. The sooner the better. Better for many people.'  'There might be a few difficulties,' Dandelion grimaced, 'in convincing Geralt to come here. He - just  imagine it - harbours an inexplicable aversion to spies. Although to all intents and purposes he seems to  understand it is a job like any other, he feels repulsion for those who execute it.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"My colleagues, men belonging to King  Foltest's secret service, are also, as it turns out, interested in Master Rience. They saw through the plan  of those - as you called them - crafty dogs. It is they who boarded the barge, they who wanted to grab  the Geralt. Perhaps as bait for Rience, perhaps for a different end. At Acorn Bay, Dandelion, the Geralt  killed Temerian agents.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"At Acorn Bay, Dandelion, the Geralt  killed Temerian agents. Their chief is very, very angry. You say Geralt has left? I hope he hasn't gone to  Temeria. He might never return.'  And that's what you have on him?'  'Indeed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"I can pacify the Temerians. But not for nothing. Where has the Geralt gone,  Dandelion?'  'Novigrad,' the troubadour lied without thinking. 'He went to look for Rience there.'  A mistake, a mistake,' smiled the spy, pretending not to have caught the lie. 'You see what a shame it is  he didn't overcome his repulsion and get in touch with me.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Maybe I can answer them?'  'Don't make me laugh, Dandelion.'  'Yet,' Philippa Eilhart said suddenly, 'perhaps he can? Maybe he can save us time? Don't forget, Dijkstra,  our poet is mixed up to his ears in this affair and we've got him here but we haven't got the Geralt. Where is the child seen with Geralt in Kaedwen? The girl with ashen hair and green eyes?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Eh, Dandelion? What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"But I really don't know what you're talking  about. I've never seen the child you're so interested in. And Geralt-'  'Geralt,' interrupted Dijkstra, 'never confided in you, never said a word even though, no doubt, you  inundated him with questions. Why do you think that might be, Dandelion? Could it be that this simple  soul, this simpleton who despises spies, sensed who you really are?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"He knows shit-all, don't be taken in by his cocksure expressions and ambiguous smirks. He can help us in only one way. When the Geralt emerges from his hide-out, he'll get in touch with him,  no one else. Just imagine, he considers him to be a friend.'  Dandelion slowly raised his head. 'Indeed,' he confirmed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Perched precariously on the guttering, Dandelion knocked on the lead frames. The window was  not locked and gave way at the slightest push. 'Geralt! Hey, Geralt!'  'Dandelion? Wait ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"'May the-'  'No comments, thank you very much.' The Geralt sat down on the bed. And Shani covered herself,  yanking the sheet right up to her upturned nose. 'Well, come in then.' Geralt reached for his trousers. 'Since you're coming by way of the window, this  must be important. Because if it isn't I'm going to throw you straight back out through it.'  Dandelion clambered off the sill, knocking down the rest of the onions.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Because if it isn't I'm going to throw you straight back out through it.'  Dandelion clambered off the sill, knocking down the rest of the onions. He sat down, pulling the  high-backed, wooden chair closer with his foot. The Geralt gathered Shani's clothes and his own from  the floor. He looked abashed and dressed in silence. The medical student, hiding behind him, was  struggling with her shirt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"The medical student, hiding behind him, was  struggling with her shirt. The poet watched her insolently, searching in his mind for similes and rhymes for  the golden colour of her skin in the light of the oil lamp and the curves of her small breasts. 'What's this about, Dandelion?' The Geralt fastened the buckles on his boots. 'Go on.'  'Pack your bags,' he replied dryly. 'Your departure is imminent.'  'How imminent?'  'Exceptionally.'  'Shani ...' Geralt cleared his throat.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Tretogor? Dijkstra?'  'You've guessed.'  'That's still no reason-'  'It's reason enough,' interrupted Dandelion. 'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt. They're after the girl and Yennefer. Dijkstra wants to know where they are.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"A big grey owl glided down to the sill without a sound. Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"The magician  immediately jumped into the room, smoothing down her hair and clothes. 'Good evening,' she said coldly. 'Introduce me, Dandelion.'  'Geralt of Rivia. Shani of Medicine. And that owl which so craftily flew in my tracks is no owl.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"It's a shame we've only got one chair in here.'  'It's quite enough.' The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by  Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani. The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed. 'In principle, what I've come about is the sole concern of Geralt of Rivia,' Philippa began after a short  pause. 'I'm aware, however, that to ask anybody to leave would be tactless, and so ...'  'I can leave,' said Shani hesitantly. 'You can't,' muttered Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Sometimes - as in this particular instance - I am  not allowed to tell the king outright that he is committing a mistake, or to dissuade him from a hasty  action. I simply have to render it impossible for him to make a mistake. You understand what I'm saying?'  The Geralt confirmed with a nod. Dandelion wondered whether he really did understand, because he  knew that Philippa was lying through her teeth. 'So I see,' said Geralt slowly, proving that he understood perfectly well, 'that the Council of Wizards is  also interested in my ward.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"And guard that child, damn it! Guard that girl as though she's the apple of  your eye! And if you can't do so yourself, ask others to!'  For a moment Dandelion thought the Geralt was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer. He    would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Philippa knew everything. Philippa was warning him. And the Geralt understood her  warning. He concentrated on observing their eyes and faces, wondering whether by any chance something in the  past had tied the two together. Dandelion knew that similar duels of words and allusions -demonstrating a  mutual fascination - waged between the Geralt and enchantresses very often ended in bed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Dandelion knew that similar duels of words and allusions -demonstrating a  mutual fascination - waged between the Geralt and enchantresses very often ended in bed.

"He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the  charlatan's house. Rience retreated into the depths of the lane, raising and spreading  both arms in front of him, a magical light already beginning to exude from them. Geralt grasped his sword  with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him. The sorcerer's nerves could not take it. Without completing his spell, he began to run away, yelling incomprehensibly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"I'm a medical student, Dandelion! Let me go, do  you hear?'  'You can't help them,' replied Dandelion in a dull voice. 'Not after a Geralt's sword ... Don't even go  there. Don't look ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane. And knows perfectly well what she's doing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Because I did this precisely so as not to  betray a cause which is greater than you can imagine. A great and important cause, so important that  minor matters have to be sacrificed for it without second thoughts, if faced with such a choice. Geralt,    damn it, we're nattering and you're standing in a pool of blood. Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here!",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion
"Choose, as  your Yennefer had to. Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion

'You and your great cause ...' The Geralt, ignoring the troubadour, staggered forward. 'Your great  cause, Philippa, and your choice, is a wounded man, stabbed in cold blood once he told you what you  wanted to know, but what I wasn't to find out. Your great cause is Rience, whom you allowed to escape  so that he wouldn't by any chance reveal the name of his patron.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Dandelion

"'Two proved enough. But still complicated, I must admit.'  'Such foul weather everywhere?'  'Everywhere.'  'So let us fortify ourselves with good fare and an old red wine from Cidaris. Lydia, would you be so  kind?'  Lydia van Bredevoort, Vilgefortz's assistant and personal secretary, appeared from behind the curtain  like an ethereal phantom and smiled with her eyes at Tissaia de Vries. Tissaia, controlling her face,  replied with a pleasant smile and bow of her head. Artaud Terranova stood up and bowed with  reverence.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"Tissaia de Vries ate slowly, devoting more attention to arranging her plates,  cutlery and napkins symmetrically - although, in her opinion, they still lay irregularly and hurt her  predilection for order and her aesthetic sensibility - than to the fare. She drank sparingly. Vilgefortz ate  and drank even more sparingly. Lydia, of course, did not drink or eat at all. The candle flames undulated in long red and golden whiskers of fire.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"Vilgefortz of  Roggeveen was well known for his love of solving such problems. They sat down in carved ebony armchairs. Lydia glanced at Vilgefortz, caught the sign transmitted by his  eye and immediately left. Tissaia sighed imperceptibly. Everyone knew that Lydia van Bredevoort was in love with Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, that she had loved  him for years with a silent, relentless and stubborn love.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"This is mass murder. Are we to say to Gedymdeith and Enid  Findabair that you advise us to stand idly by, to watch and do nothing? Pretending we can't see  anything?'  Vilgefortz turned his head towards her. Now you're going to change tactics, thought Tissaia. You're a  player, you can hear which way the dice roll on the table.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"You're going to change tactics. You're going to  strike a different note. Vilgefortz did not lower his eyes from hers. 'You are right,' he said curtly. 'You are right, Tissaia.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia

Tissaia sensed the  thought, the impulse  leaping from the workbench and magical apparatus to the two volumes lying on the table.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"The Blood of Elves?'  'Tissaia? And what do you think?'  'I second it.' The enchantress adjusted her ring which had turned the wrong way round. 'I second  Vilgefortz's plan. Let us call a convention. As soon as possible.'  Metal, stone, crystal, she thought.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"The reasons tend to be  quite trivial ...'  Tissaia looked at him, pursing her lips. The wizard fell silent. Vilgefortz smiled faintly. 'Precisely,' he said. 'That is just what I thought.",Blood of Elves,Vilgefortz,Tissaia
"Growing  taller and wider it became a door beyond which was a faint glow, the flickering brightness of torches  stuck in iron mounts on the walls. A black figure stood framed in the door, blurred by the brightness. 'Who comes?' Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark. 'Geralt?'    'Yes, Eskel. It's me.'  'Come in.'  The Geralt dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into  her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind  completely.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"'Wait here with Eskel,' he said. 'I'll take Roach to the stables.'  'Come into the light, laddie,' growled the man called Eskel. 'Don't lurk in the dark.'  Ciri looked up into his face and barely restrained her frightened scream. He wasn't human. Although he  stood on two legs, although he smelled of sweat and smoke, although he wore ordinary human clothes,  he was not human.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"Something  soft and squeaking ran over her foot. She jumped. 'Don't loiter in the dark, or the rats will eat your boots.'  Still clinging to her bundle Ciri moved briskly towards the light. The rats bolted out from beneath her feet  with a squeak. Eskel leaned over, took the package from her and pulled back her hood.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"She saw that he was human after all, that he had an  entirely human face, deformed by a long, ugly, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth  across the length of his cheek up to the ear. 'Since you're here, welcome to Kaer Morhen,' he said. 'What do they call you?'  'Ciri,' Geralt replied for her, silently emerging from the darkness. Eskel turned around. Suddenly, quickly,  wordlessly, the Geralts fell into each other's arms and wound their shoulders around each other tight and  hard.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"I'm closing the inner gates to stop the heat  escaping.'  They walked along the corridor. There were rats here, too; they flitted under the walls, squeaked from  the dark abyss, from the branching passages, and skittered before the swaying circle of light thrown by  the torch. Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"'Welcome and come in,' said Eskel. 'It is as cold and blustery as if someone has hung themselves. Ciri,  where are you off to? The invitation does not apply to you. The sun is still high, even if it is obscured.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well. They had drunk cider, but the girl had been given water and was clearly both astonished and  revolted by it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"I am ...'  She looked at the enchantress. Triss winked at her, smirking like a rascal well pleased with his mischief,  and moved her lips to prompt the memorised lines. 'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling. Vesemir hawked again. But Eskel, dear Eskel, kept his head and once more behaved as was fitting.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"'Thank you,' he said. 'Thank you, Triss.'    'Conditions?' Eskel was clearly worried. 'But we've already promised to ease Ciri's training, Triss. What  other conditions do you want to impose?'  'Well, maybe  conditions  isn't a very nice phrase. So let us call it advice.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"You don't take talented children from their parents and guardians any  more. You observe such children so that later - at the right moment - you can fascinate them in magic,  influence them-'  'Have no fear,' she interrupted coldly. 'I will not tell anyone about Ciri. Not even the Chapter. Why are  you looking at me like that?'  'We're amazed by the ease with which you pledge to keep this secret,' said Eskel calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"She has asked you a number of times not to. Second, Triss is not exaggerating. I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs. On the other ... We have all seen ...'  He fell silent and looked at Ciri who, with a joyful squeal, acknowledged that she had the upper hand in  the game.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"Drivel is your speciality -and I am further convinced of it every time you open your mouth. Do me a great  favour and don't open it for a while, all right?'  'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss. After drinking  Seagull Ciri really was incomprehensible. That first time it was gibberish. Only after-'  He broke off.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"It's  nearly midnight. In a minute it'll be the end of Midinvaerne. As of tomorrow, every day brings spring  closer!'  'I'm thirsty.' Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice. Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect. Ciri suddenly grew rigid, cried out, and smiled a  broad, happy smile.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Eskel
"Sit on the chair. Just a  moment, wait, I'll take those books ... Does Lady Yennefer know you're here?'  'No.'  'Hmm ... Or Mother Nenneke?'  Ciri pulled a face. She knew what he meant.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"And whispers. Yennefer. 'Magician Yennefer. Quick, Ciri, hurry up. Mother Nenneke is waiting.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"She only looked at me and behind her,  in the darkness, I saw a closed door ... Ciri sighed. Yennefer turned and the obsidian star on her neck glittered with a thousand reflections. 'You're right,' admitted the girl seriously, looking straight into the magician's violet eyes. 'I didn't like you.'  'Ciri,' said Nenneke, 'come closer.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"It would be a sin  to waste it.'  Ciri could barely keep her hands from shaking; she swallowed hard and looked inquiringly at Nenneke. The high priestess was serious, as if sad, and the smile with which she answered the unspoken question  was unpleasantly false. 'You're going with Lady Yennefer now,' she said. 'Lady Yennefer is going to be looking after you for a  while.'  Ciri bowed her head and clenched her teeth. 'You are no doubt baffled,' continued Nenneke, 'that a Mistress of Wizardry is suddenly taking you into  her care.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"You used to come to me, after those  dreams, after the nocturnal disturbances in the dormitory. I couldn't help you. But Lady Yennefer-'  'Lady Yennefer,' interrupted the magician, 'will do what is necessary. Let us go, girl.'  'Go,' nodded Nenneke, trying, in vain, to make her smile at least appear natural. 'Go, child.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"'Please, be kind-hearted and understanding. She really is not who you take her to be.'  'What do you mean by that?'  'She's not your rival, Yennefer.'  For a moment they measured each other with their eyes, the enchantress and the priestess, and Ciri felt  the air quiver, a strange, terrible force between them growing in strength. This lasted no more than a  fraction of a second after which the force disappeared and Yennefer burst out laughing, lightheartedly and  sweetly. 'I forgot,' she said. 'Always on his side, aren't you, Nenneke?",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"I am ... Who? 'You, on the other hand, Nenneke,' retorted the magician, 'are amusing yourself, as usual, analysing other  people's emotions, and on top of that interpreting them to suit yourself!'  'And pulling my nose into other people's business?'  'I didn't want to say that.' Yennefer tossed her black locks, which gleamed and writhed like snakes. 'Thank you for doing so for me, And now let us change the subject, please, because the one we were  discussing is exceptionally silly - disgraceful in front of our young pupil. And as for being understanding,  as you ask ...",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"That is why I have brought you here, Ciri - to show you that force. Tomorrow, I am going to start giving it to you.'  Long, arduous days followed, days of intensive study and exhausting work. Yennefer was firm, frequently  stern, sometimes masterfully formidable. But she was never boring. Previously, Ciri could barely keep  her eyes open in the Temple school and would  sometimes even doze off during a lesson, lulled by the monotonous, gentle voice of Nenneke, Iola the  First, Hrosvitha or some other teacher.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Written in Elder Speech, which the girl already knew to perfection, they sank easily into her  memory. Nor did she have any problems enunciating the frequently complicated intonations. Yennefer  was clearly pleased and, from day to day, was becoming more pleasant and sympathetic. More and  more frequently, taking breaks in the studies, both gossiped and joked about any old thing; both even  began to amuse themselves by delicately poking fun at Nenneke who often 'visited' their lectures and  exercises - bristling and puffed up like a brooding hen - ready to take Ciri under her protective wing, to  protect and save her from the magician's imagined severity and the 'inhuman tortures' of her education. Obeying instructions, Ciri moved to Yennefer's chamber.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Nenneke, who, of course knew about everything, saw to it  that to the other priestesses and the novices Ciri was exceptionally ordinary, an illegitimate daughter of a  knight and a peasant woman, a child for whom there had been no place either in her father's castle or her  mother's cottage. Half of the novices in Melitele's Temple were just such children. And Yennefer too knew the secret. She was the one who 'could be trusted'. Yennefer asked.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Is it right to do that? Mother Nenneke taught us that we mustn't  take anything just like that, for the fun of it. Even the cherry has to be left on its tree for the birds, so that  it can simply fall.'  Yennefer put her arm around Ciri, kissed her gently on the hair at her temple. 'I wish,' she muttered, 'others could hear what you said. Vil-gefortz, Francesca, Terranova ...",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Hold the handkerchief. I'll just conjure up some ice ...'  There was a great fuss about that small amount of blood. Yennefer and Nenneke did not talk to each  other for a week. For a week, Ciri lazed around, read books and got bored because the magician had put her studies on  hold. The girl did not see her for entire days - Yennefer disappeared somewhere at dawn, returned in the  evening, looked at her strangely and was oddly taciturn.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Hurt with the strange sort of  pain oddly associated with bliss. To relax, they once again ran around the park. Yennefer persuaded Nenneke to take Ciri's sword out of  storage and so enabled the girl to practise her steps, dodges and attacks - in secret, of course, to prevent  the other priestesses and novices seeing her. But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"The planks just  need to be cleared away. They'll make good firewood!'  During the warm, still afternoons the air grew thick with the scent of flowers and grass; pulsating with  peace and silence, broken by the buzz of bees and enormous beetles. On afternoons like this Yennefer  carried Nenneke's wicker chair out into the garden and sat in it, stretching her legs out in front of her. Sometimes she studied books, sometimes read letters which she received by means of strange couriers,  usually birds. At times she simply sat gazing into the distance.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
No words. Humid. 'Lady Yennefer!'  What now?'  'There's a spider crawling towards your leg! Look how hideous it is!'  'A spider's a spider.'  'Kill it!'  'I can't be bothered to bend over.'  'Then kill it with magic!'  'On the grounds of Melitele's Temple? So that Nenneke can throw us out head first?,Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"Both were armed. Only Nenneke saw them off. She spoke quietly and at length with Yennefer, then they both - the  magician and the priestess -shook each other's hand, hard, like men. Ciri, holding the reins of her  dapple-grey mare, wanted to say goodbye in the same way, but Nenneke did not allow it. She embraced  her, hugged her and gave her a kiss.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"May the Great  Melitele protect you on your way, my dears. But the goddess has a great many things on her mind, so  look after yourselves too. Take care of her, Yennefer. Keep her safe, like the apple of your eye.'  'I hope' - the magician smiled faintly - 'that I'll manage to keep her safer.'  Across the sky, towards Pontar Valley, flew flocks of crows, croaking loudly. Nenneke did not look at  them.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Nenneke
"'At least tell us about it, even if you have no wish to sing of it. Your songs mention no names, but we know the Geralt you sing of is no other than the famous Geralt of  Rivia, and the enchantress for whom he burns with love is the equally famous Yennefer. And the Child  Surprise, destined for the Geralt and sworn to him from birth, is Ciri, the unfortunate Princess of  Cintra, the town destroyed by the Invaders. Am I right?'  Dandelion smiled, remaining enigmatic and aloof. 'I sing of universal matters, my dear, generous lady,' he  stated.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"And I've  met the enchantress, Lady Yennefer, on several occasions -I used to visit Aedirn and her home town of  Vengerberg. I don't know anything about their being in love, though.'  'But it has to be true,' the attractive elf in the ermine toque   You did not see that these ballads speak of man's fate, that we are no more than toys in the hands of the  gods, our lands no more than their playground. The ballads about destiny portrayed the destinies of us all,  and the legend of Geralt the Geralt and Princess Ciri - although it is set against the true background  of that war - is, after all, a mere metaphor, the creation of a poet's imagination designed to help us-'  'You're talking rubbish, holy man!' hollered Vera Loewenhaupt from the heights of her cart. 'What  legend? What imaginative creation?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Overcome your     pride, crush your rancour and obstinacy. There is no point to it, you'll torture yourself to death. And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The thing that wants to possess her might not be  able to reach her in the temple. And then you will ask Yennefer for help.'  'All right, Triss. Thank you.'  'Geralt?'  'Yes.'  'Ciri said something else, didn't she? Something only you heard. Tell me what it was.'  'No,' he protested and his voice quivered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Ciri also felt sleepy but was brought to her senses by Yarpen's chuckle, as he reminded Geralt of their  past adventures. This one concerned a hunt for a golden dragon who instead of allowing itself to be  hunted down had counted the hunters' bones and then eaten  a cobbler called Goatmuncher. Ciri began to listen with greater interest. Geralt asked about what had happened to the Slashers but Yarpen didn't know. Yarpen, in turn, was  curious about a woman called Yennefer, at which Geralt grew oddly uncommunicative.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her. He did not need to lean over in  order to do so, as Geralt did.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
A black burgee dotted with silver  lilies fluttered lazily from its mast. The crew consisted of several men wearing the pointed hats of  Temerian Guards. Geralt quickly reached into his bag and pulled out both letters -the one from Ciri and the one from  Yennefer. He swiftly tore them into tiny shreds and threw them into the river. The customs officer  watched him in silence.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"You're torturing that child  mercilessly, forcing her to try things which she can't possibly do. You've no heart. 'You really have no heart, Yennefer.'  Ciri pricked up her ears, wanting to hear the enchantress's reply, her cold, hard and melodious voice. Wanting to hear how she reacted, how she sneered at the high priestess, how she ridiculed her  over-protectiveness. She wanted to hear her say what she usually said - that using magic is no joke, that  it isn't an occupation for young ladies made of porcelain, for dolls blown from thin glass.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer was holding her by the hand. They were both walking  down a long, dark corridor, between stone columns or, perhaps, statues. Ciri could not make out their  forms in the thick darkness. But there was someone there, in that darkness, someone hiding and  observing them as they walked. She heard whispers, quiet as the rustle of the wind.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"An  infinite number of doors with gigantic, heavy leaves opened up before them noiselessly. The darkness thickened. Ciri saw yet another great door in front of her. Yennefer did not slow her stride  but Ciri suddenly knew that this door would not open of its own accord. And she suddenly had an  overwhelming certainty that this door must not be opened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"That, behind  this door, something was waiting for her ... She stopped short, tried to pull away, but Yennefer's hand was strong and unyielding and unrelentingly  dragged her forward. And Ciri finally understood that she had been betrayed, deceived, sold out. That,  ever since the first meeting, from the very beginning, from the first day, she had been no more than a  marionette, a puppet on a string. She tugged harder, tore herself away from that grip.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
She was drenched in sweat; the dull pain was ringing and throbbing in her temples again. Yennefer was  sitting beside on the bed. Her head was turned away so that Ciri did not see her face. She saw only the  tempest of black hair. 'I had a dream ...' whispered Ciri.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Not for show. Eh, Iola? It's exactly as if I were hearing  that hag Yennefer talk!'  'Ciri is getting more and more like her,' appraised Iola, sniffing ostentatiously. 'She even smells like her. Huh, no doubt some magical scent made of mandrake or ambergris.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Just a  moment, wait, I'll take those books ... Does Lady Yennefer know you're here?'  'No.'  'Hmm ... Or Mother Nenneke?'  Ciri pulled a face. She knew what he meant. The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward,  being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The army is marching the  highways out of boredom? Don't twist things, Jarre. You visit the town and castle, you must know    something!'  'Why don't you ask Lady Yennefer about it?'  'Lady Yennefer has more important things to worry about!' Ciri spat, but then immediately had second  thoughts, smiled pleasantly and fluttered her eyelashes. 'Oh, Jarre, tell me, please! You're so clever!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Jarre! Stop  that immediately!'  The boy abruptly pulled his lips away from her hair and went as red as a beetroot. '1 do not wish you to do that to me!'  'Ciri, I '  'I came to you with a serious matter, as a wizard to a scholar,' she said icily and with dignity, in a tone of  voice which exactly copied that of Yennefer. 'So behave!'  The 'scholar' blushed an even deeper shade and had such a stupid expression on his face that the 'wizard'  could barely keep herself from laughing. He leaned over the map once more.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Have a safe journey. I'll ... I'll be thinking of you ...'  Ciri sighed. 'I'm here, Lady Yennefer!'  She flew into the chamber like a shot from a catapult and the door thumped open, slamming against the  wall. She could have broken her legs on the stool standing in her way but Ciri jumped  over it deftly, gracefully executed a half-pirouette feigning the slash of a sword, and joyfully laughed at her  successful trick.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Grabbing the soap, she started to energetically scrub her forearms. Yennefer sat motionless, staring at the window and toying with her comb. Ciri snorted, spluttered and  spat because soap had got into her mouth. She tossed her head wandering whether a spell existed which  could make washing possible without water, soap and wasting time. The magician put the comb aside but, lost in thought, kept gazing through the window at the swarms of  ravens and crows croaking horrifically as they flew east.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The magician put the comb aside but, lost in thought, kept gazing through the window at the swarms of  ravens and crows croaking horrifically as they flew east. On the table, next to the mirror and an  impressive array of bottled cosmetics, lay several letters. Ciri knew that Yennefer had been waiting for  them a long time and that the day on which they were to leave the Temple depended on her receiving  these letters. In spite of what she had told Jarre, the girl had no idea where and why they were leaving. But in those letters ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'I thought ...' She cleared her throat. 'I thought one of them might be from Geralt ...'  'If it was, I'd have given it to you.' The magician turned in her chair and sat facing her. 'Are you going to  be long washing?'  'I've finished.'  'Get up, please.'  Ciri obeyed. Yennefer smiled faintly. 'Yes,' she said, 'you've finished with childhood.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Physiologically, that is to say. Surely you've not forgotten  what we talked about?'  'No. I haven't.'  When you visit Jarre I hope there aren't any problems with your memory either?'  Ciri lowered her eyes, but only momentarily. Yennefer did not smile. 'Dry yourself and come here,' she said coolly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"That boy slobbers and stammers at the sight of you. Can't you see that?'  'That's not my fault! What am I supposed to do?'  Yennefer stopped combing Ciri's hair and measured her with a deep, violet gaze. 'Don't toy with him. It's base.'  'But I'm not toying with him!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"there might be a war? Everybody's talking about another war! Everybody's talking     about it, Lady Yennefer.'  'Indeed,' the magician confirmed coolly, snipping her scissors just above Ciri's ear. 'It's a subject which  belongs to the so-called interminable category. There's been talk about wars in the past, there is talk now  and there always will be.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I don't know what to think myself any more. I don't know what these analogies are,  probably something terribly clever ... Jarre reads various learned books and knows it all, but I think ...'  'It interests me, what you think, Ciri.'  'In Cintra ... That time ... Lady Yennefer, my grandmother was much cleverer than Jarre.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"He sailed the seas, saw everything, even a narwhal and sea serpent, and I bet he also  saw many an analogy. And so what? Suddenly they appeared, the Nilfgaardians ...'  Ciri raised her head and her voice stuck in her throat. Yennefer put her arms around her and hugged her  tightly. 'Unfortunately,' she said quietly, 'unfortunately, you're right, my ugly one.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'And I'm going to be with you, Ciri. Always. I promise  you.'  Ciri sniffed again. Yennefer coughed quietly, put down the scissors and comb, got to her feet and  crossed over to the window. The ravens were still croaking in their flight towards the mountains.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer. 'Magician Yennefer. Quick, Ciri, hurry up. Mother Nenneke is waiting. And she is waiting.'  I knew immediately, thought Ciri, that it was her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"She didn't say anything in my dream. She only looked at me and behind her,  in the darkness, I saw a closed door ... Ciri sighed. Yennefer turned and the obsidian star on her neck glittered with a thousand reflections. 'You're right,' admitted the girl seriously, looking straight into the magician's violet eyes.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Lady Yennefer knows who you are. You can trust her.'  The girl bowed, interlocking her palms in a gesture of full respect. The enchantress, rustling her long,  black dress, approached, took Ciri by the chin and quite off-handedly lifted her head, turning it right and  left. The girl felt anger and rebellion rising within her - she was not used to being treated this way. And at  the same time, she experienced a burning envy.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"And at  the same time, she experienced a burning envy. Yennefer was very beautiful. Compared to the delicate,  pale and rather common comeliness of the priestesses and novices who Ciri saw every day, the magician     glowed with a conscious, even demonstrative loveliness, emphasised and accentuated in every detail. Her  raven-black locks cascading down her shoulders shone, reflected the light like the feathers of a peacock,  curling and undulating with every move. Ciri suddenly felt ashamed, ashamed of her grazed elbows,  chapped hands, broken nails, her ashen, stringy hair.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"And  those two mounds which rose with every breath, hugged by black cloth and white lace ... 'So this is the famous Surprise.' The magician twisted her lips a little. 'Look me in the eyes, girl.'  Ciri shuddered and hunched her shoulders. No, she did not envy Yennefer that one thing - did not desire  to have it or even look at it. Those eyes, violet, deep as a fathomless lake, strangely bright, dispassionate  and malefic.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"An elven great-grandfather or great-grandmother. Have I guessed correctly?'  'I don't know her family tree,' the high priestess replied calmly. 'It didn't interest me.'  'Tall for her age,' continued the magician, still appraising Ciri with her eyes. The girl was boiling over with  fury and annoyance, struggling with an overpowering desire to scream defiantly, scream her lungs out,  stamp her feet and run off to the park, on the way knocking over the vase on the table and slamming the  door so as to make the plaster crumble from the ceiling. 'Not badly developed.' Yennefer did not take her eyes off her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Well, come on, girl. We don't have much time. It would be a sin  to waste it.'  Ciri could barely keep her hands from shaking; she swallowed hard and looked inquiringly at Nenneke. The high priestess was serious, as if sad, and the smile with which she answered the unspoken question  was unpleasantly false. 'You're going with Lady Yennefer now,' she said.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Lady Yennefer is going to be looking after you for a  while.'  Ciri bowed her head and clenched her teeth. 'You are no doubt baffled,' continued Nenneke, 'that a Mistress of Wizardry is suddenly taking you into  her care. But you are a reasonable girl, Ciri. You can guess why. You have inherited certain ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Remember it     is a great privilege to have someone like Lady Yennefer look after you. Don't bring shame on the Temple  and us, your mentors. And be obedient.'  I'll escape tonight, Ciri made up her mind. Back to Kaer Morhen. I'll steal a horse from the stables and  that's the last they'll see of me.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I'll have to take her firmly in hand, file her claws.'  'Be more understanding.' The high priestess's features visibly  hardened. 'Please, be kind-hearted and understanding. She really is not who you take her to be.'  'What do you mean by that?'  'She's not your rival, Yennefer.'  For a moment they measured each other with their eyes, the enchantress and the priestess, and Ciri felt  the air quiver, a strange, terrible force between them growing in strength. This lasted no more than a  fraction of a second after which the force disappeared and Yennefer burst out laughing, lightheartedly and  sweetly. 'I forgot,' she said.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Like the  mother he never had.'  'And you're always against him,' smiled the priestess. 'Bestowing him with strong feelings, as usual. And  defending yourself as hard as you can not to call the feelings by their rightful name.'  Once again, Ciri felt fury rise up somewhere in the pit of her stomach, and her temples throbbed with  spite and rebellion. She remembered how many times and under what circumstances she had heard that  name. Yennefer.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"She listened to Yennefer's speech with her back ostentatiously turned, pretending to bestow her full  attention on the bumble bee buzzing in the flower of one of the hollyhocks growing by the temple wall. 'No one asked me about it,' she mumbled. 'What didn't anybody ask you about?'  Ciri turned in a half-pirouette and furiously whacked the hollyhock with her fist. The bumble bee flew  away, buzzing angrily and ominously. 'No one asked me whether I wanted you to teach me!'  Yennefer rested her fists on her hips; her eyes flashed.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"To  examine what is inside you and how that could endanger you. And I, though not unreluctantly, agreed.'  'But I haven't agreed yet!'  The magician raised her arm and moved her hand. Ciri experienced a throbbing in her temples and a  buzzing in her ears, as if she were swallowing but much louder. She felt drowsy, and an overpowering  weakness, tiredness stiffened her neck and softened her knees. Yennefer lowered her hand and the sensation instantly passed.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I've only come here for a short  period! I'm going back to Kaer Morhen soon ...'  'You are persistently staring at my neckline,' said Yennefer icily, narrowing her violet eyes a little. 'Do you  see anything unusual there or is it just plain jealousy?'  'That star ...' muttered Ciri. 'What's it made of? Those stones move and shine so strangely ...'  'They pulsate,' smiled the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Do you want to see  them close up? Touch them?'  'Yes ... No!' Ciri backed away and angrily tossed her head,  trying to dispel the faint scent of lilac and gooseberries emanating from Yennefer. 'I don't. Why should I?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"For longer! For a whole day ... And night!'  Yennefer looked her in the eyes and Ciri shrivelled under the gaze. 'The saying goes,' said the magician slowly, 'that the night brings solutions. But in your case, Surprise, the  only thing night can bring is yet another nightmare.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"If, on the  other hand, you get tired of it, it will suffice for you to disobey. Then the lessons will instantly cease. Is  that clear?'  Ciri nodded and cast a fleeting glance of her green eyes at the magician. 'Secondly,' continued Yennefer, unpacking her saddle-bags, '1 will demand absolute sincerity. You will  not be allowed to hide anything from me.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"And I will answer. Sincerely.'  'Any question?'  'Any question.'  'As of now?'  'Yes. As of now.'  'What is there between you and Geralt, Lady Yennefer?'  Ciri almost fainted, horrified at her own impertinence, chilled by the silence which followed the question. The enchantress slowly approached her, placed her hands on her shoulders, looked her in the eyes from  up close - and deeply. 'Longing,' she answered gravely.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"We will see if you're cut out for this. Although after your question I would be very surprised if it turned out you aren't. Let's go, my ugly one.'  Ciri bridled. 'Why do you call me that?'  Yennefer smiled with the corners of her lips. 'I promised to be sincere.'  Ciri, annoyed, pulled herself up straight and wriggled in her hard chair which, after many hours of sitting,  hurt her backside.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"a virgin, that means-'  'I know what it means, believe it or not,' interrupted the magician. 'No doubt you'll see this as another  spiteful piece of mockery but I hate to tell you that you are talking a lot of rubbish. Let us get back to the  test.'  'I'm a virgin!' repeated Ciri aggressively. 'Why the tests? Virgins can't do magic!'  'I can't see a solution,' Yennefer leaned back in her chair.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Think and answer: how many stars should there be in the last row?'  'Stars are silly!'  'How many?'  'Three!'  Yennefer did not say anything for a long time. She stared at a detail on the carved wardrobe door known  only to her. The mischievous smile on Ciri's lips started slowly to disappear until finally it disappeared  altogether, without a trace. 'No doubt you were curious to learn,' said the magician very slowly, not ceasing to admire the wardrobe,  'what would happen if you gave me a senseless and stupid reply. You thought perhaps that I might not  notice because I am not in the least interested in your answers?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"one star there. I'm very sorry. Please don't be angry with me.'  'Look at me, Ciri.'  The girl raised her eyes, astonished. Because for the first time the magician had called her by her name. 'Ciri,' said Yennefer.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Don't make me repeat myself, please.'  After apples, pine trees, stars, fishes and houses, came the turn of labyrinths through which she had to  quickly find a path, wavy  lines, blots which looked like squashed cockroaches, and mosaics which made her go cross-eyed and  set her head spinning. Then there was a shining ball on a piece of string at which she had to stare for a  long time. Staring at it was as dull as dish-water and Ciri kept falling asleep. Yennefer, surprisingly, did  not care even though a few days earlier she had scolded her grimly for napping over one of the  cockroach blots. Pouring over the tests had made her neck and back ache and day by day they grew more painful.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"They exercised and practised their balance walking along  the top of the wall which encircled the orchard and farm buildings. Unlike the training in Kaer Morhen,  though, the exercises with Yennefer were always accompanied by theory. The magician taught Ciri how  to breathe, guiding the movement of her chest and diaphragm with strong pressure frorn her hand. She  explained the rules of movement, how muscles and bones work, and demonstrated how to rest, release  tension and relax. During one such session of relaxation, stretched out on the grass and gazing at the sky, Ciri asked a    question which was bothering her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The fact that,  following the Conjunction of the Spheres, people have learned to use magic, is the curse and undoing of  the world. The undoing of mankind. And that's how it is, Ciri. Those who believe that magic is Chaos are  not mistaken.'  Spurred on by its mistress's heels, the magician's black stallion neighed lengthily and slowly made his way  into the heather. Ciri hastened her horse, followed in Yennefer's tracks and caught up with her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Towards the  stars. The fact that following the Conjunction of the Spheres we discovered magic will, one day, allow us  to reach the stars. Dismount, Ciri.'  Yennefer approached the monolith, placed her palm on the coarse surface of the stone and carefully  brushed away the dust and dry leaves. 'Those who consider magic to be a science,' she continued, 'are also right. Remember that, Ciri.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Too sloooowwww! The blow blinds her with its flash, shakes her whole body, the pain paralyses her for a moment, dulls,  deadens, and then suddenly explodes with a terrible strength, sinks its cruel, sharp fangs into her cheek,  yanks, penetrates right through, radiates into the neck, the shoulders, chest, lungs ... 'Ciri!'  She felt the coarse, unpleasant, still coolness of stone on her back and head. She did not remember  sitting down. Yennefer was kneeling next to her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"You won't dream about it any more. I will give you the force  to push those nightmares away. That is why I have brought you here, Ciri - to show you that force. Tomorrow, I am going to start giving it to you.'  Long, arduous days followed, days of intensive study and exhausting work. Yennefer was firm, frequently  stern, sometimes masterfully formidable.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer was firm, frequently  stern, sometimes masterfully formidable. But she was never boring. Previously, Ciri could barely keep  her eyes open in the Temple school and would  sometimes even doze off during a lesson, lulled by the monotonous, gentle voice of Nenneke, Iola the  First, Hrosvitha or some other teacher. With Yennefer, it was impossible. And not only because of the  timbre of the lady magician's voice and the short, sharply accentuated sentences she used.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The study of magic. Fascinating, exciting and absorbing  study. Ciri spent most of the day with Yennefer. She returned to the dormitory late at night, collapsed into bed  like a log and fell asleep immediately. The novices complained that she snored very loudly and tried to  wake her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The novices complained that she snored very loudly and tried to  wake her. In vain. Ciri slept deeply. With no dreams. 'Oh, gods.' Yennefer sighed in resignation and, ruffling her black hair with both hands, lowered her head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Oh, gods.' Yennefer sighed in resignation and, ruffling her black hair with both hands, lowered her head. 'But it's so simple! If you can't master this move, what will happen with the harder ones?'  Ciri turned away, mumbled something in a raspy voice and massaged her stiff hand. The magician sighed  once more. 'Take another look at the etching.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"As part of the sincerity you promised ... May I ask you something?'  'You may. But, by all the gods, not about virginity, please.'  Ciri bit her lip and did not say anything for a long time. 'Too bad,' sighed Yennefer. 'Let it be.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Lady Yennefer, how does it really work? How can one know  that the time has come ...'  .'... to go to bed with a man?'  Ciri blushed a deep shade of crimson. She said nothing for a while then raised her eyes and nodded. 'It's easy to tell,' said Yennefer, naturally.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'It's easy to tell,' said Yennefer, naturally. 'If you are beginning to think about it then it's a sign the time has  come.'  'But I don't want to!'  'It's not compulsory. You don't want to, then you don't.'  'Ah.' Ciri bit her lip again. 'And that ... Well ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Nor did she have any problems enunciating the frequently complicated intonations. Yennefer  was clearly pleased and, from day to day, was becoming more pleasant and sympathetic. More and  more frequently, taking breaks in the studies, both gossiped and joked about any old thing; both even  began to amuse themselves by delicately poking fun at Nenneke who often 'visited' their lectures and  exercises - bristling and puffed up like a brooding hen - ready to take Ciri under her protective wing, to  protect and save her from the magician's imagined severity and the 'inhuman tortures' of her education. Obeying instructions, Ciri moved to Yennefer's chamber. Now they were together not only by day but  also by night.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"In the beginning it had seemed that Yennefer was not at all interested in her lot,  in her childhood in Cintra or the later events of war. But in time her questions became more and more  concrete. Ciri had to reply and did so very unwillingly because every question the magician asked opened  a door in her memory which she had promised herself never to open, which she wanted to keep forever  locked. Ever since she had met Geralt in Sodden, she had believed she had begun 'another life', that the  other life - the one in Cintra - had been irrevocably wiped out. The Geralts in Kaer Morhen never  asked her about anything and, before coming to the temple, Geralt had even prevailed upon her not to  say a word to anyone about who she was.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I really don't remember, Lady Yennefer.'  Yennefer did not insist. She asked different questions. She did so gently and tactfully and Ciri grew more  and more at ease. Finally, she started to speak herself. Without waiting to be asked, she recounted her  years as a child in Cintra and on the Isles of  Skellige.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Oh!' said Yennefer on listening to the story, 'I'd give a lot to see that - Geralt, I mean. I'm trying to  imagine the expression on his face in Brokilon, when he saw what sort of Surprise destiny had concocted  for him! Because he must have had a wonderful expression when he found out who you were?'  Ciri giggled and her emerald eyes lit up devilishly. 'Oh, yes!' she snorted. 'What an expression!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I'll show you. Look at me!'  Yennefer burst out laughing. That laughter, thought Ciri watching swarms of black birds flying eastwards, that laughter, shared and  sincere, really brought us together, her and me. We understood ~ both she and I - that we can laugh and  talk together about him. About Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I've already told you, under no  circumstances are you allowed to touch the energy of fire!'  'Don't shout. I remember.'  They sat in silence on a fallen dry tree trunk, listening to the wind rustling in the tree tops, listening to a  woodpecker hammering away somewhere close-by. Ciri was hungry and her saliva was thick from thirst,     but she knew that complaining would not get her anywhere. In the past, a month ago, Yennefer had  reacted to such complaints with a dry lecture on how to control such primitive instincts; later, she had  ignored them in contemptuous silence. Protesting was just as useless and produced as few results as  sulking over being called 'ugly one'.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"All of that is in the past, and there's no returning to the past. She once said so herself. 'Tell me about your parents, Ciri.'  'I can't remember them, Lady Yennefer.'  'Please try to.'  'I really don't remember my papa ... she said in a quiet voice, succumbing to the command. 'Except ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"They had been  swallowed up by a tempest which no one had foreseen. A tempest which should not have broken out ... Ciri turned her head away so that Yennefer would not see the tears swelling in her eyes. Why all this, she  thought. Why these questions, these recollections?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Is it right to do that? Mother Nenneke taught us that we mustn't  take anything just like that, for the fun of it. Even the cherry has to be left on its tree for the birds, so that  it can simply fall.'  Yennefer put her arm around Ciri, kissed her gently on the hair at her temple. 'I wish,' she muttered, 'others could hear what you said. Vil-gefortz, Francesca, Terranova ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"I'll just conjure up some ice ...'  There was a great fuss about that small amount of blood. Yennefer and Nenneke did not talk to each  other for a week. For a week, Ciri lazed around, read books and got bored because the magician had put her studies on  hold. The girl did not see her for entire days - Yennefer disappeared somewhere at dawn, returned in the  evening, looked at her strangely and was oddly taciturn. After a week, Ciri had had enough.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Control yourself,  concentrate and begin.'  'No, please, Lady Yennefer ... It hurts ... I feel sick ...'  'Just no tears, Ciri. There's no sight more nauseating than a magician crying. Nothing arouses greater pity.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Hurt with the strange sort of  pain oddly associated with bliss. To relax, they once again ran around the park. Yennefer persuaded Nenneke to take Ciri's sword out of  storage and so enabled the girl to practise her steps, dodges and attacks - in secret, of course, to prevent  the other priestesses and novices seeing her. But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Although not Lambert and Coen. Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen. Ciri guessed why - when they spoke of the Keep - the eyes of the  enchantress grew warm, lost their angry gleam and their cold, indifferent, wise depth. If the words had  befitted Yennefer's person, Ciri would have called her dreamy, lost in memories. Ciri could guess the reason.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer, as if casually, as if indifferently, asking as if banal,  sparing questions, dragged the rest from her. Her eyes were hard and impenetrable. Ciri could guess the reason. And, amazingly, she no longer felt annoyed. Magic was calming.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Sometimes she studied books, sometimes read letters which she received by means of strange couriers,  usually birds. At times she simply sat gazing into the distance. With one hand, and lost in thought, she  ruffled her black, shiny locks, with the other she stroked Ciri's head as she sat on the grass, snuggled up  to the magician's warm, firm thigh. 'Lady Yennefer?'  'I'm here, ugly one.'  'Tell me, can one do anything with magic?'  'No.'  'But you can do a great deal, am I right?'     'You are.' The enchantress closed her eyes for a moment and touched her eyelids with her fingers. 'A  great deal.'  'Something really great ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"You don't know how lucky you  are.'  'But I want to be really pretty!'  'You are really pretty. A really pretty ugly one. My pretty little ugly one ...'  'Oh, Lady Yennefer!'  'Ciri, you're going to bruise my thigh.'  'Lady Yennefer?'  'Yes.'  'What are you looking at like that?'  'At that tree. That linden tree.'  'And what's so interesting about it?'  'Nothing. I'm simply feasting my eyes on it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer did not look at her as she stood at the window with her back turned, staring at the hills looming  black in the east. Above the hills, the sky was dark with flocks of ravens and crows. In a minute she's going to ask why I didn't like her, thought Ciri. No, she's too clever to ask such a  question. She'll dryly draw my attention to my grammar and ask when I started using the past tense.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Only Nenneke saw them off. She spoke quietly and at length with Yennefer, then they both - the  magician and the priestess -shook each other's hand, hard, like men. Ciri, holding the reins of her  dapple-grey mare, wanted to say goodbye in the same way, but Nenneke did not allow it. She embraced  her, hugged her and gave her a kiss. There were tears in her eyes.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"The  Time of Contempt and the Wolf's Blizzard. Take care of her, Yennefer. Don't let anyone harm her.'  'I'll be back, Mother,' said Ciri, leaping into her saddle. Til be back for sure! Soon!'  She did not know how very wrong she was.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Yennefer
"Philippa was watching him, her eyes narrowed,  but nothing indicated that she was using spells to verify his truthfulness. 'Then I'll wait until he's back,' sighed Dijkstra, pretending to believe him. 'The matter I want to see him  about is important so I'll make some changes to my schedule and wait for the Geralt. When he's back,  bring him here. The sooner the better.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Maybe I can answer them?'  'Don't make me laugh, Dandelion.'  'Yet,' Philippa Eilhart said suddenly, 'perhaps he can? Maybe he can save us time? Don't forget, Dijkstra,  our poet is mixed up to his ears in this affair and we've got him here but we haven't got the Geralt. Where is the child seen with Geralt in Kaedwen? The girl with ashen hair and green eyes?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her? Where did Yennefer go when she received  Geralt's letter? Where is Triss Merigold hiding, and why is she hiding?'  Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback. The questions Philippa had raised had clearly been asked too soon.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"A big grey owl glided down to the sill without a sound. Shani cried out quietly. Geralt reached for his  sword. 'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion. The owl disappeared and Phillippa Eilhart appeared in its place, squatting awkwardly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"It's a shame we've only got one chair in here.'  'It's quite enough.' The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by  Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani. The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed. 'In principle, what I've come about is the sole concern of Geralt of Rivia,' Philippa began after a short  pause. 'I'm aware, however, that to ask anybody to leave would be tactless, and so ...'  'I can leave,' said Shani hesitantly. 'You can't,' muttered Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"You're studying medicine, are you, Shani? What year?'  'Third,' grunted the girl. 'Ah,' Philippa Eilhart was looking not at her but at the Geralt, 'seventeen, what a beautiful age. Yennefer  would give a lot to be that age again. What do you reckon, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Sometimes - as in this particular instance - I am  not allowed to tell the king outright that he is committing a mistake, or to dissuade him from a hasty  action. I simply have to render it impossible for him to make a mistake. You understand what I'm saying?'  The Geralt confirmed with a nod. Dandelion wondered whether he really did understand, because he  knew that Philippa was lying through her teeth. 'So I see,' said Geralt slowly, proving that he understood perfectly well, 'that the Council of Wizards is  also interested in my ward.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"And guard that child, damn it! Guard that girl as though she's the apple of  your eye! And if you can't do so yourself, ask others to!'  For a moment Dandelion thought the Geralt was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer. He    would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Philippa knew everything. Philippa was warning him. And the Geralt understood her  warning. He concentrated on observing their eyes and faces, wondering whether by any chance something in the  past had tied the two together. Dandelion knew that similar duels of words and allusions -demonstrating a  mutual fascination - waged between the Geralt and enchantresses very often ended in bed.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"And I know where he is.'  In the silence which fell the first drops of rain knocked on the gutter outside the window. would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments. But Geralt said nothing. The poet  guessed why. Philippa knew everything.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa

"A second later, the oval went out, for a moment plunging the little street into impenetrable,  dense, velvety blackness. Somewhere in the lanes fighting cats yowled. Geralt looked at the blade of the sword he had picked up  on his way towards the magician. 'Why, Philippa? Why did you do it?'  The magician took a step back.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Please! I don't want to hurt you but if you come near-'  'Philippa!' shouted Dandelion, still holding the weeping Shani. 'Have you gone mad?'  'No,' said the Geralt with some effort. 'She's quite sane. And knows perfectly well what she's doing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Calm down and let Shani and me take  care of you.'  'She's right!' shouted Dandelion, 'you're wounded, damn it! Your wound has to be dressed and we've got  to get out of here! You can argue later!'  'You and your great cause ...' The Geralt, ignoring the troubadour, staggered forward. 'Your great  cause, Philippa, and your choice, is a wounded man, stabbed in cold blood once he told you what you  wanted to know, but what I wasn't to find out. Your great cause is Rience, whom you allowed to escape  so that he wouldn't by any chance reveal the name of his patron.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa
"Because Yennefer has already  chosen. Your destiny is in her hands, Geralt. You placed it in those hands yourself.'  The Geralt staggered. Shani yelled and tore herself away from Dandelion. Geralt held her back with a  gesture, stood upright and looked straight into the dark eyes of Philippa Eilhart.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Philippa

"We've been waiting for you.'  'Greetings, Vesemir. Greetings, lads. It's good to be home again.'  'Who have you brought us?'  Geralt was silent for a moment, then put his hand on Ciri's shoulder and lightly pushed her forward. She  walked awkwardly, hesitantly, huddled up and hunched, her head lowered. I'm frightened, she thought.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"What's more, she saw nothing of what she had  expected in those eyes. 'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek. And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen Geralts, Lambert, was  there with his usual ugly, mocking expression. Vesemir was not there.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"So much ...'  'Triss.' He moved her away delicately. 'We're not alone ... They're coming.'  She glanced at the entrance and saw the shadows of the approaching Geralts only after some time,    heard their steps even later. Oh well, her hearing, which she considered very sensitive, could not compete  with that of a Geralt. 'Triss, my child!'  'Vesemir!'  Vesemir was really very old.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Oh, Triss, old age is no joke. My bones ache so I want to howl. Will you help an old  man, child?'  'I will.' The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the Geralt  accompanying Vesemir. He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black  beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox. This was unusual; Geralts  were generally highly immune to infectious diseases.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"'Triss Merigold, Coen.' Geralt introduced them to each other. 'This is Coen's first winter with us. He  comes from the north, from Poviss.'  The young Geralt bowed. He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"But it seems you have muddled the stories, boys. In the fairy-tales I was  told, shepherdesses and orphans become princesses. But here, I see, a princess is becoming a Geralt. Does that not appear somewhat daring to you?'  Vesemir glanced at Geralt. The white-haired Geralt remained silent, his face perfectly still; he did not  react with even the slightest quiver of his eyelids to Vesemir's unspoken request for support.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"The white-haired Geralt remained silent, his face perfectly still; he did not  react with even the slightest quiver of his eyelids to Vesemir's unspoken request for support. 'It's not what you think.' The old man cleared his throat. 'Geralt brought her here last autumn. She has no  one apart from- Triss, how can one not believe in destiny when-'  'What has destiny to do with waving a sword around?'  'We are teaching her to fence,' Geralt said quietly, turning  towards her and looking her straight in the eyes. 'What else are we to teach her?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"It is.' Vesemir took a deep breath. 'Triss, you must be tired. And hungry?'  'I cannot deny it,' she sighed, giving up on trying to catch Geralt's eye. 'To be honest, I'm on my last legs. I spent last night  on the Trail in a shepherd's hut which was practically falling apart, buried in straw and sawdust.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
For what purpose? Vesemir's illness was just a pretext. Vesemir was a Geralt. The fact that he was also an old man did not  change the fact that many a youngster could envy him his health. If the old man had been stung by a  manticore or bitten by a werewolf Triss would have accepted that she had been summoned to aid him.,Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"If the old man had been stung by a  manticore or bitten by a werewolf Triss would have accepted that she had been summoned to aid him. But 'aching bones' was a joke. For an ache in his bones, not a very original complaint within the  horrendously cold walls of Kaer Morhen, Vesemir could have treated with a Geralts' elixir or - an  even simpler solution - with strong rye vodka, applied internally and externally in equal proportions. He  didn't need a magician, with her spells, filters and amulets. So who had summoned her?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"It's obvious. They want to mutate the child, subject her to the Trial of Grasses and Changes, but they don't know how  to do it. Vesemir was the only Geralt left from the previous generation, and he was only a fencing  instructor. The  Laboratorium, hidden in the vaults of Kaer Morhen, with its dusty demi-Johns of elixirs, the alembics,  ovens and retorts ... None of the Geralts knew how to use them.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"They changed the subject at once. She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"But best of all, stop talking altogether. I'm not  speaking to you. Vesemir, Geralt, have any of you seen how terribly battered this child is? She hasn't got  a single healthy spot on her body!'  'Dear child,' said Vesemir gravely, 'don't let yourself get carried away by your emotions. You were  brought up differently, you've seen children being brought up in another way.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Only that the  girl, not being like you, has her days! And bears them exceptionally badly! And you want her to tear her  lungs out on the Killer and some bloody windmills!'  Despite her outrage, Triss felt an exquisite satisfaction at the sight of the sheepish expressions of the  young Geralts, and Vesemir's jaw suddenly dropping open. 'You didn't even know.' She nodded in what was now a calm, concerned and gentle reproach. 'You're  pathetic guardians.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"You've achieved what you wanted. And maybe  even more.'  'The devil take it,' cursed Coen. 'We've turned out to be right idiots, there's no two ways about it, eh,  Vesemir, and you' Silence,' growled the old Geralt. 'Not a word.'  It was Eskel's behaviour which was most unlikely; he got up, approached the enchantress, bent down  low, took her hand and kissed it respectfully. She swiftly withdrew her hand.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Help  us, Triss.'  The enchantress looked him in the eye and pursed her lips. 'With what? What am I to help you with,  Eskel?'  Eskel rubbed his cheek again, looked at Geralt. The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ... that is, Miss Merigold, to ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Uncle Vesemir! Say yes!'  'I agree ...' Vesemir wheezed out. 'Of course, I agree ...'  'We are very happy.' Only now did Geralt take his hand from his forehead. 'We are extremely pleased,  Triss.'  The enchantress nodded slightly towards him and innocently fluttered her eyelashes, winding a chestnut  lock around her finger. Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"So let us call it advice. I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"The one and only reason?'  'Yes,' Vesemir confirmed after a moment's silence. Triss breathed an imperceptible sigh of relief. For a moment, she was afraid that Geralt would be the one  to confirm it. The first snow fell the following day, fine snowflakes initially, but soon turning into a blizzard. It fell  throughout the night and, in the early morning, the walls of Kaer Morhen were drowned beneath a  snowdrift.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir

"'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"And fallen into a trance.'  We had such a fright,' Vesemir admitted, and sighed. 'Oh, that we did, child. More than we could take.'  'She started speaking with another voice,' the magician stated calmly, looking at the Geralts' eyes  gleaming in the candlelight. 'She started talking about events and matters of which she could  have no knowledge. She started ...",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Foresaw the future. And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"'For whom?' she asked briefly, still gazing at Coen. 'Him,' said Vesemir. 'And me,' Geralt added. And smiled. 'When she woke up-'  'She remembered nothing.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Made of steel  which fell from heaven! Really! Geralt said so and he never lies, you know that!'  'Oh, yes. I know that.'  'I've got to get used to this sword. Uncle Vesemir had it adjusted just right for my weight, height and  arm-length.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"In this sphere these monsters are foreign and there is no place for  them. Do you understand, Ciri?'  'I do, Uncle Vesemir. Geralt explained it to me. I know all that. An ecological niche is-'  'All right, that's fine.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Whatever was happening in the world, the Geralts did not want to know. In the evenings, consistently and determinedly, Triss guided the long conversations held in the dark hall, lit  only by the bursts of flames in the great hearth, towards politics. The Geralts' reactions were always the  same. Geralt, a hand on his forehead, did not say a word. Vesemir nodded, from time to time throwing in  comments which amounted to little more than that 'in his day' everything had been better, more logical,  more honest and healthier.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"But from what Triss has been telling us all     these evenings, it seems the conflict with Nilfgaard is more serious than that, not just some local little war. Is that right, Triss?'  'Even if it were the case,' said the magician spitefully, 'surely that suits you? A serious, bloody war will  lead to more deserted villages, more widowed women, simply hordes of orphaned children-'  'I can't understand your sarcasm.' Geralt took his hand away from his forehead. 'I really can't, Triss.'  'Nor I, my child.' Vesemir raised his head. 'What do you mean?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"The fact that someone can  experience normal love, normal hatred, normal fear, pain and regret, normal joy and normal sadness. That it is coolness, distance and indifference which are considered abnormal. Oh yes, Geralt, it annoys  you, it annoys you so much that you are starting to think about Kaer Morhen's vaults, about the  Laboratorium, the dusty demijohns full of mutagenic poisons-'  'Triss!' called Vesemir, gazing at Geralt's face, suddenly grown pale. But the enchantress refused to be  interrupted and spoke faster and faster, louder and louder. 'Who do you want to deceive, Geralt?",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand. Then  she added a few words she had heard Yarpen Zigrin use, the meanings of which were a total mystery to  her. With a kick, she dispersed the chickens swarming towards the scattered grain, picked up the basket,  turned it upside down, then twirled in a Geralt's pirouette and threw the basket like a discus over the  reed roof of the henhouse. She turned on her heel and set off through the Temple park at a run. She ran lightly, skilfully controlling her breath.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods. The lady magician knew a surprising amount about a Geralt's sword and 'dance'. She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep. She knew Vesemir and  Eskel.",Blood of Elves,Geralt,Vesemir
"'We can't afford to make a blunder or mistake now.'  Those assembled said nothing. Demawend, ruler of Aedirn, sprawled in his armchair staring at the  tankard of beer resting on his belly. Foltest, the Lord of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam and Sodden, and  recently Senior Protector of Brugge, presented his noble profile to everyone by turning his head towards  the window. At the opposite side of the table sat Henselt, King of Kaedwen, running his small, piercing  eyes - glistening from a face as bearded as a brigand's - over the other participants of the council. Meve,  Queen of Lyria, toyed pensively with the enormous rubies in her necklace, occasionally twisting her  beautiful full lips into an ambiguous grimace.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"They have time, we don't!'  'The Scoia'tael,' admitted Henselt, 'have become a real thorn in the backside. They're paralysing my trade  and transport, terrorising the farmers ... we have to put an end to this!'  'If the non-humans want war, they will get it,' threw in Foltest of Temeria. 'I have always been an  advocate of mutual agreement and co-existence but if they prefer a test of strength then we will see who  is the stronger. I am ready.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"If we were to strike at the left bank, Crach would back us up with  all the strength of Skellige. By the gods, this has a chance at success! I back Foltest! Let us not wait, let  us strike first, let us liberate Cintra and chase those sons-of-bitches beyond the Amell pass!'  'Slow down,' snarled Henselt. 'Don't be in such a hurry to tug the lion's whiskers, because this lion is not  dead yet.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"Not telling them that Cintra can only be reborn as a vassal country under your protectorship? You are proposing, to all of us, an attack on Cintra for your own gain? You have suborned Sodden and  Brugge for yourself, are sharpening your teeth on Verden and now you have caught a whiff of Cintra, is  that right?'  'Admit it, Foltest,' snapped Henselt. 'Is Meve right? Is that why you are inciting us to this affair?'  'Come on, leave it.' The ruler of Temeria furrowed his noble brow and bristled angrily.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"But for  the throne of Cintra, cousin, many a king would be prepared to sacrifice his personal happiness-'  'Hold on.' Henselt scratched his beard with a rasp. 'Many a king, you say. Then leave Foltest in peace  for a moment. There are others. In her time, Calanthe wanted to give her granddaughter's hand to Ervyll  of Verden's son.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"The gale howled among the towers of Hagge castle. The kings grew silent. 'Vizimir, Foltest, Demawend, Henselt and Meve,' repeated the marshal. 'They met in a secret council in  Hagge Castle on the Pontar. They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round. 'After all, it was at Hagge, not forty years ago, that Virfuril  defeated Medell's armies, strengthened his control over the Pontar Valley and established today's  borders between Aedirn and Temeria. And today Demawend, Virfuril's son, invites Foltest, Medell's  son, to Hagge, summoning Vizimir of Tretogor, Henselt of Ard Carraigh and the merry widow Meve of  Lyria to complete the set. They are meeting now and holding council in secrecy. Can you guess what they  are discussing, Coehoorn?'  'I can,' the marshal replied succinctly.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Henselt
"'Bloody hell, if you'd ridden over  that the axle would be done for, and the wheels shattered to hell. Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins. 'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf. 'As you can see,  it's better to have a Geralt-girl on your wagon than to travel alone. I warned you just in time.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil. We'll infuse some more saffron and poppy seeds for the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"Cloaks and beaver hats can be pretty  quick to change owners.'  The riders approached swiftly. There were about ten of them. Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note. Two felled birches -no problem. A heap of branches nothing  the wagons couldn't pass.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"Wenck was hunched over; Ciri  saw the white feathers of an arrow sticking out of his side. Despite the wound, he was skilfully hacking  his way past two elves on foot, attacking him from both sides. As Ciri watched another arrow struck him  in the back. The commissar collapsed forward onto his horse's neck but remained in the saddle. Paulie  Dahlberg rushed to his aid.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"Amongst the whirl seething around her, amongst moves so swift that they blurred in front of her eyes, her  sword seemed strangely, unnaturally slow; it seemed ages would pass before it could be fully drawn. The  ground trembled and shook. Ciri suddenly realised that it was not the ground. It was her knees. Paulie Dahlberg, keeping the elf charging at him at bay with his axe, dragged the wounded Wenck along  the ground.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie
"The blade of the axe whirred  and fell, slicing into the collar-bone with a hideous crunch. Paulie fell instantly, without a moan; it looked  as if the force of the blow had broken both his knees. Ciri screamed. Yarpen Zigrin leaped from the wagon. The black-bearded dwarf spun and cut.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Paulie

Vissegerd knows this very well and won't move until he has the assurance that your armies,  Foltest, reinforced by Redanian corps, will disembark on the left bank at his heels.

'Is Meve right? Is that why you are inciting us to this affair?'  'Come on, leave it.' The ruler of Temeria furrowed his noble brow and bristled angrily.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Meve
"'Free, independent and strong. A country which will be an  iron gateway, a bulwark to the north, and not a strip of burned ground over which the Nilfgaardian  cavalry will be able to gather speed!'  'Is it possible to rebuild such a Cintra? Without Calanthe?'  'Don't get all worked up, Foltest,' pouted Meve. 'I've already told you, the Cintrians will never accept a  protectorate or foreign blood on their throne. If you try to force yourself on them as their lord the tables  will be turned.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Meve
"The gale howled among the towers of Hagge castle. The kings grew silent. 'Vizimir, Foltest, Demawend, Henselt and Meve,' repeated the marshal. 'They met in a secret council in  Hagge Castle on the Pontar. They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Meve
"They conferred in privacy.'  'How symbolic,' said the slender, black-haired man wearing an elk tunic marked with the imprints of  armour and rust stains, without looking round. 'After all, it was at Hagge, not forty years ago, that Virfuril  defeated Medell's armies, strengthened his control over the Pontar Valley and established today's  borders between Aedirn and Temeria. And today Demawend, Virfuril's son, invites Foltest, Medell's  son, to Hagge, summoning Vizimir of Tretogor, Henselt of Ard Carraigh and the merry widow Meve of  Lyria to complete the set. They are meeting now and holding council in secrecy. Can you guess what they  are discussing, Coehoorn?'  'I can,' the marshal replied succinctly.",Blood of Elves,Foltest,Meve
"Not of blood. 'Geralt-'  'It was just a dream. A bad dream.'  Ciri shuddered violently, curling her arms and legs up tight. A dream. Just a dream.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The campfire had already died down; the birch logs were red and luminous, occasionally crackling, giving  off tiny spurts of blue flame which illuminated the white hair and sharp profile of the man wrapping a  blanket and sheepskin around her. 'Geralt, I-'  'I'm right here. Sleep, Ciri. You have to rest. We've still a long way ahead of us.'  I can hear music, she thought suddenly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Hold on...! Hold ... 'Geralt?'  'What, Ciri?'  'What did he do to me? What happened? What did he ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'At least tell us about it, even if you have no wish to sing of it. Your songs mention no names, but we know the Geralt you sing of is no other than the famous Geralt of  Rivia, and the enchantress for whom he burns with love is the equally famous Yennefer. And the Child  Surprise, destined for the Geralt and sworn to him from birth, is Ciri, the unfortunate Princess of  Cintra, the town destroyed by the Invaders. Am I right?'  Dandelion smiled, remaining enigmatic and aloof. 'I sing of universal matters, my dear, generous lady,' he  stated.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'You have understood nothing of Master Dandelion's ballad, you have learned nothing! You did not see that these ballads speak of man's fate, that we are no more than toys in the hands of the  gods, our lands no more than their playground. The ballads about destiny portrayed the destinies of us all,  and the legend of Geralt the Geralt and Princess Ciri - although it is set against the true background  of that war - is, after all, a mere metaphor, the creation of a poet's imagination designed to help us-'  'You're talking rubbish, holy man!' hollered Vera Loewenhaupt from the heights of her cart. 'What  legend? What imaginative creation?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And I've  met the enchantress, Lady Yennefer, on several occasions -I used to visit Aedirn and her home town of  Vengerberg. I don't know anything about their being in love, though.'  'But it has to be true,' the attractive elf in the ermine toque   You did not see that these ballads speak of man's fate, that we are no more than toys in the hands of the  gods, our lands no more than their playground.

'What  legend? What imaginative creation?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"But the Geralt  could neither find her nor collect her. And here our poet has missed the truth.'  'Oh yes, he's missed the truth indeed,' butted in a sinewy young man who, judging by his clothes, was a  journeyman on his travels prior to crafting his masterpiece and passing his master's exams. 'The Geralt's  destiny bypassed him: Ciri was killed during the siege of Cintra. Before throwing herself from the  tower, Queen Calanthe killed the princess's daughter with her own hand, to prevent her from falling into  the Nilfgaardians' claws alive.'  'It wasn't like that. Not like that at all!' objected the red-haired man.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"You have often been seen in his company. So talk, Dandelion, if you treasure your  joints. Everything you know.'  'This Ciri,' panted the poet, 'was destined for the Geralt. She's a so-called Child Surprise ... You must  have heard it, the story's well known.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"But never uninvited.'  The wind howled savagely, rippling through the grasses growing over the ruins, rustling in the hawthorn  bushes and tall nettles. Clouds sped across the sphere of the moon, momentarily illuminating the great  castle, drenching the moat and few remaining walls in a pale glow undulating with shadows, and revealing  mounds of skulls baring their broken teeth and staring into nothingness through the black holes of their  eye-sockets. Ciri squealed sharply and hid her face in the Geralt's cloak. The mare, prodded on by the Geralt's heels, carefully stepped over a pile of bricks and passed through  the broken arcade. Her horseshoes, ringing against the flagstones, awoke weird echoes between the  walls, muffled by the howling gale.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Growing  taller and wider it became a door beyond which was a faint glow, the flickering brightness of torches  stuck in iron mounts on the walls. A black figure stood framed in the door, blurred by the brightness. 'Who comes?' Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark. 'Geralt?'    'Yes, Eskel. It's me.'  'Come in.'  The Geralt dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into  her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind  completely.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She saw that he was human after all, that he had an  entirely human face, deformed by a long, ugly, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth  across the length of his cheek up to the ear. 'Since you're here, welcome to Kaer Morhen,' he said. 'What do they call you?'  'Ciri,' Geralt replied for her, silently emerging from the darkness. Eskel turned around. Suddenly, quickly,  wordlessly, the Geralts fell into each other's arms and wound their shoulders around each other tight and  hard.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"There were three. Three humans. Three Geralts,  Ciri corrected herself. She saw nothing but their silhouettes against the fire in the hearth. 'Greetings, Wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"We've been waiting for you.'  'Greetings, Vesemir. Greetings, lads. It's good to be home again.'  'Who have you brought us?'  Geralt was silent for a moment, then put his hand on Ciri's shoulder and lightly pushed her forward. She  walked awkwardly, hesitantly, huddled up and hunched, her head lowered. I'm frightened, she thought.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Come on, Ciri. My horse is waiting at the bottom. We'll go to Kaer  Morhen together.'  'I ought to run.' Ciri shook her head. 'It's not good to stop running because you get milk in your muscles. Geralt says-'  'Geralt is at the keep?'  Ciri frowned, pinched her lips together and shot a glance at the enchantress from beneath her ashen  fringe.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Only those who weren't in the keep at the  time survived.'  'Who attacked them? And why?'  'I don't know,' she lied. 'It was a terribly long time ago, Ciri. Ask the Geralts about it.'  'I have,' grunted the girl. 'But they didn't want to tell me.'  / can understand that, thought the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Freak. Damned by the gods, a creature contrary to nature. No, I do not blame the Geralts for not telling you about it, little Ciri. And I shan't tell you either. I have     even more reason to be silent.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The Geralts appeared unexpectedly and silently, as usual, and, also as usual, from nowhere. They stood  before her, tall, slim, their arms crossed, the weight of their bodies on their left legs - a position from  which, she knew, they could attack in a split second. Ciri stood next to them, in an identical position. In  her ludicrous clothes, she looked very funny. 'Welcome to Kaer Morhern, Triss.'  'Greetings, Geralt.'  He had changed.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"You can still train.'  'Hey.' The Enchantress tossed her hair. 'Politeness comes cheap in Geralts' Keep now, I see. Ciri was  the first to greet me, and  brought me to the castle. She ought to keep me company-'  'She is undergoing training here, Merigold.' Lambert grimaced in a parody of a smile. He always called  her that: 'Merigold', without giving her a title or a name.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'She is a student, not a major  domo. Welcoming guests, even such pleasant ones as yourself, is not one of her duties. We're off, Ciri.'  Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions. She did not  say anything, not wanting to embarrass them further. And, above all, she did not want them to see how  very intrigued and fascinated she was by the girl.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"1 guessed correctly. She decided to attack without delay, not allowing the Geralts to try any ruses. 'The famous Child Surprise?' she said indicating Ciri. 'I see you have applied yourselves to fulfilling the  demands of fate and destiny? But it seems you have muddled the stories, boys.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The Geralt shrugged. Triss, knowing him a little, immediately changed tactics and gave up the argument. She looked at Ciri again. The girl, agilely stepping along the balance beam, executed a half-turn, cut  lightly, and immediately leaped away. The dummy, struck, swayed on its rope.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And  Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting. Aren't you afraid of an unfortunate  accident? Or maybe you're relying on destiny to protect the child against it?'  'Ciri practised for nearly six months without a sword,' said Coen. 'She knows how to move. And we are  keeping an eye on her because-'  'Because this is her home,' finished Geralt quietly but firmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well. They had drunk cider, but the girl had been given water and was clearly both astonished and  revolted by it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Triss giggled. Ha, she thought, Geralts, I've got you! Ciri scared you just as she did me. She 'withdrew'  into a daydream, started to prophesy, gave out an aura which, after all, you can sense almost as well as I  can. She automatically reached for something psy-chokinetically, or bent a pewter spoon with her will as  she stared at it during lunch.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She accepted the tribute of gazes which rewarded her efforts she  had changed her travel clothes for an attractive but simple dress and had skilfully applied magical  scents and non-magical but incredibly expensive cosmetics. She ate her porridge chatting with the  Geralts about unimportant and trivial matters. 'Water again?' muttered Ciri suddenly, peering into her tumbler. 'My teeth go numb when I drink water! I  want some juice!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Finish your food; it's time for training. The days are getting shorter.'  'Geralt.' Triss finished her porridge. 'Ciri fell on the Trail yesterday. Nothing serious, but it was because  of that jester's outfit she wears. It all fits so badly, and it hinders her movements.'  Vesemir cleared his throat and turned his eyes away.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"You're right,  Lambert. But a woman has arrived, and the old order's collapsed; a time of great change has arrived. Come on, Ciri.'  The girl hesitated, looked at Geralt. Geralt nodded his agreement and smiled. Pleasantly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Triss turned her eyes away. His smile was not for her. Ciri's little room was a faithful replica of the Geralts' quarters. It was, like theirs, devoid of almost all  fittings and furniture. There was practically nothing there beside a few planks nailed together to form a  bed, a stool and a trunk.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"There was practically nothing there beside a few planks nailed together to form a  bed, a stool and a trunk. Geralts decorated the walls and doors of their quarters with the skins of  animals they killed when hunting - stags, lynx, wolves and even wolverines. On the door of Ciri's little  room, however, hung the skin of an enormous rat with a hideous scaly tail. Triss fought back her desire to  tear the stinking abomination down and throw it out of the window. The girl, standing by the bed, stared at her expectantly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I've always had a knack for  cutting and sewing so I ought to be able to manage this goatskin, too. And you, little Geralt-girl, have  you ever had a needle in your hand? Have you been taught anything other than making holes with a  sword in sacks of straw?'  'When I was in Transriver, in Kagen, I had to spin,' muttered Ciri unwillingly. 'They didn't give me any  sewing because I only  spoilt the linen and wasted thread; they had to undo everything. The spinning was terribly boring - yuk!'  'True,' giggled Triss.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Even though you are being thumped  and beaten in a thousand ways, you're to get up and carry on practising?'  'Of course. A Geralt's not afraid of anything.'  'Is that so? And you, Ciri? You aren't afraid of anything? Answer truthfully.'  The girl turned away and bit her lip.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Can you turn me into a boy?'  'No,' Triss replied in an icy tone. 'I can't.'  'Hmm ...' The little Geralt-girl was clearly troubled. 'But could you at least ...'  'At least what?'  'Could you do something so I don't have to ...' Ciri blushed. 'I'll whisper it in your ear.'  'Go on.' Triss leaned over. 'I'm listening.'  Ciri, growing even redder, brought her head closer to the enchantress's chestnut hair.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"For almost half a year, having been taken in by a peasant family, she worked on the land and with  the livestock. Believe me, Triss, life has tried, seasoned and hardened her no less than good-for-nothings  like us, who were brought to Kaer Morhen from the highways. Ciri is no weaker than unwanted  bastards, like us, who were left with Geralts in taverns like kittens in a wicker basket. And her gender? What difference does that make?'  'You still ask?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly. At that moment, the door creaked open and Ciri entered the hall. Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ... that is, Miss Merigold, to ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'We are extremely pleased,  Triss.'  The enchantress nodded slightly towards him and innocently fluttered her eyelashes, winding a chestnut  lock around her finger. Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone. 'You behaved very properly and politely, Ciri,' he said, 'offering Miss Merigold our ongoing hospitality in  Kaer Morhen. I am proud of you.'  Ciri reddened and smiled broadly. The enchantress gave her the next pre-arranged sign.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Milking is no great art. You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.'  'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-'  'No, you listen. You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't  tried any elixirs or Grasses on her. And that's to be praised. That was sensible, responsible and humane.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"After that I knew who, or rather what, the girl is.'  'And what is she?'  'A Source.'  'That's impossible!'  'It's possible. Certain even. Ciri is a Source and has mediumistic powers. What is more, these powers  are very, very worrying. And you, my dear Geralts, are perfectly well aware of this.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The first snow fell the following day, fine snowflakes initially, but soon turning into a blizzard. It fell  throughout the night and, in the early morning, the walls of Kaer Morhen were drowned beneath a  snowdrift. There could be no question of running the Killer, especially since Ciri was still not feeling very  well. Triss suspected that the Geralts' accelerants might be the cause of the girl's menstrual problems. She could not be sure, however, knowing practically nothing about the drugs, and Ciri was, beyond  doubt, the only girl in the world to whom they had been administered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She did not share her suspicions  with the Geralts. She did not want to worry or annoy them and preferred to apply her own methods. She gave Ciri elixirs to drink, tied a string of active jaspers around her waist, under her dress, and  forbade her to exert herself in any way, especially by chasing around wildly hunting rats with a sword. Ciri was bored. She roamed the castle sleepily and finally, for lack of any other amusement, joined Coen  who was cleaning the stable, grooming the horses and repairing a harness.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt

"CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I am loyal. And believe me, in this matter I can be loyal to both you and to the Chapter.'  'Such double loyalty' - Geralt looked her in the eyes for the first time that evening - 'is devilishly difficult to  manage. Rarely does it succeed, Triss.'  The enchantress turned her gaze on Ciri. The girl was sitting on a bearskin with Coen, tucked away in the  far corner of the hall, and both were busy playing a hand-slapping game. The game was growing  monotonous as both were incredibly quick - neither could manage to slap the other's hand in any way.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The game was growing  monotonous as both were incredibly quick - neither could manage to slap the other's hand in any way. This, however, clearly neither mattered to them nor spoiled their game. 'Geralt,' she said, 'when you found Ciri, on the Yaruga, you took her with you. You brought her to Kaer  Morhen, hid her from the world and do not let even those closest to the child know she is alive. You did  this because something - about which I know nothing - convinced you that destiny exists, holds sway  over us, and guides us in everything we do.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The magician ran her tongue over her gums and palate. She was unable to  recognise any of the ingredients. 'You gave Ciri some of this ... Seagull to drink,' she surmised. And then-'  'It was an accident,' Geralt interrupted quickly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"You see what I'm thinking?'  'Clearly. That was the second time, get to the third.'  Geralt wiped his brow, suddenly beaded with sweat, on his forearm. 'Ciri often wakes up at night,' he  continued. 'Shouting. She has been through a lot.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing. The magician suddenly realised that she had never, up until now, heard any of the Geralts  laugh.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect. Ciri suddenly grew rigid, cried out, and smiled a  broad, happy smile.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Overcome your     pride, crush your rancour and obstinacy. There is no point to it, you'll torture yourself to death. And you  are risking Ciri's health and life in the process. Another trance is liable to be more dangerous to her than  the Trial of Grasses. Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.'  'And you, Triss?'  'What about me?' She swallowed with difficulty.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The thing that wants to possess her might not be  able to reach her in the temple. And then you will ask Yennefer for help.'  'All right, Triss. Thank you.'  'Geralt?'  'Yes.'  'Ciri said something else, didn't she? Something only you heard. Tell me what it was.'  'No,' he protested and his voice quivered.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Geralt.'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Stay with me tonight.'  'Triss ...'  'Only stay.'  'All right.'  Not long after Midinvaerne the snow stopped falling. The frost came. Triss stayed with Ciri day and night. She watched over her. She surrounded her with care, visible and  invisible.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The weather's beautiful!'  'Don't lean out or you'll fall from the window.'  'Let's go sleighing, Triss!'  'Suggest that again in Elder Speech and we'll end the lesson there. Move away from the window, come  back to the table ... Ciri, how many times do I have to ask you? Stop waving that sword about and put  it away.'  'It's my new sword! It's real, a Geralt's sword!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Killing them does not upset the order and interconnections of nature  which prevail in our present sphere. In this sphere these monsters are foreign and there is no place for  them. Do you understand, Ciri?'  'I do, Uncle Vesemir. Geralt explained it to me. I know all that.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I really did it!! I managed it! Praise me, Geralt!'  'Well done, Ciri. Well done, girl.'  In the middle of February, the snow disappeared, whisked away by a warm wind blowing from the  south, from the pass. Whatever was happening in the world, the Geralts did not want to know.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"No Geralt has yet died of old  age, lying in bed dictating his will. Not a single one. Ciri didn't surprise or frighten me. I know I'm going  to die in some cave which stinks of carcases, torn apart by a griffin, lamia or manticore. But I don't want  to die in a war, because they're not my wars.'  'I'm surprised at you,' she replied sharply.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"But I will  never wear a plunging neckline again, Geralt. Never.'  The Geralts said nothing. Neither did Ciri, who had slipped into the hall without a sound and stopped at  the threshold, hunching her shoulders and folding her arms. 'So,' the magician said after a while, 'don't talk to me about motivation. Before we stood on that Hill the  Chapter simply told us:  That is what you have to do.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"You are not learning to kill out of fear and hatred, but  in order to save lives. Your own and those of others.'  The girl bit her lip, shaking from agitation and anger. 'Understood?'  Ciri raised her head abruptly. 'No.'  'Then you'll never understand. Get out.'  'Geralt, I-'  'Get out.'  Ciri spun on her heel and stood still for a moment, undecided, as if waiting - waiting for something that  could not happen.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I've had enough of all this talk about emotions!'  'And why is that?' The magician smiled derisively and coldly. 'Why, Geralt? Ciri is normal. She has  normal feelings, she accepts emotions naturally, takes them for what they really are. You, obviously, don't  understand and are therefore surprised by them.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The fingers of her left hand were lightly  touching the pommel. On seeing them, the girl jumped, spun in a pirouette and landed softly in an identical but reverse mirror  position. 'Ciri,' said the Geralt, 'come down, please.'  It seemed she hadn't heard him. She did not move, not even a muscle. Triss, however, saw the reflection  of the moon, thrown across her face by the blade, glisten silver over a stream of tears.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She tossed her head defiantly and the next second leaped once more. A loose brick slipped beneath her  foot with a grating sound. Ciri staggered, trying to find her balance. And failed. The Geralt jumped.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"In the valleys,  it is already spring. Shall we leave, Geralt? You, Ciri and I?'  'Yes. It is high time.'    Upriver we saw their towns, as delicate as if they were woven from the morning mist out of which  they loomed. It seemed as if they would disappear a moment later, blown away on the wind which  rippled the surface of the water.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"It fell  accurately upon its victim, and its victim was Triss. Initially it seemed nasty but not too serious, resembling an ordinary stomach upset. Geralt and Ciri  discreetly tried to take no notice of the stops the enchantress's ailment necessitated. Triss, as pale as  death, beaded with sweat and painfully contorted, tried to continue riding for several hours longer, but at  about midday, and having spent an abnormally long time in the bushes by the road, she was no longer in  any condition to sit on a saddle. Ciri tried to help her but to no avail - the enchantress, unable to hold on  to the horse's mane, slid down her mount's flank and collapsed to the ground.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I can't concentrate because of this cramp ...'  'Don't cry.'  'Easy for you to say!'  The Geralt got up, pulled his saddle-bags from Roach's back and began rummaging through them. Triss  curled up, her face contracted and her lips twisted in a spasm of pain. 'Ciri ...'  'Yes, Triss?'  'Do you feel all right? No ... unusual sensations?'  The girl shook her head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
Geralt! Wash your hands. Make sure Ciri washes her hands ...'  'Calm down. Drink this.'  What is it?'  'Ordinary soothing herbs. There's next to no magic in them so they shouldn't do you any harm.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The Geralt did not  pursue the question. Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle. Geralt sat behind  her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's  gelding. They did not even manage a mile. The enchantress kept falling from Geralt's hands; she could not  stay in the saddle.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Take a look, if you wish.'  'Ciri, step away.'  'I want to see, too!' The girl leaned out around him, staring at the corpses with her mouth open. 'Step away, please. Take care of Triss.'  Ciri huffed, unwilling, but obeyed. Geralt came closer. 'Elves,' he noted, not hiding his surprise.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Every one of them- Hey there! Who are you?'  Geralt looked around. Ciri stood right behind him casting her huge emerald eyes over everyone. As far as  the ability to move noiselessly was concerned, she had clearly made enormous progress. 'She's with me,' he explained.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The Scoia'tael  have gone in exactly that direction.'    'I'll manage.'  'From what I've heard about you' - the knight's lips twisted ' I have no doubt you would. But bear in mind you are not alone. You have a gravely sick woman on your  shoulders and this brat ...'  Ciri, who was trying to clean her dung-smeared boot on a ladder rung, raised her head. The knight  cleared his throat and looked down. Geralt smiled faintly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Well, all right. I'll rummage through the bags. I used to have some good medicine for the runs,  maybe there's still a little left.'  'Ciri,' muttered the Geralt, passing her a sheepskin unstrapped from the horse, 'go to sleep, you're  barely on your feet. No, not in the wagon. We'll put Triss in the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"They'll think it's contagious and chase us  away, like the soldiers in the fort.'  'Geralt?' the enchantress moaned suddenly. 'Where ... are we?'  'Amongst friends.'  Tm here,' said Ciri, stroking her chestnut hair. Tm at your side. Don't be afraid.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Lie peacefully.' I've got to ... Oooh ...'  The Geralt leaned over without a word, picked up the enchantress together with her cocoon of  caparisons and blankets, and marched to the woods, into the darkness. Ciri sighed. She turned, hearing heavy panting. Behind the wagon appeared the dwarf, hefting a considerable bundle  under his arm.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I asked out of an inappropriate curiosity born of the desire to start new rumours  going around the inns. But be that as it may, you're mighty attracted to this enchantress, Geralt.'  The Geralt smiled sadly. 'And the girl?' Yarpen indicated Ciri with his head as she wriggled under the sheepskin. 'Yours?'  'Mine,' he replied without thinking. 'Mine, Zigrin.'  The dawn was grey, wet, and smelled of night rain and morning mist.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
The rugs cocooning the enchantress sparkled with dew. Geralt had dark circles under his  eyes. Ciri knew he had not closed them for an instant Triss had run a fever through the night and suffered  greatly. 'Did I wake you? Sorry.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I'd like to  'Yes?' The Geralt leaned over but Triss was already asleep. He straightened himself, stretched. 'Geralt,' whispered Ciri, 'are they going to let us travel on the wagon?'  'We'll see.' He bit his lip. 'Sleep while you can. Rest.'  He jumped down off the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"But I will  not enter the king's service as a soldier. Please don't count on my sword. I have no intention of killing  those, as you call them, evil creatures on the order of other creatures whom I do not consider to be any  better.'  Ciri heard Yarpen Zigrin hiss loudly and cough into his rolled-up sleeve. Wenck stared at the Geralt  calmly. 'I see,' he stated dryly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I know you will prove to be useful and helpful in a way you deem fit. It would be an affront to both of us if I were to treat your good stead as payment for aid offered to a  suffering woman. Is she feeling better today?'  The Geralt gave a nod which seemed, to Ciri, to be somewhat deeper and politer than usual. Wenck's  expression did not change. 'That pleases me,' he said after a normal pause.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'That pleases me,' he said after a normal pause. 'In taking Lady Merigold aboard a wagon in my convoy I  take on the responsibility lor her health, comfort and safety. Zigrin, give the command to march out.'  'Wenck.'  'Yes, Geralt?'  'Thank you.'  The commissar bowed his head, a bit more deeply and politely, it seemed to Ciri, than the usual,  perfunctory politeness required. Yarpen Zigrin ran the length of the column, giving orders and instructions loudly, after which he  clambered onto the coachman's box, shouted and whipped the horses with the reins. The wagon jolted  and rattled along the forest trail.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen. They were talking quietly, drinking beer from a  barrel perched between them. Ciri pricked up her ears but soon grew bored - the discussion concerned  politics and was mainly about King Henselt's intentions and plans, and some special service or missions  to do with secretly aiding his neighbour, King Demawend of Aedirn, who was being threatened by war. Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence. Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She demanded that  someone called Kevyn kept his hands to himself, and immediately after that declared that destiny cannot  be avoided. Finally, having stated that everyone, absolutely everyone, is a mutant to a certain degree, she  fell into a peaceful sleep. Ciri also felt sleepy but was brought to her senses by Yarpen's chuckle, as he reminded Geralt of their  past adventures. This one concerned a hunt for a golden dragon who instead of allowing itself to be  hunted down had counted the hunters' bones and then eaten  a cobbler called Goatmuncher. Ciri began to listen with greater interest.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'I came across her at the market in Gors Velen,' he recounted. 'She barely noticed me - she spat like a  she-cat and insulted my deceased mother horribly. I fled for all I was worth, but she shouted after me  that she'd catch up with me one day and make grass grow out of my arse.'  Ciri giggled, imagining Yarpen with the grass. Geralt grunted something about women and their impulsive  natures - which the dwarf considered far too mild a description for maliciousness, obstinacy and  vindictiveness. Geralt did not take up the subject and Ciri fell into dozing once more.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Oh, get off my wagon, get on your horse, and get out of my sight, with your  arrogant neutrality. You get on my nerves.'  Geralt turned away. Ciri held her breath in anticipation. But the Geralt didn't say a word. He stood and  jumped from the wagon, swiftly, softly and nimbly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Bloody hell, if you'd ridden over  that the axle would be done for, and the wheels shattered to hell. Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins. 'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf. 'As you can see,  it's better to have a Geralt-girl on your wagon than to travel alone. I warned you just in time.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon. 'But I didn't  want to ... interrupt this interesting conversation.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"When  you're healthy, too, come to that. You remember old Schrader? His wife once told him to wash, and  Schrader went and died soon afterwards.'  'Because a rabid dog bit him.'  'If he hadn't washed, the dog wouldn't have bitten him.'  'I think,' said Ciri, checking the temperature of the water in the cauldron with her finger, 'it's excessive to  wash every day too. But Triss asked for it - she even started crying once ... So Geralt and I-'  'We know.' The elder Dahlberg nodded.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil. We'll infuse some more saffron and poppy seeds for the magician.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"We'll turn them into a fishing-trap.'  'Why mine?'  'Pull them off, at the double, or I'll wallop you, snothead! Didn't mother say you have to listen to me?'  'Hurry up if you want to go fishing because dusk is just round the corner,' said Yarpen. 'Ciri, is the water  hot yet? Leave it, leave  it, you'll burn yourself and get dirty from the cauldron. I know you're strong but let me - I'll carry it.'  Geralt was already waiting for them; they could see his white hair through the gap in the canvas covering  the wagon from afar.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her. They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own. They coped exceptionally well - he supported the  enchantress in his arms, Ciri washed and dried her. Only one thing had started to surprise and annoy Ciri    -Triss, in her opinion, snuggled up to Geralt too tightly. This time she was even trying to kiss him. Geralt indicated the magician's saddle-bags with his head.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She found the comb and knelt  down beside her. Triss, lowering her head towards her, put her arms around the Geralt. In Ciri's  opinion, definitely a little too tightly. 'Oh, Geralt,' she sobbed. 'I so regret ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her. He did not need to lean over in  order to do so, as Geralt did.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Damn it all, it took a hundred years  but, somehow or other, we managed to live a common life, next to each other, together. We managed to  partially convince humans that we're not so very different-'  'We're not different at all, Yarpen.'  The dwarf turned abruptly. 'We're not different at all,' repeated Ciri. 'After all, you think and feel like Geralt. And like ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"During the pogrom.'  *  'Riders!' shouted one of Wenck's advance guards. 'Riders ahead!'  The commissar trotted up to Yarpen's wagon and Geralt approached from the other side. 'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely. 'Get off the box and get in the back! Stay with Triss.'  'I can't see anything from there!'  'Don't argue!' growled Yarpen.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"No, damn it, we can't travel blindly as we've been doing until now, whistling away, dozing  and sleepily farting. We have to know what lies ahead of us. Listen, I've an idea.'  Ciri pulled her chestnut up sharply, and then launched into a gallop, leaning low in the saddle. Geralt,  engrossed in conversation with Wenck, suddenly sat up straight. 'Don't run wild!' he called.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note. Two felled birches -no problem. A heap of branches nothing  the wagons couldn't pass.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The Squirrels. Scoia'tael. Before Geralt had ordered her to leave, Ciri had managed to take a look at the corpses in the fort. She  remembered one in particular - his face covered by hair stuck together with darkened blood, his neck  unnaturally twisted and bent. Pulled back in a ghastly, set grimace, his upper lip revealed teeth, very white  and very tiny, non-human.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Geralt looked around, alert. He did not allow her to ride independently; he did not give her the chestnut's  reins; he led the horse himself. 'Ciri,' he said suddenly. 'Not a word about what we saw. Not to Yarpen, not to Wenck.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She kicked the chestnut with her heels and  moved away faster, but he motioned for her to stay behind him. They cut across the trail and reentered  the wild forest. The Geralt led, Ciri following in his tracks. Neither said anything. Not for a long time.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Not for a long time. 'Look.' Geralt held back his horse. 'Look, Ciri.'  'What is it?' she sighed. 'Shaerrawedd.'  In front of them, as far as the woods allowed them to see, rose smoothly hewn blocks of granite and  marble with blunt corners, worn away by the winds, decorated with patterns long leached out by the  rains, cracked and shattered by frost, split by tree roots. Amongst the trunks' broken columns flashed  white, arcades, the remains of ornamental friezes entwined with ivy, and wrapped in a thick layer of green  moss.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"In these places, the marble, terracotta and mosaics were still as vibrant with colour, as fresh as if they had  been lying there for three days, not two centuries. Geralt leapt across the stream and went in amongst what remained of the columns. Ciri followed. They  jumped off the ruined stairs and, lowering their heads, walked beneath the untouched arch of the arcade,  half buried beneath a mound of earth. The Geralt stopped and indicated with his hand.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"It was a face which the  chisels of plunderers digging out golden ornaments, mosaics and precious stones from the relief sculpture  had not managed to disfigure. 'Aelirenn,' said Geralt after a long silence. 'She's beautiful,' whispered Ciri, grabbing him by the hand. The Geralt didn't seem to notice. He stared  at the sculpture and was far away, far away in a different world and time.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"They took up arms and followed her into their last desperate  battle. And they were massacred. Mercilessly massacred.'  Ciri did not say anything, staring at the beautiful, still face. 'They died with her name on their lips,' the Geralt continued quietly. 'Repeating her challenge, her cry,  they died for Shaerrawedd.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"We are standing in the ruins of her palace, by the fountain whose waters she listened to in the evenings. And these ... these were her flowers.'  Ciri was silent. Geralt drew her to himself, put his arm around her. 'Do you know now why the Scoia'tael were here, do you see what they wanted to look at?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Quick, Geralt! We've got to help! To the horses, Geralt!'  'Ciri! What's happening?'    'They're dying!'  She galloped with her ear almost touching the horse's neck and spurred her mount on, kicking with her  heels and shouting. The sand of the forest path flew beneath the hooves.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"She heard screaming in the  distance, and smelt smoke. Coming straight at them, blocking the path, raced two horses dragging a harness, reins and a broken  shaft behind them. Ciri did not hold her chestnut back and shot past them at full speed, flakes of froth  skimming across her face. Behind her she heard Roach neigh and Geralt's curses as he was forced to a  halt. She tore around a bend in the path in to a large glade.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"From thickets, flaming arrows flew towards the wagons like fire birds,  perforating the canvas and digging into the boards. The Scoia'tael attacked with war-cries and yells. Ciri, ignoring Geralt's shouts from behind her, directed her horse straight at the first two wagons brought  to the fore. One was lying on its side and Yarpen Zigrin, axe in one hand, crossbow in the other, stood  next to it. At his feet, motionless, with her blue dress hitched halfway up her thighs, lay ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Jump!' yelled Yarpen, shouting over the noise. 'Jump. Yannick!'  Ciri saw Geralt catch up with the speeding wagon and with a short, spare slash of his sword swipe one of  the elves from his saddle while Wenck, riding up on the opposite side, hewed at the other, the elf  shooting the horses. Yannick threw the reins down and jumped off - straight under the third Scoia'tael's  horse. The elf stood in his stirrups and slashed at him with his sword.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Aelirenn!' shouted the Squirrel loudly as if wanting to shatter her hesitation with the cry. But she was too  late. Geralt, shoving Ciri away, slashed her broadly across the chest with his sword. Blood spurted over  the girl's face and clothes, red drops spattered on the white petals of the rose. 'Aelirenn ...' moaned the elf shrilly, collapsing to her knees.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Before she fell on her face, she managed to  shout one more time. Loudly, lengthily, despairingly:  'Shaerraweeeeedd!'  Reality returned just as suddenly as it had disappeared. Through the monotonous, dull hum which filled  her ears, Ciri began to hear voices. Through the flickering, wet curtain of tears, she began to see the living  and the dead. 'Ciri,' whispered Geralt who was kneeling next to her.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Hey, quick now, bring the stretcher! Stretcher!'  'No need,' the magician said hollowly, gazing at Wenck's lips where no more bubbles appeared. Ciri  turned away and pressed her face to Geralt's side. Fredegard drew himself up. Yarpen Zigrin did not look at him.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The dwarf slowly turned his head, looked at him. At Geralt. At Ciri. At them all. The humans.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The eyes of the long-legged elf were glassy and dull. Her contorted lips were frozen in a soundless cry. Geralt put his arms around Ciri. Slowly, he unpinned the white rose, spattered with dark stains, from her  jerkin and, without a word, threw it on the Squirrel's body. 'Farewell,' whispered Ciri.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The barge, as  ungainly as a tortoise, trudged along at an appropriate speed that being  the speed of a tortoise - dictated by the lazy Delta current. The passengers, mostly merchants and  peasants, were dozing on their baggage. The Geralt unfurled the scroll once more and returned to Ciri's  letter. ... I sleep in a large hall called a Dormitorium and my bed is terribly big, I tell you.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Geralt, you promised to come. Come. Your Ciri  PS Come, come. PS II. Mother Nenneke told me to end with Praise be to Great Melitele, may her blessing and favour  always go with you.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Geralt, you promised to come. Come. Your Ciri  PS Come, come. PS II. Mother Nenneke told me to end with Praise be to Great Melitele, may her blessing and favour  always go with you.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
A black burgee dotted with silver  lilies fluttered lazily from its mast. The crew consisted of several men wearing the pointed hats of  Temerian Guards. Geralt quickly reached into his bag and pulled out both letters -the one from Ciri and the one from  Yennefer. He swiftly tore them into tiny shreds and threw them into the river. The customs officer  watched him in silence.,Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"They don't have any time for work because they are, apparently,  studying Geralty. But in actual fact they're probably only idling or skipping around the park thrashing  weeds with a stick. You know who I'm talking about, Ciri, don't you?'  'Ciri will leave for the war no doubt,' giggled Iola the Second. 'After all, she is apparently the daughter of  a knight! And herself a great warrior with a terrible sword!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Sorceresses are not our sort of company.'  'Of course they aren't!' yelled Ciri and threw the basket of grain on the ground. 'Chickens are your sort  of company!'     The novices turned up their noses and left, passing through the hoard of cackling fowl. Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand. Then  she added a few words she had heard Yarpen Zigrin use, the meanings of which were a total mystery to  her. With a kick, she dispersed the chickens swarming towards the scattered grain, picked up the basket,  turned it upside down, then twirled in a Geralt's pirouette and threw the basket like a discus over the  reed roof of the henhouse.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"In Cintra, as she remembered, an  attractive man was one whose head reached the ceiling, whose shoulders were as broad as a doorway,  who swore like a dwarf, roared like a buffalo and stank at thirty paces of horses, sweat and beer,  regardless of what time of day or night it was. Men who did not correspond to this description were not  recognised by Queen Calanthe's chambermaids as worthy of sighs and gossip. Ciri had also seen a  number of different men the wise and gentle druids of Angren, the tall and gloomy settlers of Sodden, the  Geralts of Kaer Morhen. Jarre was different. He was as skinny as a stick-insect, ungainly, wore clothes  which were too large and smelled of ink and dust, always had greasy hair and on his chin, instead of  stubble, there were seven or eight long hairs, about half of which sprang from a large wart.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'I thought ...' She cleared her throat. 'I thought one of them might be from Geralt ...'  'If it was, I'd have given it to you.' The magician turned in her chair and sat facing her. 'Are you going to  be long washing?'  'I've finished.'  'Get up, please.'  Ciri obeyed. Yennefer smiled faintly. 'Yes,' she said, 'you've finished with childhood.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Your abilities will either have to be extinguished or you will have to learn how to control them. If you are  gifted and want to, I can try to instil in you some elementary knowledge of magic.'  'What does  elementary  mean?'  'Basic'  They were alone in the large chamber next to the library in an unoccupied side wing of the building, which  Nenneke had allocated to the lady magician. Ciri knew that this chamber was used by guests. She knew  that Geralt, whenever he visited the Temple, stayed right here. 'Are you going to want to teach me?' She sat on the bed and skimmed her hand over the damask  eiderdown.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And I will answer. Sincerely.'  'Any question?'  'Any question.'  'As of now?'  'Yes. As of now.'  'What is there between you and Geralt, Lady Yennefer?'  Ciri almost fainted, horrified at her own impertinence, chilled by the silence which followed the question. The enchantress slowly approached her, placed her hands on her shoulders, looked her in the eyes from  up close - and deeply. 'Longing,' she answered gravely.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"In the beginning it had seemed that Yennefer was not at all interested in her lot,  in her childhood in Cintra or the later events of war. But in time her questions became more and more  concrete. Ciri had to reply and did so very unwillingly because every question the magician asked opened  a door in her memory which she had promised herself never to open, which she wanted to keep forever  locked. Ever since she had met Geralt in Sodden, she had believed she had begun 'another life', that the  other life - the one in Cintra - had been irrevocably wiped out. The Geralts in Kaer Morhen never  asked her about anything and, before coming to the temple, Geralt had even prevailed upon her not to  say a word to anyone about who she was.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"'Oh!' said Yennefer on listening to the story, 'I'd give a lot to see that - Geralt, I mean. I'm trying to  imagine the expression on his face in Brokilon, when he saw what sort of Surprise destiny had concocted  for him! Because he must have had a wonderful expression when he found out who you were?'  Ciri giggled and her emerald eyes lit up devilishly. 'Oh, yes!' she snorted. 'What an expression!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"I'll show you. Look at me!'  Yennefer burst out laughing. That laughter, thought Ciri watching swarms of black birds flying eastwards, that laughter, shared and  sincere, really brought us together, her and me. We understood ~ both she and I - that we can laugh and  talk together about him. About Geralt.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Yennefer persuaded Nenneke to take Ciri's sword out of  storage and so enabled the girl to practise her steps, dodges and attacks - in secret, of course, to prevent  the other priestesses and novices seeing her. But magic was omnipresent. Ciri learned how - using simple  spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her  aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short  periods. The lady magician knew a surprising amount about a Geralt's sword and 'dance'. She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"The basket jumped! Did you see?'  'It barely twitched. Ciri, sparingly does not mean weakly. Psychokinesis is used with a specific goal in  mind. Even Geralts use the Sign of Aard to throw their opponent off his feet.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"And how ... How old were you when ... No, I won't ask about that-'  'Sixteen.'  'Aha ...' Ciri blushed faintly and pretended to be suddenly interested in a strangely formed cloud  hovering over the temple towers. 'And how old were you ... when you met Geralt?'  'Older, ugly one.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Geralt
"Is it so vital for you to talk to an artist that you press money on  him before you've even introduced yourself and, in doing so, break the most elementary rules of  courtesy?'  'At the beginning of our conversation' - the stranger's dark eyes narrowed imperceptibly - 'my anonymity  did not bother you.'  'And now it is starting to.'     'I am not ashamed of my name,' said the man, a faint smile appearing on his narrow lips. 'I am called  Rience. You do not know me, Master Dandelion, and that is no surprise. You are too famous and well  known to know all of your admirers. Yet everyone who admires your talents feels he knows you, knows  you so well that a certain degree of familiarity is permissible.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"From your ballad, however, it would appear that the child survived. I  am truly interested to know if this is your imagination at work, or the truth? True or false?'    'I'm extremely pleased you're so interested.' Dandelion smiled broadly. 'You may laugh, Master  whatever-your-name-is, but that was precisely what I intended when I composed the ballad. I wished to  excite my listeners and arouse their curiosity.'  'True or false?' repeated Rience coldly.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"He stared at the poet with his  unfriendly, moist eyes, and the poet felt a growing unease. A merry din came from the bawdy-house's  main room, punctuated from time to time by high-pitched feminine giggles. Dandelion turned his head  away, pretending to show derisive haughtiness but, in fact, he was judging the distance to the corner of  the room and the tapestry showing a nymph sprinkling her breasts with water poured from a jug. 'Dandelion,' Rience finally spoke, slipping his hand back into the pocket of his sepia-coloured tunic,  'answer my questions. Please.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"It's incredibly important to me. To you, too,  believe me, because if you answer of your own free will then-'  'Then what?'  A hideous grimace crept over Rience's narrow lips. 'Then I won't have to force you to speak.'  'Now listen, you scoundrel.' Dandelion stood up and pretended to pull a threatening face. 'I loathe  violence and force, but I'm going to call Mama Lantieri in a minute and she will call a certain Gruzila who  fulfils the honourable and responsible role of bouncer in this establishment. He is a true artist in his field.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"He is a true artist in his field. He'll kick your arse so hard you'll soar over the town roofs with such magnificence that the few people  passing by at this hour will take you for a Pegasus.'  Rience made an abrupt gesture and something glistened in his hand. 'Are you sure,' he asked, 'you'll have time to call her?'    Dandelion had no intention of checking if he would have time. Nor did he intend to wait. Before the  stiletto had locked in Rience's hand Dandelion had taken a long leap to the corner of the room, dived  under the nymph tapestry, kicked open a secret door and rushed headlong down the winding stairs,     nimbly steering himself with the aid of the well-worn banisters.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Rience was standing in front of him and his evil eyes glinted in the light of a lantern held aloft by an  unshaven ruffian who stood over six feet tall. Another ruffian, probably no shorter, stood behind him. Dandelion could hear his breathing and caught a whiff of stale sweat. It was the reeking man who tugged  on the rope looped over a roof beam and fastened to the poet's wrists. Dandelion's feet tore off the dirt floor.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Dandelion's feet tore off the dirt floor. The poet whistled through his nose, unable to do anything more. 'Enough,' Rience snapped at last - he spoke almost immediately, yet it had seemed an age to Dandelion. The bard's feet touched the ground but, despite his most heart-felt desire, he could not kneel again - the  tight drawn rope was still holding him as taut as a string. Rience came closer.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"I asked you a  question under much pleasanter circumstances than these. Now you are going to answer all my questions,  and in far less pleasant circumstances. Am I right?'  Dandelion nodded eagerly. Only now did Rience smile and make a sign. The bard squealed helplessly,  feeling the rope tighten and his arms, twisted backwards, cracking in their joints.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"You can't talk,' Rience confirmed, still smiling loathsomely, 'and it hurts, doesn't it? For the moment, you  should know I'm having you strung up like this for my own pleasure just because I love watching people  suffer. Go on, just a little higher.'  Dandelion was wheezing so hard he almost choked. 'Enough,' Rience finally ordered, then approached the poet and grabbed him by his shirt ruffles. 'Listen to  me, you little cock.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"'Listen to  me, you little cock. I'm going to lift the spell so you can talk. But if you try to raise your charming voice  any louder than necessary, you'll be sorry.'  He made a gesture with his hand, touched the poet's cheek with his ring and Dandelion felt sensation  return to his jaw, tongue and palate. 'Now,' Rience continued quietly, 'I am going to ask you a few questions and you are going to answer  them quickly, fluently and comprehensively. And if you stammer or hesitate even for a moment, if you  give me the slightest reason to doubt the truth of your words, then ...",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"I really doubt it. So I think you'll talk to me. Am I right?'  Dandelion didn't agree because he couldn't move his head or find his voice out of sheer fright. But Rience  did not seem to require confirmation. 'It is to be understood,' he stated, 'that I will know immediately if you are telling the truth, if you try to  trick me I will realise straight away, and I won't be fooled by any poetic ploys or vague erudition.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Where does he usually hide?'     'I don't know where it is,' the troubadour said quickly. 'I'm not lying. I really don't know-'  'Too quick, Dandelion, too quick.' Rience smiled ominously. 'Too eager. You are cunning but not careful  enough.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"What is the place called?'  The poet remained silent. The rope tightened, twisting his hands painfully, and his feet left the ground. Dandelion let out a howl, brief and broken because Rience's wizardly ring immediately gagged him. 'Higher, higher.' Rience rested his hands on his hips. 'You know, Dandelion, I could use magic to sound  out your mind, but it's exhausting.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"'Sir,' said the first ruffian suddenly, covering the lantern with his cloak and peering through the gap in the  pigsty door, 'someone's coming. A lass, I think.'  'You know what to do,' Rience hissed. 'Put the lantern out.'  The reeking man released the rope and Dandelion tumbled inertly to the ground, falling in such a way that  he could see the man with the lantern standing at the door and the reeking man, a long knife in his hand,  lying in wait on the other side. Light broke in from the bawdy-house through gaps in the planks, and the  poet heard the singing and hubbub. The door to the pigsty creaked open revealing a short figure wrapped in a cloak and wearing a round,  tightly fitting cap.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"The ruffian screamed  piercingly and the grim reek of burning meat filled the pigsty. Then Rience attacked. The spell he cast illuminated the darkness with a bluish flash in which Dandelion  saw a slender woman wearing man's clothes gesticulating strangely with both hands. He only glimpsed  her for a second before the blue glow disappeared with a bang and a blinding flash. Rience fell back with  a roar of fury and collapsed onto the wooden pigsty walls, breaking them with a crash.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"The woman  dressed in man's clothing leapt after him, a stiletto flashing in her hand. The pigsty filled with brightness  again - this time golden - beaming from a bright oval which suddenly appeared in the air. Dandelion saw  Rience spring up from the dusty floor, leap into the oval and immediately disappear. The oval dimmed  but, before it went out entirely, the woman ran up to it shouting incomprehensively, stretching out her  hand. Something crackled and rustled and the dying oval boiled with roaring flames for a moment.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"The poet felt the  power which gagged him disappear. 'Help!' he howled. 'Help!'  'Stop yelling, Dandelion,' said the woman, kneeling next to him and slicing through the knots with Rience's  stiletto. 'Yennefer? Is that you?'    'Surely you're not going to say you don't remember how I look.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"That cursed Rience wouldn't have spared my life. He'd have  squeezed everything from me and then butchered me like a sheep.'  'Yes, I think he would.' She poured herself and the bard some wine then raised her tumbler. 'So let's  drink to your rescue and health, Dandelion.'  And to yours, Yennefer,' he toasted her in return. 'To health for which - as of today - I shall pray  whenever the occasion arises. I'm indebted to you, beautiful lady, and I shall repay the debt in my songs.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Warned that the likes of Rience are looking for him and the little  girl? I would go, but I honestly don't know where it is ... That place whose name I prefer not to say ...'  'Get to the point, Dandelion.'     'If you know where Geralt is, you ought to go and warn him. You owe him that, Yennefer. There was,  after all, something between you.'  'Yes,' she acknowledged coldly.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"A dangerous Nilfgaardian agent, who could now be trivially  locked away in my deepest dungeon in Tretogor, has trivially escaped, trivially warned and frightened  away by the trivial stupidity of two gentlemen known as Dandelion and Geralt. I've seen people wander to  the scaffolds over lesser trivialities. Why didn't you inform me about your ambush, Dandelion? Did I not  instruct you to keep me informed about all the Geralt's intentions?'  'I didn't know anything about Geralt's plans,' Dandelion lied with conviction. 'I told you that he went to  Temeria and Sodden to hunt down this Rience.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Rience, according to the Geralt's plan, was to feel safe. Rience wasn't to smell a trap anywhere,  wasn't to spy Master Dijkstra's subordinates lying in wait for him. Because, on the Geralt's instructions,  Master Dandelion had not squealed to Master Dijkstra about the planned ambush. But according to the  instructions received, Master Dandelion was duty bound to do so. Master Dandelion had clear, explicit  instructions in this matter which he deigned to ignore.'  'I am not one of your subordinates.' The poet puffed up with pride.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"It is they who boarded the barge, they who wanted to grab  the Geralt. Perhaps as bait for Rience, perhaps for a different end. At Acorn Bay, Dandelion, the Geralt  killed Temerian agents. Their chief is very, very angry. You say Geralt has left?",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"I can pacify the Temerians. But not for nothing. Where has the Geralt gone,  Dandelion?'  'Novigrad,' the troubadour lied without thinking. 'He went to look for Rience there.'  A mistake, a mistake,' smiled the spy, pretending not to have caught the lie. 'You see what a shame it is  he didn't overcome his repulsion and get in touch with me.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"The girl with ashen hair and green eyes? The one  Rience asked you about back in Temeria when he caught and tortured you? Eh, Dandelion? What do you  know about the girl? Where has the Geralt hidden her?",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"The Redanians? Tretogor? Dijkstra?'  'You've guessed.'  'That's still no reason-'  'It's reason enough,' interrupted Dandelion. 'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt. They're after the girl and Yennefer.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"What do the Temerians want from her? What does a certain Rience, who has already murdered three people in Sodden and Temeria who were  in touch with me and the girl two years ago, want from her? Who almost murdered Dandelion trying to  extract information about her? Who is this Rience, Philippa?'  'I don't know,' said the magician. 'I don't know who Rience is.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"What do the Temerians want from her? What does a certain Rience, who has already murdered three people in Sodden and Temeria who were  in touch with me and the girl two years ago, want from her?

'I don't know who Rience is.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"And sure. Right in the eyes. He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the  charlatan's house. Rience retreated into the depths of the lane, raising and spreading  both arms in front of him, a magical light already beginning to exude from them. Geralt grasped his sword  with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him.",Blood of Elves,Dandelion,Rience
"Over here! You remember my boys, Geralt? This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and  here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.'    Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically  square in their thick quilted jerkins. 'There were six of you,' one by one he squeezed the hard, gnarled hands offered him, 'if I remember  correctly.'  'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin. 'There were six of us, indeed.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"For them alone there was just enough for one, at most two, mouthfuls each. Add some wood to the fire,' said Yarpen, licking his fingers. 'The water will heat quicker.'  'That water's a stupid idea,' stated Regan Dahlberg, spitting out a bone. 'Washing can only harm you  when you're sick. When  you're healthy, too, come to that.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"And it's dangerous. I only just managed to jump aside when you threw out the suds from the  bucket. Come on, let's go and see how many trout have jumped into Regan's breeches.'  'Yarpen?'  'Huh?'  'I like you.'  'And I like you, kid.'  'But you're a dwarf. And I'm not.'  'And what diff- Ah, the Scoia'tael. You're thinking about the Squirrels, aren't you?",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"Cloaks and beaver hats can be pretty  quick to change owners.'  The riders approached swiftly. There were about ten of them. Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"She tore her feet from the stirrups, jumped up, squatted in the saddle, bounced off  strongly and leaped. She fell softly on the body of the overturned wagon, used her hands to balance herself and jumped again,  landing with bent knees next to Yarpen who was roaring and brandishing his axe. Next to them, on the  second wagon, Paulie Dahlberg was fighting while Regan, leaning back and bracing his legs against the  board, was struggling to hold on to the harnessed horses. They neighed wildly, stamped their hooves and  yanked at the shaft in fear of the fire devouring the canvas. She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and  started to drag her towards the overturned wagon.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering. Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons. The fighters were suddenly parted by Regan's span as he struggled in the coachman's box with a halfling  wearing a lynx fur hat. The halfling was sitting on Regan trying to jab him with a long knife. Yarpen deftly leaped onto the wagon, caught the halfling by the neck and kicked him overboard.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"Regan  gave a piercing yell, grabbed the reins and lashed the horses. The span jerked, the wagon rolled and  gathered speed in a flash. 'Circle, Regan!' roared Yarpen. 'Circle! Go round!'  The wagon turned and descended on the elves again, parting them.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"'Come on then, you whoresons!' Yarpen roared, whirling his axe. 'Who else? Chase a circle, Regan! Go  round!'  Regan, tossing his bloodied mane of hair, hunched in the box amidst the whizzing of arrows, howled like  the damned, and mercilessly lashed the horses on. The span dashed in a tight circle,  creating a moving barricade belching flames and smoke around the overturned wagon beneath which Ciri  had dragged the semiconscious, battered magician.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"Yarpen Zigrin did not look at him. He was looking at the dead. At Regan  Dahlberg still kneeling over his brother. 'It was necessary, Zigrin,' said the knight. 'This is war.",Blood of Elves,Regan,Yarpen
"The  emigrants persist in their search for her ... Because they need someone of royal blood to sit on their  regained throne. Someone of Calanthe's blood.'  'Nonsense,' said Foltest coldly. 'More than two years have passed. If the child has not been found by    now, she's dead.",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"'Free, independent and strong. A country which will be an  iron gateway, a bulwark to the north, and not a strip of burned ground over which the Nilfgaardian  cavalry will be able to gather speed!'  'Is it possible to rebuild such a Cintra? Without Calanthe?'  'Don't get all worked up, Foltest,' pouted Meve. 'I've already told you, the Cintrians will never accept a  protectorate or foreign blood on their throne. If you try to force yourself on them as their lord the tables  will be turned.",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"And  one day those detachments are going to assail us in the vanguard of a Nilfgaardian onslaught. As the  spear point, as you just vividly described it.'  'Foltest knows that,' snorted Vizimir. 'That's why he's searching so hard for this Lion Cub, for Calanthe's  granddaughter. Don't you understand? Blood not water, the crown through marriage.",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"'Our king has thought up a cunning little plan for  himself! We assail the left bank and before we realise it our Foltest will have found the girl, won her heart  and have a young wife whom he will place on the throne of Cintra while her people cry for joy and pee in  their knickers for happiness. For they will have their queen, blood of the blood and flesh of the flesh of  Calanthe. They will have a queen ... albeit one who comes with a king.",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"While we are  on the subject, is a gentleman by the name of Rience in any of your services? Ah, I see from your  expressions that either he isn't or you won't admit it - which comes to the same thing. I repeat: they are  searching for Calanthe's granddaughter, and searching in such a way as to make you think twice about  their intentions. Who is looking for her, I ask?'  'Hell!' Foltest thumped his fist on the table. 'It's not me!",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"Then leave Foltest in peace  for a moment. There are others. In her time, Calanthe wanted to give her granddaughter's hand to Ervyll  of Verden's son. Ervyll, too, might have caught a whiff of Cintra. And not just him ...'  'Hmm ...' muttered Vizimir.",Blood of Elves,Calanthe,Foltest
"There were rats here, too; they flitted under the walls, squeaked from  the dark abyss, from the branching passages, and skittered before the swaying circle of light thrown by  the torch. Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs. A gleam was visible below them.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"What's more, she saw nothing of what she had  expected in those eyes. 'Welcome,' he repeated. 'We are glad you've come.'  Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the  long scar which disfigured his cheek. And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen Geralts, Lambert, was  there with his usual ugly, mocking expression. Vesemir was not there.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"They changed the subject at once. She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"And maybe  even more.'  'The devil take it,' cursed Coen. 'We've turned out to be right idiots, there's no two ways about it, eh,  Vesemir, and you' Silence,' growled the old Geralt. 'Not a word.'  It was Eskel's behaviour which was most unlikely; he got up, approached the enchantress, bent down  low, took her hand and kissed it respectfully. She swiftly withdrew her hand. Not so as to demonstrate  her anger and annoyance but to break the pleasant, piercing vibration triggered by the Geralt's touch.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"Help  us, Triss.'  The enchantress looked him in the eye and pursed her lips. 'With what? What am I to help you with,  Eskel?'  Eskel rubbed his cheek again, looked at Geralt. The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling. Vesemir hawked again. But Eskel, dear Eskel, kept his head and once more behaved as was fitting. 'Of course,' he said casually, smiling. 'We understand and clearly  we will postpone your exercises until your indisposition has passed.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"'To think I didn't believe that she really is a princess.'  'Have you understood, you idiots?' Vesemir cast his eye around. 'If she puts a dress on in the morning I  don't want to see any exercises ... Understood?'  Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man. Lambert snorted  loudly. Geralt stared at the enchantress and the enchantress smiled back.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place. Duplicity was a character flaw to he ashamed of.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf. Triss knew the medallion reacted to magic.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"In a minute it'll be the end of Midinvaerne. As of tomorrow, every day brings spring  closer!'  'I'm thirsty.' Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice. Eskel deftly moved the vessel  beyond her reach and grabbed a jug of water. Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"Geralt, a hand on his forehead, did not say a word. Vesemir nodded, from time to time throwing in  comments which amounted to little more than that 'in his day' everything had been better, more logical,  more honest and healthier. Eskel pretended to be polite, and neither smiled nor made eye contact, and  even managed, very occasionally, to be interested in some issue or question of little importance. Coen  yawned openly and looked at the ceiling, and Lambert did nothing to hide his disdain. They did not want to know anything, they cared nothing for  dilemmas which drove sleep from kings, wizards, rulers and leaders, or for the problems which made  councils, circles and gatherings tremble and buzz.",Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
The lady magician knew a surprising amount about a Geralt's sword and 'dance'. She knew a great deal  about the secrets of Kaer Morhen; there was no doubt she had visited the Keep. She knew Vesemir and  Eskel. Although not Lambert and Coen. Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen.,Blood of Elves,Eskel,Vesemir
"Over here! You remember my boys, Geralt? This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and  here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.'    Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically  square in their thick quilted jerkins. 'There were six of you,' one by one he squeezed the hard, gnarled hands offered him, 'if I remember  correctly.'  'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin. 'There were six of us, indeed.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"Yarpen stood up in the box and, swearing in both human  and dwarvish, whistling and roaring, brought the cart to a halt. Dwarves and humans alike, leaping from  their wagons, ran up and helped lead the horses to the clear path, tugging them on by their halters and  harnesses. 'Dozing off, eh Yarpen?' growled Paulie Dahlberg as he approached. 'Bloody hell, if you'd ridden over  that the axle would be done for, and the wheels shattered to hell. Damn it, what were you-'  'Piss off, Paulie!' roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"Oh, look at you, it's full to the brim! Did you lug this great weight from the stream by  yourself?'  'I'm strong.'  The elder of the Dahlberg brothers burst out laughing. 'Don't judge her by appearances, Paulie,' said Yarpen seriously as he skilfully divided the roasted grey  hare into portions. 'There's nothing to laugh at here. She's skinny but I can see she's a robust and resilient  lass.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"I'm constantly amazed. Hey,  Zigrin, if you had a woman would you wash her and comb her hair? Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen

"Prisoners?' sneered Yannick Brass, sprawled in the coachman's box. 'I am asking you what's in them, so answer me!'  'Salt fish.'  'And in those trunks there?' The warrior rode up to the next wagon and kicked the side. 'Hooves,' snapped Paulie Dahlberg. 'And there, in the back, are buffalo skins.'  'So I see.' The lance-corporal waved his hand, smacked his lips at his horse, rode up to the vanguard  and peered into Yarpen's wagon. 'And who is that woman lying there?'  Triss Merigold smiled weakly, raised herself to her elbow and traced a short, complicated sign with her  hand.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"Ha, she thought, looking around, the safety of the entire  convoy depends on me now. They're all waiting impatiently for me to return and report: the way is clear  and passable, I didn't see anyone - there are no traces of wheels or hooves. I'll report it, and thin  Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow,  horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly. He'll smile,  although he very rarely smiles recently. Ciri looked around and took a mental note.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"'Did you prick yourself?'  'Yarpen ...' whispered the girl, looking at the blood filling her life-line. 'Wenck ... Paulie ...'  'What?'  'Triss!' she shouted with a piercing voice which was not hers, shuddered fiercely and wiped her face with  her arm. 'Quick, Geralt! We've got to help!",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen

"The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon. Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found  himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the    charging Scoia'tael. All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses  snorting, hooves clattering. Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like  raging demons.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"He struck with both arms. The blade of the axe whirred  and fell, slicing into the collar-bone with a hideous crunch. Paulie fell instantly, without a moan; it looked  as if the force of the blow had broken both his knees. Ciri screamed. Yarpen Zigrin leaped from the wagon.",Blood of Elves,Paulie,Yarpen
"Quick!'  Vilfrid Wenck, crossing his arms, hawked loudly. 'We're on the trail,' Yarpen Zigrin said sharply, without looking at him. 'You don't refuse help on the  Trail.'  'Damn it.' Yarpen removed his palm from Triss's forehead. 'She's as hot as a furnace. I don't like it.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Will the young lady accept it or will she send the old boor, Yarpen  Zigrin, away?'  'I'm sorry ... Ciri had second thoughts and lowered her head. 'Triss really does need help, Master ... Zigrin. She's very sick.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"'Impossible. Crushed garlic and  bitter salt has no right to slink, even if it's a hundred years old.'  'It's foul, uugghh. Triss won't eat that!'  'We'll use my grandmother's method.

'It's medicine!' The dwarf took offence.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Geralt, it really ought to help . . .'  'See?' Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who  swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression. 'A wise magician. Knows what's good for her.'  'What are you saying, Triss?' The Geralt leaned over.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"I've brought you some water and a little food-'  'Thank you. But they both need rest above all. Ciri, lie down.'  'I'll just make up a compress for Triss-'  'I'll do it myself. Yarpen, I'd like to talk to you.'  'Come to the fire. We'll broach a barrel-'  'I want to talk to you.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Wenck is a quartermaster to the king's army.'  'If he's quartermaster then I'm a druid,' smiled Geralt. 'But that's your affair - I'm not in the habit of  poking my nose into other people's secrets. But you can see the state Triss is in. Let us join you, Yarpen,  let us put her in one of the wagons. Just for a few days.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Yarpen Zigrin ran the length of the column, giving orders and instructions loudly, after which he  clambered onto the coachman's box, shouted and whipped the horses with the reins. The wagon jolted  and rattled along the forest trail. The bump woke Triss up but Ciri reassured her and changed the  compress on her forehead. The rattling had a soporific effect and the magician was soon asleep; Ciri, too, fell to dozing. When she woke the sun was already high.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"She also saw Wenck  riding a horse, in the company of two bailiffs. Roach, Geralt's mare, tethered to the wagon, greeted her with a quiet neigh. She couldn't see her  chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun. No doubt they were at the rear, with the convoy's spare horses. Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Yarpen,  ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few  wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company  was a considerable help. Geralt was surprised that the aid had to be quite so secretive, to which the  dwarf replied that was why the secret was a secret. Triss tossed in her sleep, shook the compress off and talked indistinctly to herself. She demanded that  someone called Kevyn kept his hands to himself, and immediately after that declared that destiny cannot  be avoided. Finally, having stated that everyone, absolutely everyone, is a mutant to a certain degree, she  fell into a peaceful sleep.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-'  'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach. 'Restrain yourself a little, if you please, with your choice  of words. And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake  and needs anything.'  'I've been awake for a long time,' the magician said weakly from the depths of the wagon. 'But I didn't  want to ... interrupt this interesting conversation.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"I'd like ... to learn more  about the role of screwing in the evolution of society.'  'Can I heat some water? Triss wants to wash.'  'Go ahead,' agreed Yarpen Zigrin. 'Xavier, take the spit off the fire, our hare's had enough. Hand me the  cauldron, Ciri.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Would you carry her into the bushes  if she had to-'  'Shut up, Paulie.' Yarpen cut him short. 'Don't say anything against that Geralt, because he's a good  fellow.'  'Am I saying anything? I'm only surprised-'  'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.'  'I'm all the more surprised.'  'You're all the more a blockhead, you mean,' Yarpen summed up. 'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil. We'll infuse some more saffron and poppy seeds for the magician.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"The dwarf poured the water into the bucket. 'Need any help, Geralt?'  'No, thank you, Yarpen. Ciri will help.'  Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak. Geralt and Ciri were, by  now, efficient at undressing and washing her. They had also learned to temper her ambitious but, at  present, unrealistic attempts to manage on her own.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"It would be entirely different ... I could ... I  could even-'  'Triss.'  'I envy Yennefer ... I envy her you-'  'Ciri, step out.'  'But-'  'Go, please.'  She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and   pensively chewing a blade of grass. The dwarf put his arm around her.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely. 'Get off the box and get in the back! Stay with Triss.'  'I can't see anything from there!'  'Don't argue!' growled Yarpen. 'Scuttle back there and be quick about it! And hand me the martel.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon  behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak. Ciri crept  stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back. Triss tried to raise herself,  swore and collapsed against her bedding. 'Halt!' shouted the first of the riders, no doubt their leader. Who are you?",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"'Hooves,' snapped Paulie Dahlberg. 'And there, in the back, are buffalo skins.'  'So I see.' The lance-corporal waved his hand, smacked his lips at his horse, rode up to the vanguard  and peered into Yarpen's wagon. 'And who is that woman lying there?'  Triss Merigold smiled weakly, raised herself to her elbow and traced a short, complicated sign with her  hand. 'Who am I?' she asked in a quiet voice. 'But you can't see me at all.'  The soldier winked nervously, shuddered slightly.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"'Did you prick yourself?'  'Yarpen ...' whispered the girl, looking at the blood filling her life-line. 'Wenck ... Paulie ...'  'What?'  'Triss!' she shouted with a piercing voice which was not hers, shuddered fiercely and wiped her face with  her arm. 'Quick, Geralt! We've got to help!",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Next to them, on the  second wagon, Paulie Dahlberg was fighting while Regan, leaning back and bracing his legs against the  board, was struggling to hold on to the harnessed horses. They neighed wildly, stamped their hooves and  yanked at the shaft in fear of the fire devouring the canvas. She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and  started to drag her towards the overturned wagon. The enchantress moaned, holding her head just above  the ear. Right by Ciri's side, hooves suddenly clattered and horses snorted - two elves, brandishing their  swords, were pressing the madly fighting Yarpen hard.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"The dwarf fell. At that moment the  flaming wagon crashed into those  still fighting, parting and scattering them. Ciri barely managed to pull Triss out from beneath the crazed  horses' hooves at the last moment. The swingle-tree tore away with a crack, the wagon leaped into the  air, lost a wheel and overturned, scattering its load and smouldering boards everywhere. Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"Thanks to the troops from Ban Glean which came to our aid.'  'You weren't ...' she whispered, closing her eyes, 'you weren't neutral ...'  'No, I wasn't. But you're alive. Triss is alive.'  'How is she?'  'She hit her head falling out of the wagon when Yarpen tried to rescue it. But she's fine now. Treating the  wounded.'  Ciri cast her eyes around.",Blood of Elves,Triss,Yarpen
"'Let us call a convention and remind them to whom they owe  first loyalty. Note that even some members of our Council now advise kings. The kings are served by  Carduin, Philippa Eilhart, Fercart, Radcliffe, Yennefer-'  At the last name Vilgefortz twitched internally. But Tissaia de Vries was an Archmage. Tissaia sensed the  thought, the impulse  leaping from the workbench and magical apparatus to the two volumes lying on the table.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"Fercart and Yennefer. Fercart, as far as I know, is tied to  Foltest of Temeria and sits on the king's council with Triss Merigold. But who is Yennefer tied to? You  said, Artaud, that she is one of those who are serving kings.'  'Artaud exaggerated,' said Tissaia calmly. 'Yennefer is living in Vengerberg so Demawend sometimes  turns to her for help, but they do not work together all the time.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"You know, I wanted to contact her but it turned out she had left. No one knew where for.'  Stone, metal, crystal, thought Tissaia de Vries. 'Everything that Yennefer wears is active and cannot be  detected using psychic visions. You won't find her that way, my dear. If Yennefer does not wish anyone  to know where she is, no one will find out.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"'And send the letter in the ordinary way. It will  get there without fail. And Yennefer, wherever she is, will reply. She always does.'  'Yennefer,' threw in Artaud, 'frequently disappears, sometimes for entire months. The reasons tend to be  quite trivial ...'  Tissaia looked at him, pursing her lips.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"Geralt, if I'm not mistaken. It seems it wasn't just an ordinary passing affair. It appeared Yennefer was  quite strongly involved ...'  Tissaia de Vries sat up straight and gripped the armrests of her chair. 'Why are you asking about that? They're personal matters.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"'It is none of our business. But  I'm not being guided by unhealthy curiosity but concern about the emotional state of a member of the  Council. I am wondering about Yennefer's reaction to the news of ... of Geralt's death. I presume she  would get over it, come to terms with it, without falling into a depression or exaggerated mourning?'  'No doubt, she would,' said Tissaia coldly.",Blood of Elves,Yennefer,Tissaia
"Rain battered against the windows throughout the prolonged silence,  and the wind howled and pounded against the shutters. 'All the worries of which we talk,' said Henselt finally, 'is the work of Nilfgaard. It is Emhyr's emissaries  who are inciting the non-humans, spreading propaganda and calling for riots. It is they who are throwing  gold around and promising privileges to corporations and guilds, assuring barons and dukes they will  receive high positions in the provinces they plan to create in place of our kingdoms. I don't know what it's  like in your countries, but in Kaedwen we've been inundated with clerics, preachers, fortunetellers and  other shitty mystics all appearing out of the blue, all preaching the end of the world ...'  'It's the same in my country,' agreed Foltest.",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"They are ready to strike the left bank. They  await only the battle cry.'  'The battle cry,' bore out Meve, 'and the promise that we will back them up. Because Emhyr can  command eight thousand men at his border garrison; with that strength he won't even have to send for  relief troops. Vissegerd knows this very well and won't move until he has the assurance that your armies,  Foltest, reinforced by Redanian corps, will disembark on the left bank at his heels. But above all  Vissegerd is waiting for the Lion Cub of Cintra.",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"'I've already told you, the Cintrians will never accept a  protectorate or foreign blood on their throne. If you try to force yourself on them as their lord the tables  will be turned. Vissegerd will again prepare his troops for battle, but this time under Emhyr's wings. And  one day those detachments are going to assail us in the vanguard of a Nilfgaardian onslaught. As the  spear point, as you just vividly described it.'  'Foltest knows that,' snorted Vizimir.",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"But Ervyll of  Verden ... It's not so far from him.'  'There is someone else who is just as near,' remarked Demawend suddenly. 'Who?'  'Emhyr var Emreis. He is not married. And he is younger than you, Foltest.'  'Bloody hell.' The King of Redania frowned.",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"And he is younger than you, Foltest.'  'Bloody hell.' The King of Redania frowned. 'If that were true ... Emhyr would bugger us without grease! It's obvious that the people and nobility of Cintra will follow Calanthe's blood. Imagine what would  happen if Emhyr were to get his hands on the Lion Cub?",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"What does Emhyr need the girl for, what the hell  does he need to get married for? The throne of Cintra? Emhyr already has Cintra! He conquered the  country and made it a province of Nilfgaard! He's got his whole butt on the throne and still has enough  room to wriggle about!'  'Firstly,' noted Foltest, 'Emhyr grips Cintra by law, or rather by an aggressor's lawlessness.",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"'Nor in mine. Vissegerd is a tool, not a partner, that's the role he is to play in  our plans for attacking Nilfgaard - that and no other. Besides, if the one who is so earnestly seeking the  Lion Cub is indeed Emhyr var Emreis, we cannot take the risk.'  'Absolutely not,' seconded Foltest. 'The Lion Cub cannot fall into Emhyr's hands. She cannot fall into  anybody's- Into the wrong hands ...",Blood of Elves,Emhyr,Foltest
"'Jarre,  are you there? Hey! It's me!'  'Ciri?' The boy leaned out. 'What are you doing here?'  'Can I come up and see you?'  'Now? Hmm ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Please do.'  She flew up the stairs like a hurricane, catching the novice unexpectedly just as, with his back turned, he  was quickly adjusting his clothes and hiding some parchments on the table under other parchments. Jarre  ran his fingers through his hair, cleared his throat and bowed awkwardly. Ciri slipped her thumbs into her  belt and tossed her ashen fringe. 'What's this war everybody's talking about?' she fired. 'I want to know!'  'Please, have a seat.'  She cast her eyes around the chamber.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Just a  moment, wait, I'll take those books ... Does Lady Yennefer know you're here?'  'No.'  'Hmm ... Or Mother Nenneke?'  Ciri pulled a face. She knew what he meant. The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward,  being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward,  being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler. He lived in Ellander where he worked as a scribe at  the municipal tribunal, but he spent more time in Melitele's sanctuary than in the town, studying, copying  and illuminating volumes in the Temple library for whole days and sometimes even nights. Ciri had never  heard it from Nenneke's lips but it was well known that the high priestess absolutely did not want Jarre to  hang around her young novices. And vice-versa. But the novices, however, did sneak keen glances at the  boy and chatted freely, discussing the various possibilities presented by the presence on the Temple  grounds of something which wore trousers.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"In Cintra, as she remembered, an  attractive man was one whose head reached the ceiling, whose shoulders were as broad as a doorway,  who swore like a dwarf, roared like a buffalo and stank at thirty paces of horses, sweat and beer,  regardless of what time of day or night it was. Men who did not correspond to this description were not  recognised by Queen Calanthe's chambermaids as worthy of sighs and gossip. Ciri had also seen a  number of different men the wise and gentle druids of Angren, the tall and gloomy settlers of Sodden, the  Geralts of Kaer Morhen. Jarre was different. He was as skinny as a stick-insect, ungainly, wore clothes  which were too large and smelled of ink and dust, always had greasy hair and on his chin, instead of  stubble, there were seven or eight long hairs, about half of which sprang from a large wart.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"The army is marching the  highways out of boredom? Don't twist things, Jarre. You visit the town and castle, you must know    something!'  'Why don't you ask Lady Yennefer about it?'  'Lady Yennefer has more important things to worry about!' Ciri spat, but then immediately had second  thoughts, smiled pleasantly and fluttered her eyelashes. 'Oh, Jarre, tell me, please! You're so clever!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"You  can talk so beautifully and learnedly, I could listen to you for hours! Please, Jarre!'  The boy turned red and his eyes grew unfocused and bleary. Ciri sighed surreptitiously. 'Hmm ...' Jarre shuffled from foot to foot and moved his arms undecidedly, evidently not knowing what  to do with them. What can I tell you?",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Don't touch it.' Jarre was worried. 'It's an exceptionally valuable and unique work.'  'I'm not going to eat it.'  'Your hands are dirty.'  'They're cleaner than yours. Listen, do you have any maps here?'  'I do, but they're hidden in the chest,' said the boy quickly, but seeing Ciri pull a face, he sighed, pushed  the scrolls of parchment off the chest, lifted the lid and started to rummage through the contents. Ciri,  wriggling in the chair and swinging her legs, carried on flicking through the book. From between the  pages suddenly slipped a loose page with a picture of a woman, completely naked with her hair curled  into ringlets, entangled in an embrace with a completely naked bearded man.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Well, go on. Show me that map!'  They both knelt on the floor, holding down the stiff sheet, which was stubbornly trying to roll up again,  with their hands and knees. Ciri finally weighed down one corner with a chair leg and Jarre pressed  another down with a hefty book entitled The Life and Deeds of Great King Radovid. 'Hmm ... This map is so unclear!",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Those kingdoms, like Cintra and Upper Sodden, the Nilfgaardians now call the Provinces. But they didn't manage to dominate Lower Sodden, Verden and Brugge. Here, on the Yaruga, the  armies of the Four Kingdoms held them back, defeating them in battle-'  'I know, I studied history.' Ciri slapped the map with her open palm. Well, Jarre, tell me about the  war. We're kneeling on  political geography.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Jarre! Stop  that immediately!'  The boy abruptly pulled his lips away from her hair and went as red as a beetroot. '1 do not wish you to do that to me!'  'Ciri, I '  'I came to you with a serious matter, as a wizard to a scholar,' she said icily and with dignity, in a tone of  voice which exactly copied that of Yennefer. 'So behave!'  The 'scholar' blushed an even deeper shade and had such a stupid expression on his face that the 'wizard'  could barely keep herself from laughing. He leaned over the map once more.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"And through Pontar Valley to us, to Temeria.'  And what happened there?'  'There was fighting. Apparently. I don't know much about it, but that's what they're saying at the castle.'  'If there was fighting,' frowned Ciri, 'there's a war already! So what are you talking about?'  'It's not the first time there's been fighting,' clarified Jarre, but the girl saw that he was less and less sure of  himself. 'Incidents at the border are very frequent.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"I'm off. Take care, Jarre.'  'Goodbye ... Ciri. Have a safe journey. I'll ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"The magician put the comb aside but, lost in thought, kept gazing through the window at the swarms of  ravens and crows croaking horrifically as they flew east. On the table, next to the mirror and an  impressive array of bottled cosmetics, lay several letters. Ciri knew that Yennefer had been waiting for  them a long time and that the day on which they were to leave the Temple depended on her receiving  these letters. In spite of what she had told Jarre, the girl had no idea where and why they were leaving. But in those letters ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"Physiologically, that is to say. Surely you've not forgotten  what we talked about?'  'No. I haven't.'  When you visit Jarre I hope there aren't any problems with your memory either?'  Ciri lowered her eyes, but only momentarily. Yennefer did not smile. 'Dry yourself and come here,' she said coolly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"But Nenneke doesn't like it. You know that.'  'But I haven't ... I don't care about Jarre in the least.' Ciri blushed a little. 'I only ...'  'Exactly,' muttered the enchantress. 'You only.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"I don't know what to think myself any more. I don't know what these analogies are,  probably something terribly clever ... Jarre reads various learned books and knows it all, but I think ...'  'It interests me, what you think, Ciri.'  'In Cintra ... That time ... Lady Yennefer, my grandmother was much cleverer than Jarre.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Jarre
"I'm closing the inner gates to stop the heat  escaping.'  They walked along the corridor. There were rats here, too; they flitted under the walls, squeaked from  the dark abyss, from the branching passages, and skittered before the swaying circle of light thrown by  the torch. Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men. 'Who's wintering here, Eskel? Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Apart from Vesemir?'  'Lambert and Coen.'  They descended a steep and slippery flight of stairs. A gleam was visible below them. Ciri heard voices,  detected the smell of smoke. The hall was enormous, and flooded with light from a huge hearth roaring with flames which were being  sucked up into the heart of the chimney. The centre of the hall was taken up by an enormous, heavy  table.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"We've been waiting for you.'  'Greetings, Vesemir. Greetings, lads. It's good to be home again.'  'Who have you brought us?'  Geralt was silent for a moment, then put his hand on Ciri's shoulder and lightly pushed her forward. She  walked awkwardly, hesitantly, huddled up and hunched, her head lowered. I'm frightened, she thought.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"He had unusually pale, yellow-green irises and the whites of his eyes, riddled  with red threads, indicated difficult and troublesome processes during his mutation. 'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm. 'A stable is no place to welcome a guest, but I  couldn't wait to see you.'  In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's  instructions. Deftly balancing on a beam hanging on chains, she was attacking - with her sword -a leather  sack bound with straps to make it resemble a human torso. Triss stopped to watch.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"She had watched them. Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely  merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural. The only one who had been sincere and open  was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious. They had eaten beer  potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as  well. They had drunk cider, but the girl had been given water and was clearly both astonished and  revolted by it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Finish your food; it's time for training. The days are getting shorter.'  'Geralt.' Triss finished her porridge. 'Ciri fell on the Trail yesterday. Nothing serious, but it was because  of that jester's outfit she wears. It all fits so badly, and it hinders her movements.'  Vesemir cleared his throat and turned his eyes away.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"It all fits so badly, and it hinders her movements.'  Vesemir cleared his throat and turned his eyes away. Aha,  thought the enchantress, so it's your work, master of the sword. Predictable enough, Ciri's short tunic  does look as if it has been cut out with a knife and sewn together with an arrow-head. 'The days are, indeed, getting shorter,' she continued, not waiting for a comment. 'But we're going to  make today shorter still.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"She hasn't got  a single healthy spot on her body!'  'Dear child,' said Vesemir gravely, 'don't let yourself get carried away by your emotions. You were  brought up differently, you've seen children being brought up in another way. Ciri comes from the south  where girls and boys are brought up in the same way, like the elves. She was put on a pony when she  was five and when she was eight she was already riding out hunting. She was taught to use a bow, javelin  and sword.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"The white-haired Geralt bowed his head, hiding his  eyes behind his hand. Vesemir cleared his throat loudly. At that moment, the door creaked open and Ciri entered the hall. Vesemir's hawking changed into  something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath. Lambert opened his mouth.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Lambert opened his mouth. Triss suppressed a laugh. Ciri, her hair cut and styled, was walking towards them with tiny steps, carefully holding up a dark-blue  dress - shortened and adjusted, and still showing the signs of having been carried in a saddle-bag. Another present from the enchantress gleamed around the girl's neck - a little black viper made of  lacquered leather with a ruby eye and gold clasp. Ciri stopped in front of Vesemir.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"I am ...'  She looked at the enchantress. Triss winked at her, smirking like a rascal well pleased with his mischief,  and moved her lips to prompt the memorised lines. 'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling. Vesemir hawked again. But Eskel, dear Eskel, kept his head and once more behaved as was fitting.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"We will also cut the theory short and,  if you feel unwell, we will put it aside for the time being, too. If you need any medication or-'  'I'll take care of that,' Triss cut in just as casually. 'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old Geralt. 'Uncle Vesemir, I've asked  Triss ... that is, Miss Merigold, to ...",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"I will give you three pieces of  advice, and you are going to abide by each of them. If, of course, you really want me to stay and help  you bring up the little one.'  'We're listening,' said Geralt. 'Go on, Triss.'  'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied. And the secret mushrooms  and mysterious greens in particular have to be limited.'  Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not  at all. But then, she thought, looking at his comically embarrassed expression, in his days the world was a  better place.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"CHAPTER THREE   'Your fears were unfounded, entirely ungrounded.' Triss grimaced, resting her elbows on the table. 'The  time when wizards used to hunt Sources and magically gifted children, tearing them from their parents or  guardians by force or deceit, is long gone. Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?'  Lambert snorted and turned his face away. Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing. He continued to gaze off to the side, playing incessantly with his silver Geralt medallion, depicting the  head of a snarling wolf.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"She is  not so remarkable as to make us fall on our knees and raise our eyes to the heavens. Is there a lack of  female warriors roaming the world? I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong  and able to face life. And, I warrant, without catatonia or any other epilepsy. Unless you delude her into  believing she has some such disease.'  'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.'  'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Look.'  He stretched his hand towards the hearth, arranging his fingers together in a strange way. The chimney  roared and howled, the flames burst out violently, the glowing embers grew brighter and rained sparks. Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular  fireworks. Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly. 'The Sign of Aard,' she stated calmly.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"She has asked you a number of times not to. Second, Triss is not exaggerating. I saw Ciri's  mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes. I tell you, it was really something. I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"I don't know if  she was a Source or not, but no one suspected she had any power at all until, save by a hair's breadth,  she almost reduced the royal castle of Cintra to ashes.'  'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri  could, indeed, be genetically burdened.'  'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened. On the one hand Lambert is right. Ciri is not capable  of forming Signs. On the other ... We have all seen ...'  He fell silent and looked at Ciri who, with a joyful squeal, acknowledged that she had the upper hand in  the game.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"And what she  foretold ...'  'What? What, Geralt?'  'Death,' Vesemir said gently. 'Death, child.'     Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating. Coen put his arms around her and burst  out laughing. The magician suddenly realised that she had never, up until now, heard any of the Geralts  laugh.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"'Confused. Don't ask about it, Triss. We are not worried by  the contents of Ciri's prophecies and ravings but about what happens to her. We're not afraid for  ourselves but-'  'Careful,' warned Vesemir. 'Don't talk about it in front of her.'  Coen approached the table carrying the girl piggy-back.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Triss stood quickly. 'Here you are.' She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and  looking Vesemir in the eye. 'Drink.'  'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing? It's-'  'Not a word, please.'  They did not have to wait long for it to take effect. Ciri suddenly grew rigid, cried out, and smiled a  broad, happy smile.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"'Child ...' groaned Vesemir. 'What are you doing?'  'I know what I'm doing,' she said sharply. 'Ciri has fallen into a trance and I am going to contact her  psychically. I am going to enter her. I told you, she is something like a magical transmitter -I've got to  know what she is transmitting, how, and from where she is drawing the aura, how she is transforming it.",Blood of Elves,Ciri,Vesemir
"Killing them does not upset the order and interconnections of nature  which prevail in our present sphere. In this sphere these monsters are foreign and there is no place for  them.

"I cannot pull out  the arrow!'    They helped her. Dorregaray groaned and shuddered, the stairs where also shaking. Geralt initially  thought it was the magic of Marti's healing spells.

"Do you think that I  only hire dwarves? Oi, Wilfi! Call Fabio here, lively!'   'Ciri,' the sorceress came up to her and whispered, 'don't get any foolish ideas, please. Don't cause  me any shame. And keep your mouth shut when you're with that clerk, understood?",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"If you are  close to someone sensitive to magic you will not conceal yourself but rather reveal your presence. Ah,  and here you can have... in case you want to buy anything.'   'Thank you, Mistress Yenenfer.' Ciri put the amulet and coins to the sack and stared curiously at  the boy entering the office. The boy had freckles and wavy auburn hair, reaching the collar of his grey  uniform. 'Fabio Sachs,' Giancardi announced.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'Fabio, this is Lady Yennefer, our honourable guest and client. And this young lady, her pupil,  wishes to tour the town. You will accompany her, guide and protect her.'    The boy bowed again, this time in the direction of Ciri. 'Ciri,' said Yennefer coldly. 'Stand up, please.'   She complied, surprised, knowing the customs enough to be aware that such gesture isn't required  of her.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"This young clerk will be of  great use to you in the future. Indeed, a diamond in the rough. Ciri, I entrust you to the care of Fabio,  son of Fabio, for it is a man of honour and can be relied on.'   The boy flushed red as a tomato. Ciri realised that she had too. 'Fabio,' the dwarf opened a casket, rummaging through its contents.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"In case the young lady has any wishes. If she doesn't have any, you will return  them. Now, off you go.'   'Noon, Ciri,' reminded Yennefer. 'Not a second later.'   'I know, I know.'      ***      'I'm Fabio,' said the boy, once they ran down the stairs onto a busy street. 'And your name is Ciri,  right?'   'Yes.'   'What would you like to see in Gors Velen, Ciri?",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"But before that, we'll climb up the  wall, from which you can see the whole Bay and the famous Thanedd Island. What do you think?'   'Let's go.'   The street was full of rumbling carts hauled by horses and oxen; coopers rolling barrels; noise and  haste. The disorder made Ciri a bit dizzy – clumsily, she stepped down the wooden pavement and fell  ankle-high into mud and manure. Fabio offered his hand but she rejected the help. 'I can walk by myself!'   'Hmm...",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"It's plain at first sight!'   'It is? How?'    'She's very beautiful,' answered Fabio with the cruel, disarming honesty of a youth. Ciri spun  abruptly, but before she had a chance to retort with a biting remark alluding to his height and freckles,  the boy was already dragging her between the trolleys, barrels and stalls, while explaining that the  turret adjoining the square is called The Thief's Tower, that it was built of stones found at the bottom  of the sea, and that the trees growing beneath it are called sycamores. 'You sure are quiet, Ciri,' he noticed after a while. 'Me?' she feigned surprise.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"The stairs are over  there.'   The wall was high and the stairs were narrow. Fabio had a hard time catching his breath, as he  never stopped talking. Ciri was informed that the wall surrounding Gors Velen was a fairly new  construction, much younger than the town itself, which had been built by the elves; that it was thirty  five feet tall and that this type of a construction was called a casemate wall, made of hewn stone and  adobe brick, because this sort of material was best-suited to withstand blows from a battering ram. Cool marine wind blew at the top. Ciri gladly inhaled it after the thick air of the town.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"I don't know  why it doesn't fall off the rock... What is the name of this palace?'   'This is Aretuza, the one you were asking about. That's where the famous school of sorceresses is.'   'Ah,' Ciri licked her lips. 'So that's where... Fabio?'   'Yes?'   'How often do you see the students of this school?",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"The one the wagons are at? That's the road to Hirundum. About  fifteen miles, through the woods.'   'Fifteen miles', Ciri repeated after him. 'Not far for a good horse... Thank you, Fabio.'   'What for?'   'Never mind.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"Thank you, Fabio.'   'What for?'   'Never mind. Now take me to the market. You promised.'   'Let's go then.'   Ciri had never before seen such a hustle and bustle like the one at the square in Gors Velen. The  noisy fish market they had just crossed seemed quiet as a temple in comparison. The square itself was  gigantic and yet so crowded that it appeared as if they would only be able to see it from afar, because  getting anywhere close to it would be miracle.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'What is this wonderful smell?'   'Doughnuts,' Fabio groped the pouch. 'Do you wish to try one?'   'I wish to try two.'   The vendor handed three doughnuts, took a fiver and gave a change of four pennies, one broken in  half. Ciri watched the breaking of the penny, hungrily devouring the first doughnut. 'Is this,' she asked, while reaching for the other one, 'where the saying 'halfpenny's worth' comes  from?'   'Indeed,' Fabio bit on his doughnut. 'Didn't you have halfpennies at your home?'   'No,' Ciri licked her fingers.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'At my home we had golden ducats. Besides, the whole breaking thing  was stupid and pointless.'   'Why?'    'Because I wish to try one more.'   The plum filling of the doughnuts worked magic. Ciri was in high spirit and the bustling square  ceased to terrify and began fascinating her instead. She no longer followed Fabio, now she was the  one who drugged the other in the biggest crowd, to a place where someone spoke to the mob from a  makeshift platform supported on barrels. The speaker was a fat, old man.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'You're a fool, shoemaker. If not for kind ladies of Aretuza, you would've gone out of business long  ago! Their money pays for your stew!'   Fabio pulled Ciri's sleeve and they dove back into the crowd which was moving to the centre of the  square. They could hear the rumbling of the drums and loud calls for silence. The mob wasn't willing  to obey but the town crier didn't seem bothered by it.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"Blush cutely  and nothing more, yes? The priest clearly never dealt with Yennefer's ward. 'Keep your paws to yourself, baldie!' Ciri hissed with fury. 'Grab your own ass, you... you  whitewashed grave!!!'   Taking advantage of the fact that priest couldn't move while trapped in the crowd, she tried to kick  him, but Fabio prevented her, quickly drawing her away from the clergyman.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"The crowd around the scaffold cheered loudly and clapped to the rhythm. The seller of funnel cake  threw a new portion in the boiling oil. Fabio licked his fingers and pulled Ciri by the sleeve. There were plenty of stalls and many offered various snacks. They ate a creampuff each, then –  together – a smoked eel, as well as some very peculiar thing, fried and served on a stick.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
They moved ahead. Fabio spent the rest of his money on a basket of bergamot pears. Ciri looked up  at the sun but decided that it wasn't yet noon. 'Fabio? What it's in those tents and booths under the wall?'   'Various attractions.,Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"And the  incense...'   'I think it might be that sauerkraut,' said Fabio with seriousness. 'We shouldn't have eaten so much. My tummy feels weird too.'   'I'm fine!' Ciri boldly raised her head, indeed feeling much better. The realization which had struck  her now dispelled, lost from memory. 'Come, Fabio.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"Let's make haste.'   'That will be six fivers,' the pockmarked individual peered at the coins dropped on his hand. 'Three  fivers each. Lower price only for women with kids.'   'He,' Ciri pointed her pear at Fabio, 'is a kid. And I am a woman.'   'Lower price only for women with kids in their arms.' Growled the man. 'Add two more fivers,  witty lass, or make way for others.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'And be happy that abominations like  this one don't live in our vicinity! This is a monstrous basilisk from Zerrikania! Don't come any  closer, because even locked in a cage, it can still kill you with its breath!'   Ciri and Fabio made their way to the front. 'The basilisk,' the men on the podium went on, 'is the most venomous creature in the world! For  the basilisk is the king of all reptiles!",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'It will kill the rider and it will kill the horse!'   'As if!'   'Quiet, girl!' scolded the merchantress with the dog. 'Don't interrupt! We want to hear more!'    'Let it go, Ciri.'

"Come  and let its breath sweep over you! Do it and everyone will see you drop dead! Come on!'   'Gladly.' Ciri wrestled her arm from Fabio's grip and took a step forward. 'I won't allow it!' cried the fair-haired squire, leaving behind his apricot companion and standing in  Ciri's way. 'I won't let you endanger yourself, my lady!'   Ciri flushed at the title, gazed at the squire and fluttered her eyelashes at him in the way she had  practiced on Jarre the scribe.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"That whole poisonous  breath is a bluff.'   'Nevertheless,' the youth lay his arm on the hilt of his sword, 'I wish to be by your side. For your  safety and protection... will you let me?'   'I will.' Ciri couldn't figure out why the expression of anger on apricot-lady's face filled her with  so much delight. 'I'm the one who's caring for her safety!' Fabio threw the squire a challenging glare. 'And I will go  with her too!'   'My good men,' Ciri was swelling with pride, 'Show some dignity.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"There's enough  room for you both.'   The surrounding crowd babbled when she approached the cage, almost feeling the breaths of both  boys on the back of her head. The wyvern hissed furiously and tussled, its reptilian stench attacking  their nostrils. Fabio grunted loudly but Ciri didn't back off. She came even closer and reached to the  cage, almost touching it. The monster threw itself on the bars, scratching them with its fangs.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"'The cage is breaking!'    Screaming spectators ran to the exit. Some were trying to make way under the sheets but they only  got themselves and others entangled in it. The squire caught Ciri's arm at the exact same moment she  tried to leap away; as a result they both lost foothold and fell down, taking Fabio with them. The  merchantress' fluffy dog was yipping, the pockmarked man was cursing and the apricot lady gave a  piercing shriek.

The pockmarked man jumped  down from the podium and tried to keep it back with a stick but the monster disarmed him with one  blow and whipped its spiky tail at him, making a bloody mess of his pockmarked cheek. Hissing and  unfurling its maimed wings, the wyvern flew down from the podium and pounced at Ciri, Fabio and  the squire, who were trying to pick themselves up from the ground. The apricot lady fell unconscious. Ciri considered leaping away but realized that she wouldn't make it in time.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio
"Something had given  her a mighty blow in the ass. She looked around disoriented and realized that said something was, in  fact, the ground.

"Capture her! It's  not the monster-catchers fault, but hers!'   The guards, helped by many volunteers, began combing the crowd. Ciri managed to get over her  dizziness. 'Fabio,' she whispered, 'We need to split up. We'll meet in the same alley we arrived here from.",Times of Contempt,Ciri,Fabio

'It's about Ciri,' Francesca said after a moment's thought, staring at Yennefer with impenetrable eyes. 'The Lodge is interested in her. And nobody knows the girl as well as you.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"She can only be saved with our solidarity actions. When you hear what is said in Montecalvo, you'll see that I'm telling the truth... Yennefer, I do not like the glow I see in your eyes. Give me your word that you will not try to flee.' 'No.' Yennefer shook her head, covering her obsidian star with her hand. 'I can not do that, Francesca.' 'I would sincerely warn you, my dear, that all stationary target portals are blocked.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"Welcome, Francesca,' Philippa said. Her voice betrayed no emotions, but her eyes immediately narrow with caution. 'Welcome, Yennefer.' 'I had the privilege of filling two seats,' the melodiously golden-haired elf named Francesca said, clearly noting Philippa's astonishment. 'Here are my candidates. You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg. And Lady Ida Emean aep Sivney, Aen Saevherne of the Blue Mountains.' Ida Emean bowed her head with her red hair slightly, her flowing dress rustled. 'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes. 'And Scoia'tael hidden in the basement.' Keira Metz muttered. Triss froze her with a glare.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"And when all eyes are turned to you, Nilfgaardians, there will be no other way, you will have to talk. And then clarify some issues, then I too can find out more. How Yennefer disappeared from Thanedd, why she has suddenly appeared her in Montecalvo, along with Francesca. And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"But nobody wanted to count the years. Pamphlets and nonsense documents had been written and published in secret, even at the Academy in Oxenfurt. But I'll go back to the tests that Goidemar asked us...' 'Us?' Yennefer raised her head. 'Who is us?' 'Tissaia de Vries, Augusta Wagner, Leticia Charonneau and Hen Gedymdeith,' Francesca said calmly. 'Additionally, I joined this group.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"Adalia was the first daughter of the Rogue, the following children almost certainly had no trace of the activator. The latent gene in Fiona was probably in her male descendants up to the third generation. But it has not disappeared and I know why.' 'Bloody hell.' Yennefer hissed through her teeth. 'I'm lost,' said Sabrina Glevissig, 'in the jungle of all this genetic genealogy.' Francesca drew a platter of fruit closer to her, stretched out her hand and muttered a spell. 'I apologize for this fairground show of telekinesis,' she smiled, and ordered a red apple to rise from the table.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"Mistake, Enid, mistake, mistake! Too much spontaneity, too many accidents. Too little control, too little interference with chance.' 'We were not,' Enid an Gleanna, pursed her lips, 'dealing with rabbits, which can be locked in a cage and their parks chosen for them.' Fringilla, following the gaze of Triss Merigold, saw Yennefer's hands clench suddenly the carved arms of her chair. *** This is what now unites Yennefer and Francesca, Triss thought feverishly, still avoiding eye contact. The calculation.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"He tricked Emhyr and us!' Yennefer took calming breaths. Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes. Damn, thought Yennefer, with effort keeping an indifferent expression on her face. What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes...",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"Triss Merigold, who approached her was accompanied by Francesca. The elf monitored the conversation without embarrassment. But Yennefer saw the anxiety in Triss's eyes and she was sure had the conversation had no witnesses it would have been full of useless pleas for help. Triss no doubt had committed her whole soul to the Lodge already. And no doubt sense that Yennefer's loyalty was still uncertain.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"'Now let us finish this banal conversation,' she said. 'The Lodge requires loyalty. Friendship, fortunately, is not mandatory.' *** 'She has teleported,' Francesca Findabair said coldly without emotion, once the turmoil caused by the disappearance of Yennefer had calmed down. 'There is no reason to break your heads, ladies. We can not do anything now.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Francesca
"And now ... And now I will say goodbye! Sabrina Glevissig yelled, pointing at Francesca with her hand covered in rings. You went too far, Philippa! I'm not going to sit at the same table as the damn elf, even as an illusion!",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"Not so loud. Philippa hissed. Dear Francesca, dear Assire. Our initiative should be absolutely apolitical, that is its basic premise. We will not be guided by the interests of races, kingdoms, kings and emperors, but the good magic and its future.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"Triss moved uneasily, Philippa let out a barely audible sigh. Keira looked down, Sheala pretended to adjust her boa. Francesca bit her lip. Assire var Anahid's face did not flinch, but was covered with a slight blush. I just wanted to say...",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"Does participation in it mean the immediate resignation of the active and political, after all, service that we act in now with our kings? Or will we remain in this service and serve two masters at once: magic and power? When someone tells me that he is apolitical, Francesca smiled,  I always ask which of the policies he is referring to. And you know for certain he does not mean the one that he follows. said Assire var Anahid, looking at Philippa.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower. How typical it is for humans, Enid. To expect that we would immediately, on command, explain the mysteries and secrets that we ourselves have tried to unravel for centuries.' Francesca raised her hand and examined her rings.

Ida Emean looked keenly at the Queen.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"Get to the point, Enid. Explain to Lady Yennefer what is going on.' 'I'm all ears.' Yennefer touched the obsidian star on its velvet ribbon. 'Speak, Francesca.' The Daisy of the Valley placed her chin on her interlaced fingers. 'Today,' she said, 'is the second night, since the full moon. In a short while we will teleport to castle Montecalvo, home of Philippa Eilhart.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Philippa
"Yennefer, I do not like the glow I see in your eyes. Give me your word that you will not try to flee.' 'No.' Yennefer shook her head, covering her obsidian star with her hand.

"Triss froze her with a glare. Philippa made the introductions. Fringilla stared curiously at Francesca Findabair, Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, the famous Queen of Dol Blathanna, ruler of the elves who had recently regained their country.

"If the carrier is male, the gene is lost after the second or third generation.' 'But then activates again.' Philippa Eilhart said. 'Adalia, who was lacking the gene, was at the end of the day the mother of Calanthe and Calanthe was the grandmother of Ciri who is a carrier of the Lara gene.' 'The first since Riannon.' Sile de Tansarville spoke suddenly. 'You made a mistake, Francesca. There are two genes.

"The bow was at the same time, extremely cautious and measured – the imperial spy did not take his eyes off of the two ocelots who were laying at the feet of the lady of the elves. The cats blue eyes seemed sluggish and sleepy, but Vattier knew they were not pets, but vigilant guardians, ready to turn quickly into a bloody pulp anyone who dared approach the Queen at a distance that was not allowed under protocol. Francesca Findabair called Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, waited until the door closed behind Vattier and stroked her cats. 'Already, Ida.' she said.

As soon as I see, in what and how they are dressed.' Ida Emean's painted eyes narrowed, but she refrained from asking a question.

Things look pretty strange, however we were confident that Cahir was ordered to capture princess Ciri and deliver her to Nilfgaard.'' New paragraph.

However, they are not meaningless, and I would like to discuss them with you in private.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"Of all of the commandos there were no more than twelve left and they were mostly wounded.' 'The wind favoured us. We disembarked west of Hirundum and hid in the woods. Cahir tore at his bandages, shouting something about a crazy lady with green eyes, about Ciri the lion of Cintra, about a Geralt who had destroyed his group and about a sorcerer who flew like a bird towards the Tower of Gulls. He asked for a horse and ordered us back to the island, claiming it was the Emperor's orders, which, in this situation, I had to consider the ravings of a madman. In Aedirn, as we already knew, the war was already raging and I thought it best to put together a new squad and resume the fighting against the Dh'oine.'

"Though you are not the sorcerer who broke the Geralt's bones at Thanedd, I don't think it is safe for you to get close to his sword.

So I tell you, Cahir, the Geralt is looking for those who kidnapped Ciri and took her to Nilfgaard, he grits his teeth so much that sparks fly. And when he spits, the saliva hisses.' 'Ciri,' he repeated. 'Beautiful name.' 'You didn't know it?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way.

'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning.

"Banish these thoughts.' 'Are you not afraid?' 'I'm scared. And you?' 'I feel sick.' They were silent for a long time. 'Tell me, Cahir, when did you meet Ciri?' 'For the first time? Three years ago. During the battle of Cintra.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"This morning I let a higher vampire get away from my sword, who surely has on his conscience many human lives. I should have killed him. I am only interested in one thing: to get at the skins of those who have hurt Ciri. I vowed to myself that those who have hurt her will pay for it with their blood.' Cahir remained silent. 'Your revelation, which Milva told me about, does not change anything.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"The worst thing is, I do not understand why, despite everything I can not kill you. I do not understand what stops me.' 'It may be,' Cahir said quietly, 'that against all appearances, we have something in common, you and me? 'I wonder what' 'Like you, I want to save Ciri. Like you, I do not care if this is odd and surprises people. Like you, I have no intention of telling anyone my reasons.' 'Is that all?' 'No.' 'I'm listening.'

'No.' Cahir bowed his head and a scuffed his heel in the sand.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"The probability of finding Ciri is zero.' 'Oh yes,' Milva ridiculed 'Isn't this only a matter of initiative and positive thinking, as with the strainer. If we don't have something, then we will replace it with something else. So I thought.' 'Until recently,' the vampire continued, 'we thought Ciri was in Nilfgaard. Getting there and rescuing her or stealing her seemed an impossible task. Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses. They might not want to talk to us, let alone use magic.' 'Regis,' reminded the Geralt, 'knows someone among those of Caed Dhu.' 'And this knowledge doesn't go back three or four hundred years?' 'It is far more recent,' the vampire said with an enigmatic smile.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Cahir
"Milva leaned against the trunk of the pine, and began to remember. Just to kill time. *** Her first meeting with the Geralt occurred in July, two weeks after the events on the island Thanedd and the outbreak of war in Dol Angra. Milva returned to Brokilon after a few days absence, bringing with her the remains of a group of Scoia'tael commandos, who had been stranded in Temeria while trying to enter territory under Aedirn which was already involved in the war. The Squirrels had wanted to join the uprising of elves in Dol Blathanna.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"But Milva had already had time to hear the accounts from excited Dryads on the Eastern borders of Brokilon, about the events that had occured two weeks before. About a chestnut-haired sorceress who had appeared in Brokilon in a flash of magic with a wounded man, his arms and feet broken, clinging to her. The wounded man was the Geralt, known as Gwynbleidd, White Wolf. Initially, the dryads had not known what to do. The bleeding Geralt screamed and fainted, as Aglais applied makeshift dressings to his wounds.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And then came the order from Duen Canella, from Eithne with eyes of silver, the Lady of Brokilon. The Sorceress read the order from the ruler of the Forest Dryads. The Geralt was to be cared for here. They healed him. Milva had seen with her own eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I have another one to make. That's what I thought. The Geralt? Help him. Milva stopped, turned, and with a sharp movement snatched a twig of honeysuckle that obstructed her path.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"She had half an hour at least. She stuck between her teeth a blade of grass she had pulled from the ground and plunged back into her memories. *** When, after twelve days, she returned to Brokilon, the Geralt was already walking. He limped slightly and imperceptibly dragged his leg, but still walked. Milva was not surprised - she knew about the miraculous healing properties of the water and the forest weed, conynhael.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva was not surprised - she knew about the miraculous healing properties of the water and the forest weed, conynhael. She knew too of Aglaia's skills, more than once she had witnessed the rapid healing of wounded Dryads. And, obviously, the rumors about the robustness and the extraordinary resistance of Geralts were not fabricated. Upon her arrival, she did not go to the Col Serrai though the dryads knew Gwynbleidd eagerly awaited her return. She delayed the meeting deliberately, she was still not happy that she had been given the mission and wanted to express her displeasure.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"She delayed the meeting deliberately, she was still not happy that she had been given the mission and wanted to express her displeasure. She escorted the Squirrel commandos to the camp, and gave a lengthy account of the events that had passed, warning the dryads against the blockade on the border by the Ribbon, organised by the humans. Only when she was reminded for the third time, Milva took a bath, changed and went to the Geralt. He waited for her on the edge of a clearing, where cedars grew. He walked around from time to time, sat down, then straightened himself elastically.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"This time he urged her to continue. This Codringher, she finally asked  Whom you made me visit, he was your friend? The Geralt's face did not move, but Milva knew that he had understood. No. He was not.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Hey there! What's up? The Geralt staggered, leaning against a cedar, then sat down heavily on a tree stump. Milva jumped, frightened by the pallor that had suddenly covered his face. Aglais!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
I know. You were just asking what my command is. My command is: leave the the Geralt alone. At your command. And what about Milva?,Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Ori Reuven sprinkled the letter with sand. Dijkstra sat comfortably, with his hands clasped on his stomach, and began twiddling his thumbs. This Milva, the one who spies for the Geralt,  Dijkstra asked,  What can you tell me about her? She is, hem, hem,  grunted the Secretary  Responsible for taking the survivors of Scoia'tael groups broken by the Temerian army to Brokilon. She helps the elves to escape, allowing them to rest and re-form into their commando units ...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And now let me breathe. If you want, we can resume this conversation when I'm rested. The Geralt was silent. Milva hung out her wet socks on a forked branch, so that the rising sun would dry them out, then pulled off her belt buckle. I wish you would not stand there with that dissapproving look,  she grumbled,  What better news could you have expected?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva approached, pulling her arrow from the dead horseman. Thank you. The Geralt said. Dandelion, this is Milva Barring. Thanks to her we are still alive.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Now, that's a surprise. Who would have thought? You know him, Geralt? In answer to her question, Geralt smiled nastily in full view of the prisoner. Put the knife away, Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They were a prisoner of the people who attacked and almost killed us. The enemy of our enemies ... He paused, seeing the Geralt pull a knife from his boot. Milva cleared her throat softly. The dark blue eyes of the prisoner, narrowed from the constant dripping of rain drops, now widened.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"To me, the Imperial cohort! Woe is me, woe is me! A Geralt comes to me in a canoe, he will be here soon, he will take my life and deprive me of my crown! I'm lost! Stop it, Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Scoia'tael. Milva said, getting up. Now do you understand what is happening, Geralt? Has it come to your brain yet? Nilfgaard, Verden and the Squirrels are in cahoots.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Through these fires? Where there is such butchery? I feel,  said Geralt reluctantly,  that we have no choice. Well,  Milva said. I can take you through the forests to Owl Hill and back to the Ceann Treise, towards Brokilon.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"That is not what I meant,  grumbled Dandelion. He's not talking to you. Milva emerged suddenly from the darkness, and after a moment's hesitation she sat down next to the Geralt. That was for me. These were my words that I hurt him so much with, the words that I spoke in anger, not thinking...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They rode to the East. Milva lead. When Geralt turned her attention and said that the Yaruga was to the South, the archer insulted him and reminded him that she was the guide and she knew what she was doing. They spoke no more. In the end, it was important that they made progress, the direction was not significant.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The number of dead was impossible to determine, or even to approximate. To get rid of them hastily, not only were arrows, swords and lances used, but also lumberjack equipment they had found on site - axes, saws and long handsaws. There were other images, but Geralt, Dandelion and Milva no longer remembered them. They had expelled them from memory. They became indifferent.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They were alone among the trees in the forest. Or so they thought. Geralt first heard the whinny of a horse following them. With a stony face, he turned Roach. Dandelion opened his mouth, but Milva passed him a silent gesture, she took her bow from the quiver on her saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I ordered you to dismount. I will not dismount, I have no desire to fight. Milva,  the Geralt nodded at the archer. Do me a favour, kill the horse he's sitting on. No!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"You're going in search of the girl, I want to help you. I need to help. This is crazy,  Geralt turned to Milva and Dandelion. He's suffering from insanity. We are dealing with a madman.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"He will fit in with our company then,  Milva muttered. He will fit in perfectly. Think about his proposal, Geralt. sneered Dandelion. After all, he is a Nilfgaardian nobleman.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Draw your weapon. No. Geralt,  Milva leaned over in her saddle, and spat on the ground. Time passes, and we are soaked to the bone. The Nilfgaardian does not want to stand against you and, although you put on a fierce air, I highly doubt you will kill him in cold blood.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And you talk constantly, you don't even know it! Go, go! Milva,  the Geralt asked after a while, protecting his face from the rain as he rode at a canter. You really would have killed his horse? No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I hear ... singing. The Geralt shook his head, Milva giggled. You're having hallucinations, poet. Quiet!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Someone is singing, I'm telling you! Don't you hear it? Geralt pulled off his hood, Milva also pricked up her ears, and after a moment she looked at the Geralt and nodded silently. The troubadour was right. His musical ear had not betrayed him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Stood here in the middle of the forest, in the drizzle, with corpses scattered on the road, yet a happy song reached their ears. From the South, someone came, singing briskly and cheerfully. Milva pulled the reins of her horse ready to flee, but the Geralt gestured her to stop. He was intrigued. The singing that they heard was not menacing.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Must be that still not wed, that is why so jolly! Um-ta, um-ta, uhu-ha! Dandelion laughed suddenly, pulled out the lute from under his wet coat, and paying no attention to the hisses of Geralt and Milva, he plucked the strings and sang in a loud voice: In the grass can you see, wolf just limps along, Looking down, awful frown, crying like a dog. Why is this mighty beast so badly rampaged? Must be that, freshly wed or lately engaged!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Or, woman, my apologies good lady! Hello, I am Zoltan Chivay. I'm Geralt,  the Geralt introduced himself after a moment's hesitation. The one who sang is Dandelion. And this is Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"He knows what he's talking about,  muttered Milva. Where are you going? South,  Geralt said immediately. I would not recommend it. Zoltan Chivay shook his head again.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"As you can see, they are already before us, and to the North, they head for Brugge. Therefore, the only reasonable direction to flee is the East. Milva gave a knowing look to the Geralt, who refrained from commenting. We are just going to the East,  continued Zoltan Chivay. The only chance is to hide behind the front, and the Temerian army will be coming from the East, from the river Ina.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"It means my first impressions were right. So then, do we walk together? Geralt looked at Milva. The archer nodded. Good.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I decided therefore to take solid action, so it does not go in vain. I'm good for myself and my immediate entourage. Geralt did not ask any more questions. *** During one of their stops, Geralt and Milva chatted longer with Zoltan Chivay, the incorrigible and compulsive altruist. The dwarf was well informed about the course of the war or at least he gave that impression.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"King Foltest's troops have probably already recovered from the surprise and will show the Nilfgaardians some resistance. I hope so. Milva said, looking at the Geralt. The problem is, we have urgent matters in the South. We had thought of going South from Turlough, towards the Yaruga.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"You cannot piss any higher, that's my advice. Milva's facial expression revealed that she agreed with the dwarf. Geralt had nothing to say. He felt very bad. He felt a dull ache like invisible blunt teeth biting into the bones of his left forearm and right knee, the pain made worse by his fatigue and the constant humidity.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva came out of nowhere, pulling an arrow from her quiver and pointing it in the direction the cry had come from. But it wasn't necessary. Geralt had heard it, seen it and he knew what it was. The child that had screamed, was a freckled girl with pigtails, maybe eight or nine years old. She was rooted to the spot a few steps in front of a pile of rotting tree trunks.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva said from behind his back. And I understand. You don't need anybody, Geralt. You often show it. I am not conducting a personal war,  he turned sharply.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Yazon Yarda spread his hands, and shouted something back. The girl began to scream. Geralt and the others heard it, but they were not able to distinguish the words. Those words must have had an impression on Yazon and Caleb, because the two dwarves turned on their heels and ran back towards the lilac bushes. Milva stretched her bow again, moving the tip, looking for a target.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Take my sihill. With it, once is enough. The Geralt accepted the dwarf's weapon without hesitation and without a word. Again he pointed out to Milva, the straggler guarding the horses. Then he jumped over the stumps and walked briskly towards the sheds.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The last clung to his horse's neck, cleared the ditch full of corpses and galloped down towards the road. Milva! The Geralt and dwarf cried simultaneously. The archer was already running towards him. She stopped, frozen with her legs apart.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Because after all, even if the rogue had caught smallpox, the damn disease doesn't spread that fast! It wasn't my arrow. Milva gave the Geralt a knowing look. It wasn't smallpox either. But I think I know what it was.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"well, its not my business. Especially since we benefit from such a rear guard. Milva said, looking meaningfully at Geralt. Are you certain that this Cahir is your enemy? The Geralt did not answer.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They did not know how to defend themselves. The girl with braids rose onto all fours, then stood on her feet, and with shaking hands tried unsuccessfully to improve the remnants of her torn garments. The Geralt was surprised, seeing that in general, she was in absolutely no way similar to Ciri, when only a moment before he swore she looked like her twin sister. With an uncoordinated movement the girl rubbed her face, and moved unsteadily towards the cottage, not avoiding the puddle of manure. Hey, wait,  called Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Its green saddle had the embroidery of Nilfgaard and was covered in dark blood stains. It was impossible to know whether it was the blood of the slain rider or whether it was shed later when the horse had a new owner. 'Well the problem is ended.' Milva said, looking at Geralt. 'If there was a problem.' 'The real problem is that we do not know who the rider was, who was thrown from the saddle.' Zoltan murmured. 'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth. 'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And hanging from an oak, too.' Zoltan waved his hand and walked to the tree. Dandelion who could not resist his curiosity, spurred on Pegasus, and went after the dwarf. Geralt, after a moment's reflection, followed them. Milva trailed after him. The crows that were feeding on the corpses reluctantly rose into the air, squawking and rustling their feathers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And do not forget where you hid everything!' 'Rest assured.' 'Catch up to us when you can.' Zoltan tucked his hatchet into his belt and threw his backpack over his shoulder along with Sihil. 'We are crossing over O, then along the Chotla to Ina. Farewell.' 'Interesting.' Milva muttered to Geralt, when their weakened squad departed on the road, waving farewell to the four dwarves left behind. 'I wonder what was in those boxes, that they needed to bury them and mark the place. And so that none of us saw.' 'It's not our business.' 'I don't think,' Dandelion said softly while carefully guiding Pegasus among the fallen trunks, 'that the boxes contained clean underwear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They turned back in silence. The women from Kernow walked with difficulty, stumbling and supporting the children, but none make a word of complaint. Milva rode alongside the Geralt, the little girl with the braids asleep in her arms. 'If I understand,' she said, 'something in those woods three years ago, almost ended your life. You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt. He decided that when the next time they camped he would box Dandelion's ears for his uncontrollable tongue. Knowing the poet, it would have no effect; especially considering Dandelion sung everything he knew.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I certainly do not believe in these cheap prophecies, but two days ago I dreamed I hanged. I woke up completely covered in sweat, I couldn't swallow or catch my breath. So do not be surprised now that I don't like listening to talk of the gallows.' 'I was not talking to you, but to the Geralt.' Milva said. 'And close your ears, so you don't trap any bugs. Well, Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'That the hanged man on the oak was eaten by ghouls. And we are in a cemetery now, where there are ghouls.' 'Not always.' 'I'll hold you to your word. You're a Geralt, a specialist, you'll defend us from them, I hope. Do these ghouls fight better than marauders?' 'You can't compare them. I asked you not to panic.' 'Will this be enough for a vampire?' Milva turned the silver tip, running her thumb along it to make sure it was sharp.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I can not recommend any medication for soothing the pain. Especially narcotics. You're a Geralt; it would be unacceptable for your body.' 'So the best thing is your mandrake.' The Geralt raised the glass that Milva had filled and given to him, and drank to the bottom, then coughed until tears came to his eyes. 'Damn, I feel better.' 'I'm not sure,' Regis said with a tight-lipped smile, 'you are treating the disease properly. I remember you should cure the causes not the symptoms.' 'Not for this Geralt.' A ruddy faced Dandelion snorted.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The surgeons hut in the moonlight looked fabulous. Exactly like the witch's hut in the forest. Geralt buttoned his pants. Milva, who had left the house shortly after, cleared her throat uncertainly. Her shadow cast a shadow next to the one cast by Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I want to drink more.' 'Milva?' 'What?' 'You never told me why you decided to come with me.' 'You never asked.' 'I'm asking now.' 'It is too late. Now I don't even know.' *** 'Well finally, you're back.' Zoltan greeted them cheerfully. 'Now we are all here, imagine this, Regis has decided to journey with us.' 'Really?' Geralt looked at the alchemist. 'Why the sudden decision?' 'Zoltan,' Regis lowered his eyes, 'made me realize that the war that sweeps around me is much more serious than the stories I have heard from the refugees. Returning to Dillingen is off the table and hiding in the wilderness doesn't seem wise.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva frowned. Zoltan, forgetting that he already told everyone about the old fart, Hogg the Mahakam thane, started again. Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened. Regis also listened and even added comments, completely calm about being the only sober one among those present. Dandelion strummed his lute and sang.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"It should have helped him maintain balance, but instead proved to be highly unstable. 'But it as I said, a secret. A secret goal!' 'Indeed, artfully concealed,' nodded the surgeon, glancing at the pale with anger, Geralt. 'Analyzing the direction of your journey, even the most suspicious person could never guess the purpose of your trip.' *** 'Milva, what is it?' 'Do not talk to me, you drunken fool.' 'Hey, she's crying! Hey, look...' 'Go to hell, I say!' The archer wiped her tears.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'I just saw the Countess de Lettenhove...' 'Who?' 'Whatever. Damn, this moonshine really loosens the tongue... Geralt, can I pour you another? Geralt!' 'Leave him alone.' Milva said. 'Let him dream.' *** Standing on the edge of the village the barn rumbled with music, the music caught up to them before they had even rode up, filled with excitement.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Give us the black horse, we need it.' Milva wiped her sweaty neck and clenched her teeth. The look in her tired eyes became that of a wolf. 'Where are you going, fellows?' The Geralt smiled, trying to alleviate the escalating situation. 'Why do you need the horse, which you ask for so politely?' 'And how can we otherwise find the tomb of the vampire? Everyone knows that if you ride around the cemetery on the back of a black horse, when it stops in front of a grave and refused to move, that is where the vampire is.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"He can remember his name and what happened. This is a good sign. The lively emotions of Lady Milva did not, fortunately, have consequences.' The Geralt looked at the archer, who was sitting next to them on rock, her eyes lost in the distance. 'She isn't a delicate lady susceptible to such emotions,' he muttered. 'I would blame the residue of the belladonna from yesterday.' 'She has vomited before.' Zoltan interjected quietly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Everyone was still asleep. I think it was because of the mushrooms we got in Turlough. I have also had a sore gut for two days ' Regis gave the Geralt a strange look from under his greying eyebrows, smiled mysteriously and wrapped himself in his black cloak. Geralt went to Milva and cleared his throat. 'How do you feel?' 'Miserable.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Holy men often dream of vagina dentata.' 'I bet its worse,' Dandelion replied, also in a whisper. 'He probably daydreams all the time about a normal one, without teeth. And the desire has risen to his brain.' 'And that deranged girl will pay for it.' 'Can we not find anyone,' growled Milva, 'who will stop this black fool?' Dandelion looked meaningfully and with hope towards the Geralt but Geralt avoided his gaze. 'And who else but this female witch is to blame for our current troubles and misery?' The priest continued to shout. 'Why, it was none other than the witches of Thanedd Island who betrayed our kings, assassinating the King of Redania!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"A challenge to a duel? Anyone can clearly see you are a scoundrel and a bully! With your sword, you want to pass the judgement of God?' 'If you do not like the sword,' said Zoltan, coming to stand next to Geralt, 'and if this fellow does not fit you, maybe I will be worthy? Come on let those who accuse the girl beat me with the axe.' 'Or me with the bow.' said Milva, squinting, also emerging from the crowd. 'One arrow at a hundred paces.' 'You see, people, how quickly they multiply to defend the witch?' shouted the priest, then turned and twisted his face into a sly smile.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"But if the judgement of God shows something else, then you die with her! I have spoken!' The murmurs of displeasure from Mayor Laabs and his group were drowned out by the shouts of those gathered by the priest, anticipating a great show and rejoicing. Milva looked at Zoltan, Zoltan the Geralt, the Geralt at the sky, and then at Milva. 'Do you believe in gods?' He asked in a low voice. 'I believe,' said the archer quietly, staring intently at the embers in the fire.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'Please refrain from praying.' The surgeon approached the fire, respectfully bowed to the priest and to the audience and then without the slightest hesitation, reached his hand into the burning coals. The crowd gasped in unison, Zoltan cursed. Milva grasped Geralt's arm. Regis straightened up, looked calmly at the horseshoe in his hand and without hurrying, approached the priest. The priest stepped back, but crashed into the peasants who were behind him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"All a deafening roar and din. 'Our horses!' Milva yelled, sending kicks and punches around her. 'Our horses, Geralt! To me, quickly!' 'Geralt!' Dandelion screamed. 'Help!' The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'Help!' The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it. Geralt grabbed Dandelion by the collar but was not carried away because he managed to latch onto the wagon, which the girl accused of witchcraft was tied to. The wagon jerked suddenly and moved from its place, the Geralt and the poet crashed to the ground. The girl shook her head and stared laughing hysterically. The wagon slowly drifted away, the laughter was lost among the general roar.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him. He did not have time to reflect on this unusual phenomenon as one of the soldiers hit him with a spear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Familiar with the horse, she was able to force the gelding to a gallop. Or rather a sluggish run, which Pegasus considered a gallop. But even this pseudo-gallop was enough to catch the horse thieves, since their escape was slowed by a more unusual horse: Roach, the Geralt's bay mare, which Geralt had promised more than once to replace with a donkey, mule or even a goat. Milva overtook the thieves when the unskilful rider pulling on Roach's reins fell to the ground and the rest of the peasants jumped from their saddles, trying to tame the frisky, kicking mare. They were so busy that they did not noticed when Milva came up on Pegasus and kicked one in the face, breaking his nose.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'So take your horse, spy and get out of my woods.' *** 'You endured the torment in that coffin they carried you in,' Milva murmured. 'I don't understand. Why didn't you go to a town and hide, why follow after the Geralt? He hates you... The two times he saved your life...' 'Three times.' 'Twice I was there.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'Milva... Maria Barring. But they call me, Milva.' 'The Geralt is moving in the wrong direction, Milva,' he said after a moment. 'Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. It was not Nilfgaard who kidnapped her.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"You are not alone, I can see.' 'You see well,' Milva let go of Cahir's arm, who had already reached for his sword. 'I am not alone but the same cannot be said about yourself. Regis, where is the Geralt? Dandelion? And the rest?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The guards standing next to the shed chatted idly, laughing and occasionally cleared their throats and spat for long periods. The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Second, because we lie bound in a shed which is located in the center of a camp of an army of several thousand people.' 'And the third reason? You mentioned three.' 'Third,' he replied wearily, 'the limit of miracles for this month has already been exhausted when the women of Kernow found their missing husbands.' *** 'There,' the surgeon said, pointing out the glowing dots of campfires. 'There is the fort of America, the current troop camp for the Temerian army concentrated in Mayena.' 'The Geralt and Dandelion are imprisoned there?' Milva stood in her stirrups. 'Ha, it is so dark... There will be crowds of armed people around and guards.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"You go with the horses towards the brightest star of the Seven Goats. Wait at the river where the Chotla empties into the Ina. When I manage to free the Geralt, we'll head in that direction. There we will meet.' 'He is highly arrogant,' Cahir whispered to Milva after dismounting from their horses found them close to each other. 'Alone, without any help he is going into trouble, did you hear?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'as that Nilfgaardian name was pronounced with almost no accent.' 'I'm not...' 'Enough!' Milva cut him off. 'There is no time to argue and dawdle. Regis, the Geralt is waiting for a rescue.' 'Not before midnight,' the surgeon said coldly, looking at the moon. 'So we have time to talk. Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva is waiting there with horses.' 'Help me get up...' He stood up on one leg, then the second, biting his fist. Dandelion's circulation had had time to return to normal. The Geralt, after a moment, was also ready. 'How do we get out?' the poet suddenly asked. 'The guards at the door are snoring, but they...' 'They won't' interrupted Regis in a whisper.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"*** 'Dawn will be here soon,' Milva said not looking at the sky but at the glossy surface of the river. 'The catfish chase the salmon. But there is no sign of the Geralt or Dandelion. Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion. 'Pah...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Just a little blood. Just a little blood... Your blood smells good, poet.' Just then the Geralt behaved in a way that Milva did not expect. He went to the hose and pulled from a sheath under the saddle a long sword. 'Get away from him,' he snapped, standing next to the surgeon.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The liver destroyed, the kidneys and intestines cut up, faeces spilling out, infection of the peritoneum... Well, you're done. Geralt, I'm at your disposal.' He stood up and the Geralt placed his sword on his neck. With a movement that was too fast for the eye to follow. 'Step back,' Geralt growled at Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The archer gasped when she saw how the surgeon's eyes gleamed in the darkness, with a cat's light. 'Well, go on,' Regis said calmly. 'Push.' 'Geralt,' Dandelion moaned from the floor, fully conscious, 'Are you crazy? He saved us from the gallows... He healed my head...' 'He saved us and that girl in the camp.' Milva gently reminded him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"How much exactly?' 'Fuck off, Regis.' 'Of course. But before that, my valuation, please.' 'An ordinary vampire I would look at the equivalent of a good horse and saddle. But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Same to you.' Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy snapped his cloak, wrapped it around himself and disappeared. Simply disappeared. 'Now,' Geralt turned naked sword still in his hand, 'it's your turn, Nilfgaardian...' 'No,' Milva interrupted angrily. 'I've had enough. Get the horses, and let's get out of here!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The day broke with a red sun, which shone blindingly off of the water lily covered lakes; they turned towards the spot where one of the many branches of the Ina flowed into the Yaruga. The now rode through the dark gloomy forests, where the trees grew directly from the duckweed from the green marshes. Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva was the first to see the boat among the reeds which must have been brought there by the current. She spotted a clearing among the willows, suitable for a pasture for the horses. They stopped and the Geralt decided it was about time to talk to the Nilfgaardian. In private. *** 'I gave you your life at Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They made a trap out of wicker found in the boat and waded around the shore with sticks beating the seaweed, trying to propel the fish into the trap. The poet was feeling better already and walked with his head bandaged heroically, proud as a peacock. The Geralt was thoughtful and angry. Dandelion and Milva pulled the wicker trap from the water and started to curse, because instead of carp, they had caught little fish among the weeds. The Geralt stood.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"What is it?' 'Nothing.' Milva brushed her hair from her shoulders. 'Nothing. Speak, Geralt. I want to know what else you have to say.' 'I have nothing else to say. I'm going south, to the other side of the Yaruga.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"So I'm going alone.' 'Having disposed of cumbersome baggage,' Dandelion nodded.' The ball and chain hindering your march. In other words, me.' 'And me,' Milva added, looking away. 'Listen,' said Geralt, much calmer now. 'This is a personal matter. It does not concern you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Alone.' 'I'm going,' Milva rose resiliently. 'Do you think that would ask you? To the devil with you, Geralt. Come on, Dandelion, let's go find some food. I'm hungry and listening to this drivel has made me feel sick.' Geralt turned his head.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'You can expertly clean these fish. I'll go a fetch some water.' 'Can you carry a full cauldron? Geralt, help her.' 'I can handle it,' Milva growled irritably. 'I can do without his help. He deals with personal issues, I wouldn't dare disturb him!' Geralt turned his head, pretending not to hear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I didn't know.' 'Ignorance,' Regis smiled. 'Is not an excuse for thoughtless actions. When one doesn't know or is in doubt, it is good to seek advice...' 'Shut up, Vampire!' Geralt stood up and turned his back. Dandelion snorted. 'Look at him, you've offended him again.' 'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'I say,' gasped Milva. 'That it was a silly thing to have soup, Dandelion.' 'Certainly,' Regis agreed. 'What do you say, Geralt?' 'I say – thank you.' The Geralt stood up with effort, rubbed his knee, which began to bite back with pain. 'Is that enough? Or do you need a fanfare?' 'It is always like that with him,' the troubadour waved his hand.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is. It is difficult to speak of initiative when you have no idea what direction to go.' 'What shall we do then?' Milva pouted. 'The Geralt insists we move south...' 'For him,' Regis smiled, 'the cardinal points have no meaning. He does not care which way we move, so long as he is not sitting doing nothing. This is the purpose of a Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"In other words, movement is everything, the goal is nothing.' 'That's silly,' said Milva. 'His goal is Ciri. Is she not important to him?' 'I joke,' admitted the vampire, watching Geralt with his back still turned. 'Without much tact. Sorry.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head. 'Comrades in arms! A team of heroes!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"A foul-mouthed female half wild, half dryad. A four hundred year old vampire. And a fucking Nilfgaardian who insists that he is not Nilfgaardian.' 'And leading them is a Geralt, sick with remorse, helplessness and an inability to make decisions.' Regis finished calmly. 'Indeed, I propose that we travel incognito, to avoid arousing sensation.' 'And laughter.' Milva added. The queen said: 'Don't plead for mercy, but beg those whom you harmed with your sorcery.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'Or I'll grab a stick and tan you all, bastards! I said in order. Grandfather Pogwizd will tell us about the Geralt and how he wandered with Dandelion, Milva...' 'Yes!' Nimue squeaked again. 'About Milva. I want to hear about Milva!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The sun was setting. Cranes ascended from the wetlands, screeching and flying in a wedge. Everything is fucked up, thought the Geralt, looking at the ruins of a woodcutter's hut and the little bit of smoke rising from a fire that Milva made. Everything has gone to hell. And everything was going so well, even with this strange company.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"But they did not. And the reason why was proved at one of the first camps. *** 'Wait a moment, Geralt,' the poet began, looking around. 'Don't be in such a rush to get back to camp. We want to talk to you in private, here, me and Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'No. In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva heated water in a pot hung over the fire and used the steam to straighten the fletching on her arrows that were wrinkled. Cahir was repairing a broken boot buckle. Geralt was carving a stick. And Regis ran his eyes over each of them in order. 'Well, well,' He said finally.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt. 'He doesn't. You do not need to confide or to explain.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"But when the wind stirs the fear, the crow will react by fleeing.' 'The behaviour of the crow explains the struggle for life.' Cahir pointed out from the darkness. 'The crow is smart,' Milva snorted. 'It is not afraid of a straw man, but real men, because men throw stones and shoot arrows.' 'Self-preservation,' said Geralt, 'is inherent in all living things, crows and people. Thank you for the explanation, Regis, we accept them completely. But don't go digging into the depths of the human subconscious.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Who is on the offensive, and who is in retreat. Let the plague take it all! I don't remember if I told you this already, but I say that war is always reminiscent of a brothel on fire...' 'You've told us,' interrupted Geralt, 'a few hundred times.' 'Why are they fighting here?' the Poet spat. 'Over the junipers and strawberries? Because this country does not have anything else!' 'Among the dead lying in the bushes,' said Milva, 'were elves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Someone is trying to block the trails, I think.' 'It is not impossible,' Regis admitted, 'that the Temerian army is hunting for Squirrels here. But I think there are too many soldiers around here. I suspect that the Nilfgaardians have finally crossed the Yaruga.' 'That's what I suspect,' the Geralt grimaced slightly, looking at Cahir's stony face. 'The corpses we saw this morning, showed signs of the Nilfgaardian method of warfare.' 'Some others are no better.' Milva growled, coming to the young Nilfgaardians defence. 'And do not look askance at Cahir, for both of you share the same fate.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Milva indeed prepared her bow, but jumped from the saddle. So she was not hunting. Geralt approached with caution. 'Smoke,' she said tersely. 'I don't see it.' 'Use your nose.' The Archer's sense of smell was not mistaken, but the smell of smoke was barely noticeable.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'I don't see it.' 'Use your nose.' The Archer's sense of smell was not mistaken, but the smell of smoke was barely noticeable. It could not be smoke from a fire or conflagration. This smoke, Geralt thought, smells nice. It came from a fire, which was baking something. 'Will we avoid it?' Milva asked softly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Be alert.' In a thicket on the edge of the forest a stretched a view of a hill with logs placed in piles around it. A fine ribbon of smoke rose from the logs. Geralt calmed down a bit – in sight nothing moved and between the logs was not enough space to be able to hide a large group. Milva noticed it to. 'There are no horses,' she whispered.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'The Geralt has found us! Or is he a mirage? Percival, do you see what I'm seeing?' Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him. And when the rest of the company emerged from behind the piles of logs, the shouts of delight intensified accordingly. 'Milva!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"A thief and a bandit?' 'Without hesitation. Because I am no longer as easily fooled as I used to be. While I don't question motives, I am slowly learning the art of looking beneath the masks.' *** Geralt waved Sihil across the path of a passing moth. After parting with Zoltan and his group, the Geralt recalled, we found a group of peasants wandering in the woods. Some fled at the sight of us, but Milva stopped a few, threatening them with her bow.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"As primitive tribes, adhering to shamanic taboo? It is obvious that only a woman could make such a decision, it is their inherent right! If Milva decides to...' 'Shut up, Dandelion,' the Geralt growled. 'Be so kind as to shut up.' 'Do you believe otherwise?' the poet raised his voice. 'Would you forbid...' 'Shut up, damn it, because I will not vouch for myself!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Now go, please. Leave me alone. Go away, Geralt. Go away, before you shatter my world completely.' *** When they left at dawn, Milva was at the head of the company, calm and smiling. And riding behind her was Dandelion who began to strum his lute, while whistling a tune.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"She must of course take care of herself, but she is completely healthy and functional. I would say even more capable. The hormones...' 'Drop the mentoring tone,' Geralt interrupted. 'Because it is starting to get on my nerves.' 'That was the first thing,' reminded Regis, 'the second is that if Milva realises you are being overprotective, treating her like a plaything and sheltering her like an egg, she is simply going to get mad. And then she will get stressed, which is absolutely inappropriate for her.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river. The soldiers on the bank again raised a roar, and laid their hands on their bows, arrows began to whistle through the air and one of the horses whinnied wildly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"It seemed like they would succeed, when suddenly Milva let go of her spar and without a word pointed at the right bank. 'This time...' Cahir said, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'This time, it is Nilfgaard.' Geralt also saw it. The riders, who had appeared on the right bank, wore black and green cloaks, the horses wore distinctive harnesses. There were at least a hundred.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"When after a few moments of straining with the spar, Geralt looked up and saw pine boughs over his head. An arrow shot from the top of the cliffs, struck on the deck of the barge only two feet away from him. Another was heading straight for Cahir, which the Geralt deflected with a slash of his sword. Milva, Cahir, the ferryman and his assistant, no longer pushed from the bottom, but from the shore and the slope. Geralt threw down his sword and sized a spar to help them, and the ferry began to drift back towards the center of the river.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"The bolt went through him from side to side. Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle. However, the actual slaughter the hail of bolts cause was among the horses.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"Everyone jumped onto the island or into the water, escaping the hooves of the horses kicking in agony. Milva was the last, for her movement suddenly became frighteningly slow. She was hit with a bolt, thought the Geralt seeing the girl drag herself overboard with effort, and then fall limp onto the sand. He jumped towards her, but the vampire was faster. 'Something has torn in me,' she said very slowly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'I want him to stay with me...' A tear run down her cheek. Above them the bridge resonated with the boots of soldiers. 'Geralt!' Dandelion cried. The Geralt, seeing what the vampire was doing to Milva, turned his head in embarrassment. He saw soldiers in white jackets rushing along the bridge.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'We will need to carry her,' he said. 'It is our only chance...' 'Not our only,' Cahir said. 'Geralt, to the bridge.' 'Why?' 'Let's halt the flight. If the Nordlings can hold the right side of the bridge, we can get Milva to the left bank.' 'How do we stop them fleeing?' 'I have led soldiers before. Climb the pillar onto the bridge!' Once on the bridge Cahir showed that he indeed had experience in controlling panic among the troops.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"They are still fighting! Shame on him who does not go to their aid! Follow me!' 'Dandelion,' the Geralt hissed. 'Go back to the island. You have to help Regis get Milva to the left bank.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"'You want me to kill... My countrymen? I can't...' 'I shit on this war,' The Geralt clenched his teeth. 'This is for Milva. You joined the company.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"And so it was that those who had recently been deserting in panic, rushed over the Nilfgaardians like ravenous wolves, cutting with swords, axes, stabbing with spears and bludgeoning with clubs and halberds. The railings on both sides of the bridge cracked, the horses flew into the river along with their riders on their black cloaks. The uproarious army pushed onto the opposite shore, howling and pushing Geralt and Cahir, the accidental commanders, not letting them do what they wanted to do. Which was to withdraw stealthily, back to Milva and move her to the left bank. The battle raged on.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Milva
"We are writing to Philippa, not to the royal council, the letter has to look aesthetically pleasing! New paragraph. I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well. The problem would solve itself, I am sure that treacherous black-haired beauty would not anticipate the day nor the hour. The Geralt does not like it when someone touches his little girl, Artaud Terranova conclusively found that out on Thanedd. I would like to believe, Phil, that you do not withhold evidence of Yennefer's treason and do not know where she is hiding. I would be very sorry if it turned out, that there is another secret kept from me.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt. He decided that when the next time they camped he would box Dandelion's ears for his uncontrollable tongue. Knowing the poet, it would have no effect; especially considering Dandelion sung everything he knew.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"The sound that caught his ear was not the opening of a creaking door, but the sound of snoring. The guards had fallen asleep on duty. He exhaled and cursed without a sound and was ready to immerse himself in thoughts of Yennefer when the Geralt medallion around his neck quivered suddenly and a powerful smell struck his nostrils of wormwood, basil, coriander, save and anise. And God knows what else. 'Regis?' he whispered in disbelief, unsuccessfully trying to raise his head from the floor.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"Since they were asking about Yennefer of Vengerberg and not a figurine.' 'What has changed, that you finally decided to decompress me?' 'A lot. I'll explain.' 'Before you do, I want to know something else. Geralt was at Thanedd. The Geralt. Remember I presented him to you in Aretuza.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"What happened to him?' 'Calm down. He lives.' 'I am calm. Tell me, Enid.' 'Your Geralt,' said Francesca, 'during only one hour did more than many do throughout their whole lives. In short: He broke Dijkstra's leg, cut off the head of Artuad Terranova and brutal killed about ten Scoia'tael. Oh, and not forgetting, awakening an unhealthy desire in Keira Metz.' 'Horrible,' Yennefer exaggeratedly wrinkled her brow.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt. Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop. Everyone knows that the affair on Thanedd was Nilfgaard's doing.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is. Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts. She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face. She was not fooled.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"She was not fooled. A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident. Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts. She had already guessed that some of those collected here were in opposite camps during the Thanedd rebellion; she was not surprised, therefore, when the antipathies came to the table in the form of remarks aimed at Yennefer.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"Damn, thought Yennefer, with effort keeping an indifferent expression on her face. What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes... 'There will therefore be a great opportunity,' Keira Metz cried excitedly 'to regain Ciri and also rip the skin from Vilgefortz, then set fire to the floor under the rogue's ass!' 'Burning the ground will be preceded by discovering Vilgefortz hideout,' Sile de Tansarville scoffed, who had never had much sympathy for Yennefer. 'And so far none have succeeded.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"Triss no doubt had committed her whole soul to the Lodge already. And no doubt sense that Yennefer's loyalty was still uncertain. Triss tried to comfort her, to ensure her that Geralt was safe and was recovering in Brokilon with the dryads who were helping him back to health. As always, talk of Geralt made her blush. He must have accommodated her, Yennefer thought without malice.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"'You are a flock of idiots. If we are to hear anything today, then it must be in order. Tell us, grandfather, about the Geralt and his companions and how they left the Yaruga.' 'I want to hear about Yennefer!' Nimue squeaked. 'Me too,' said Orla, her older sister. 'Of the love between her and the Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"Hey, grandfather! Do not sleep! Tell us of the Geralt Geralt, from the point where the company was leaving the Yaruga.' 'But first,' interjected Bronik, 'Tell us about all the others, grandfather, let us not be bothered by our curiosity. What happened to them? Briefly about Yennefer and Ciri.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Yennefer
"I wrote:  the scoundrel . Fine, the scoundrel Stefan Skellena. ''And you know as well as I, dear Phil, that the intelligence services of Emhyr are urgently looking for only those agents and emissaries, who vowed to rip Emhyr apart. Those who were meant to do his bidding in the cities or die, but betrayed him, their commands left unexecuted. Things look pretty strange, however we were confident that Cahir was ordered to capture princess Ciri and deliver her to Nilfgaard.'' New paragraph.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"At her command there soon arrived to my commando unit a certain Rience, reportedly a factotum of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, also a sorcerer. In the deepest secrecy a plan of action was developed, aimed at eliminating a number of wizards at the Congress on the island of Thanedd. The plan was presented to me as an action that had the full support of the Emperor Emhyr, Vattier de Rideaux and Stefan Skellen, otherwise I would not have agrees to cooperate with the Dh'oine, sorcerers or not, because I have seen too many provocations in my life. The involvement of the empire in this affair was confirmed at Cape Bremervoord by the arrival of the vessel that brought Cahir, the son of Ceallach, equipped with special powers of attorney and orders. According to these orders I was to appoint a small group of my commandos which was subject only to Cahir.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"And then let's move on to discuss the reason I invited you.' Fringilla Vigo stroked the cat that rubbed against her leg, purring and stretching, pretending it was a gesture of affection, not a veiled suggestion that the black-haired sorceress was in it's chair. 'Is it true,' she said, without raising her head, 'that Seneschal Ceallach aep Gryffyd visited you, right?' 'Yes,' Assire confirmed. 'Ceallach visited me, in despair, asking me for help for intercession, with his son, whom Emperor Emhyr has ordered captured, tortured and executed. To whom is a desperate father to turn to, if not a relative? Mawr, Ceallach's wife, the mother of Cahir, is my niece, my sister's youngest daughter.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"She was afraid that her friend wanted to get involved in the business of Cahir, the son of Ceallach, a matter that smelled of the scaffold. And if she had been asked for help, she would not be able to refuse. 'About mid-July,' she began, 'the entire court of Loc Grim had the opportunity to admire a fifteen year old girl, who was allegedly the princess of Cintra, which, during the audience, Emhyr portrayed as the queen and treated her so graciously, that rumours spread about the imminent marriage.' 'I heard,' Assire stroke the cat, which had become discouraged that Fringilla would not move, considered the possibility of getting into another chair, 'that there is still talk about this undoubtedly political marriage.' 'But in lower voices and less often. Because the Cintran princess has been taken to Darn Rowan. Darn Rowan, as you know, is usually known for housing prisoners.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"They threw him in the dungeon a week later.' 'I'm afraid I don't understand what this has to do with Cahir, son of Ceallach.' 'Patience. Let me do this is order, It is necessary.' 'Sorry. I'm listening.' 'Do you remember what Emhyr gave us three years ago when we began to look?' 'A lock of hair.' 'Right.' Fringilla reached into her purse. 'Precisely this hair. The light hair of a girl of six years.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"Nevertheless, the locks belong to two completely different people. I have examined them and there is no doubt about it.' 'I imagined a revelation of this kind,' Assire admitted, 'as soon as I heard that the Cintran had been isolated in Darn Rowan. The astrologer either failed to find the correct subject or was pulled into a conspiracy to provide a fake person to Emhyr. The conspiracy that will cost the head of Cahir aep Ceallach. Thank you, Fringilla.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"Stefan Skellen, who was sent there, found nothing but scorpions and vultures.' 'I would not have expected anything else from Xarthisius. But this will not have any influence on the issue of Cahir. Emhyr is angry, but he does not send anyone to torture and death for no reason. As you yourself have said, someone arranged for the fake princess to be delivered to Loc Grim. Someone has found a double.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"I will not rule out that it was unconsciously. That he was used.' 'If he had, they would have done so until the end. He would have been the one to bring the double to Emhyr. But Cahir has disappeared without a trace. Why?",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"Would realize because he was...' 'A lock of hair,' interrupted Assire. 'A lock of hair from a six year old girl. Fringilla, Emhyr has not been looking for this girl for three years, but much longer. It seems that Cahir has been pulled into something terrible, something that began when he was still riding around on a stick pretending it was a horse. Humm...",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Cahir
"We are writing to Philippa, not to the royal council, the letter has to look aesthetically pleasing! New paragraph. I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"When you hear what is said in Montecalvo, you'll see that I'm telling the truth... Yennefer, I do not like the glow I see in your eyes. Give me your word that you will not try to flee.' 'No.' Yennefer shook her head, covering her obsidian star with her hand. 'I can not do that, Francesca.' 'I would sincerely warn you, my dear, that all stationary target portals are blocked. Whoever tries to teleport inside or out without Philippa's permission lands in a cell lined with dimeritium.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Welcome, Francesca,' Philippa said. Her voice betrayed no emotions, but her eyes immediately narrow with caution. 'Welcome, Yennefer.' 'I had the privilege of filling two seats,' the melodiously golden-haired elf named Francesca said, clearly noting Philippa's astonishment. 'Here are my candidates. You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"I do not think, however, that excessive and unnecessary straining of our memory will bring any benefit to us here in this room. What we are going to undertake, would be server better by forgetting, forgiveness and reconciliation. Do you agree with me, Yennefer?' The black-haired sorceress tossed a spiral curl from her forehead. 'When I finally find out what you intend to undertake here,' she said, 'I'll tell you, Philippa, what I agree with. And what I don't.' 'In that case it would be best if we start without delay.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"And when all eyes are turned to you, Nilfgaardians, there will be no other way, you will have to talk. And then clarify some issues, then I too can find out more. How Yennefer disappeared from Thanedd, why she has suddenly appeared her in Montecalvo, along with Francesca. And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts. She had already guessed that some of those collected here were in opposite camps during the Thanedd rebellion; she was not surprised, therefore, when the antipathies came to the table in the form of remarks aimed at Yennefer. It looked as if a quarrel was to break out, which was prevented by Philippa Eilhart who unceremoniously banged her open palm onto the top of the table until the cups and goblets rang. 'Enough!' she shouted.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Well, she thought, because of it occurring it has created this Lodge. The devil knows how it will end, but it is to begin. 'Continue, Yennefer.' Philippa said. 'I have nothing more to say.' The black-haired sorceress pursed her lips. 'I repeat, it was Tissaia de Vries who ordered me to bring Ciri to Garstang.' 'It is easier to blame everything on the dead.' Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Those who carry the gene, have it available even in their hair. I examined her hairs and I found something I did not understand. Now I get it.' 'So Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' Yennefer said quietly. 'She is not there.' 'She is not there.' Philippa Eilhart confirmed seriously. 'Emhyr was cheated, someone slipped him a doppelganger.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"He tricked Emhyr and us!' Yennefer took calming breaths. Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes. Damn, thought Yennefer, with effort keeping an indifferent expression on her face. What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes...",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Others do what they must. At the end of the day, life smiles on a lucky few, unless you're a whore. They pay me for a craft that I love truly and sincerely.' *** Yennefer greeted with relief, joy and hope the break for a snack and the wetting of dry throats, proposed by Philippa. It became immediately clear that her hopes were going to be dashed. Margarita m clearly wished to speak with her, Philippa quickly pulled her to the other end of the hall.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
"Especially now, in these conditions with the war blockade... The blockades are a terrible thing. Agreed?' Yennefer coughed softly. 'I noticed,' Fringilla swallowed an oyster, then reached for another one, 'Yes, Philippa is watching us. Assire too.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Philippa
Laughed the troubadour. Roach. The Geralt agreed. Very nice. Geralt?,Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"Have you ever had a horse called Roach? No. The Geralt said after a moment's thought. I have not. Hurry your lazy Pegasus, Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"Roach, who was frightened, stamped and danced. Pegasus kept an imperturbable calm. Geralt! Yelled Dandelion, trying to outshout another thunder clap, rolling through the forest like a giant wagon. Let us go!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"They were alone among the trees in the forest. Or so they thought. Geralt first heard the whinny of a horse following them. With a stony face, he turned Roach. Dandelion opened his mouth, but Milva passed him a silent gesture, she took her bow from the quiver on her saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"He'll not be able to follow. Cahir, son of Ceallach, took one jump and caught his chestnut stallion, leapt into the saddle and galloped off, shouting at the horse to run faster. The Geralt watched him for a moment, climbed onto Roach, and rode on. In silence. Not looking back.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"Familiar with the horse, she was able to force the gelding to a gallop. Or rather a sluggish run, which Pegasus considered a gallop. But even this pseudo-gallop was enough to catch the horse thieves, since their escape was slowed by a more unusual horse: Roach, the Geralt's bay mare, which Geralt had promised more than once to replace with a donkey, mule or even a goat. Milva overtook the thieves when the unskilful rider pulling on Roach's reins fell to the ground and the rest of the peasants jumped from their saddles, trying to tame the frisky, kicking mare. They were so busy that they did not noticed when Milva came up on Pegasus and kicked one in the face, breaking his nose.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"Bad luck or fate? The cranes blew a trumpeting call. *** Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy rode at the head of the procession mounted on a Nilfgaardian bay captured by the Geralt in Armeria. The stallion, although at first it was bothered by the vampire and his herbal scent, soon became accustomed and caused little trouble unlike Roach who kicked like he was being bitten by horseflies. Behind Regis and Geralt rode Dandelion on Pegasus with his head bandaged like a war hero.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Roach
"And then let's move on to discuss the reason I invited you.' Fringilla Vigo stroked the cat that rubbed against her leg, purring and stretching, pretending it was a gesture of affection, not a veiled suggestion that the black-haired sorceress was in it's chair. 'Is it true,' she said, without raising her head, 'that Seneschal Ceallach aep Gryffyd visited you, right?' 'Yes,' Assire confirmed. 'Ceallach visited me, in despair, asking me for help for intercession, with his son, whom Emperor Emhyr has ordered captured, tortured and executed. To whom is a desperate father to turn to, if not a relative? Mawr, Ceallach's wife, the mother of Cahir, is my niece, my sister's youngest daughter.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"She was afraid that her friend wanted to get involved in the business of Cahir, the son of Ceallach, a matter that smelled of the scaffold. And if she had been asked for help, she would not be able to refuse. 'About mid-July,' she began, 'the entire court of Loc Grim had the opportunity to admire a fifteen year old girl, who was allegedly the princess of Cintra, which, during the audience, Emhyr portrayed as the queen and treated her so graciously, that rumours spread about the imminent marriage.' 'I heard,' Assire stroke the cat, which had become discouraged that Fringilla would not move, considered the possibility of getting into another chair, 'that there is still talk about this undoubtedly political marriage.' 'But in lower voices and less often. Because the Cintran princess has been taken to Darn Rowan. Darn Rowan, as you know, is usually known for housing prisoners.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"Rarely women candidates for empress.' Assire made no comment. She waited patiently; looking at her recently filed and painted nails. 'Undoubtedly, you remember,' Fringilla Vigo continued, 'how three years ago, Emhyr called us all and ordered us to establish the whereabouts of a person. In the area of the Northern Kingdoms. Undoubtedly, you remember how mad he was when we did not succeed.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"They threw him in the dungeon a week later.' 'I'm afraid I don't understand what this has to do with Cahir, son of Ceallach.' 'Patience. Let me do this is order, It is necessary.' 'Sorry. I'm listening.' 'Do you remember what Emhyr gave us three years ago when we began to look?' 'A lock of hair.' 'Right.' Fringilla reached into her purse. 'Precisely this hair. The light hair of a girl of six years.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"Nevertheless, the locks belong to two completely different people. I have examined them and there is no doubt about it.' 'I imagined a revelation of this kind,' Assire admitted, 'as soon as I heard that the Cintran had been isolated in Darn Rowan. The astrologer either failed to find the correct subject or was pulled into a conspiracy to provide a fake person to Emhyr. The conspiracy that will cost the head of Cahir aep Ceallach. Thank you, Fringilla.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"Would realize because he was...' 'A lock of hair,' interrupted Assire. 'A lock of hair from a six year old girl. Fringilla, Emhyr has not been looking for this girl for three years, but much longer. It seems that Cahir has been pulled into something terrible, something that began when he was still riding around on a stick pretending it was a horse. Humm...",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"But we can not exclude the possibility that this was not about politics, but the Elder Blood gene, which Emhyr wants to introduce into the imperial line. If Emhyr knows that we want to fulfil the prophecy he may wish for the future Queen of the World to be born in Nilfgaard.' 'A correction,' Sabrina Glevissig interjected. 'This is not what Emhyr wants, but Nilfgaard's sorcerers. Only they could track down the gene and Emhyr has realized its importance. The present Nilfgaardian ladies here probably want to confirm and clarify their role in the plot.' 'It amazes me,' Fringilla said firmly, 'the tendency of women to find intrigue in distant Nilfgaard, while the indicators suggest looking for conspirators and traitors closer to home.' 'An observation as straightforward as it is accurate.' Sile de Tansarville silenced Sabrina with a serious look, who was preparing to respond.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"Have you forgotten about Vilgefortz, ladies?' 'I have not.' Sabrina's eyes burned for a moment with the fire of hatred. 'I have not forgotten!' 'The time will come for him,' Keira Metz teeth flashed ominously. 'But for now, this is not about him, but about Ciri and the Elder Blood which is so important to us, who is held by Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard.' 'The Emperor,' Assire said quietly, looking at Fringilla, 'has nothing in his hands. The girl being held in Rowan is not a carrier of any extraordinary gene. She is normal to commonplace.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Fringilla
"Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood. He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"In the appropriate place, a tub of warm water. You've hurt enough of the goldfish.' *** Francesca and Ida Emean drank wine. Yennefer drank large amounts of carrot juice. 'Let me summarize,' she said, after hearing Francesca. 'Nilfgaard conquered Lyria, destroyed half of Aedirn and Kaedwen, and burned Vengerberg.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"My house in Vengerberg has been burned, I am persecuted. There is nothing I can do, but join some Scoia'tael commandos. Or otherwise join the fight for the freedom of the elves.' Yennefer took a sip of carrot juice and stared in the eyes of Ida Emean aep Sivney, who was staying quiet and calm. 'Well, Lady Ida? Lady Aen Seidhe of the free Blue Mountains?",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"After all, you were always of the opinion that magic is of the highest value, standing above all the divisions, conflicts, political choices, personal interests, resentments and animosity. You will probably enjoy the news; we recently established a framework for such an institution, something like a secret lodge, set up solely to defend the interests of magic, having the task of ensuring that magic will occupy a place in the social hierarchy, where it belongs. I allowed myself to be able to consider two new candidates for this structure, Ida Emean aep Sivney and you.' 'What an unexpected honour and promotion,' Yennefer sneered. 'From nonexistence, straight into the secret, elitist, magical lodge. An institution standing above personal resentments and animosity.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"I'm going to explode at any moment. And that is before I start to wonder why you recommended me for this lodge instead of another elf of Dol Blathanna or the Blue Mountains.' 'In Montecalvo,' Francesca replied coldly, 'you can find out why.' 'I'd rather not wait.' 'Tell her.' Ida Emean murmured. 'It's about Ciri,' Francesca said after a moment's thought, staring at Yennefer with impenetrable eyes. 'The Lodge is interested in her. And nobody knows the girl as well as you.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"'Welcome, Yennefer.' 'I had the privilege of filling two seats,' the melodiously golden-haired elf named Francesca said, clearly noting Philippa's astonishment. 'Here are my candidates. You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg. And Lady Ida Emean aep Sivney, Aen Saevherne of the Blue Mountains.' Ida Emean bowed her head with her red hair slightly, her flowing dress rustled. 'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"Ida stood out among the group not only for her hair colour. Among her jewellery was not an ounce of minerals, or a precious stone, she wore only pearls, coral and amber. The source of the greatest excitement, however, was clearly the third sorceress, Yennefer, raven-haired, dressed in black and white, contrary to Fringilla's first impression, she was not an elf. Her appearance in Montecalvo had been a tremendous surprise, and not pleasant for everyone. Fringilla felt from some of the sorceresses an aura of antipathy and hostility.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"And when all eyes are turned to you, Nilfgaardians, there will be no other way, you will have to talk. And then clarify some issues, then I too can find out more. How Yennefer disappeared from Thanedd, why she has suddenly appeared her in Montecalvo, along with Francesca. And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"Dijkstra does not have her nor any of the kings, we know this. And in the ruins of the Tower of Gulls her body was not found.' 'Tor Lara,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'once concealed a very powerful portal. Can we exclude that the girl left Thanedd through this portal?' Yennefer closed her eyes and dug her nails into the head of the sphinxes fastened to the armrests of her chair. Keep calm, she thought, keep calm. She felt the eyes of Margarita on her, but did not raise her head.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Ida
"He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower. How typical it is for humans, Enid. To expect that we would immediately, on command, explain the mysteries and secrets that we ourselves have tried to unravel for centuries.' Francesca raised her hand and examined her rings. 'Interesting,' she said, 'and Philippa knows about the strange hobbies of Vattier and Skellen? And Emhyr var Emreis, whom they both serve.' 'It would be prudent to assume that she does not know.' Ida Emean looked keenly at the Queen.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"'It is a true story. Also among us is someone who knows not only the story of Lara and Cregennan, but also its consequences and these would also be very interesting for us all. We ask you to speak, Francesca.' 'From what you say,' the Queen of the Elves said smiling, 'you know the story about as well as I.' 'I do not deny it. But I beg you to tell us.' 'To prove my sincerity and loyalty to the Lodge,' Enid an Gleanna nodded. 'I will.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"The child was saved miraculously. Then sheltered by Cerro, Queen of Redania...' 'Terrified by the curse Lara gave her, because she refused to help and left her in the cold to freeze,' Keira Metz burst into the narrative. 'If she didn't take the child, a terrible disaster would befall her and her family...' 'These are the fabulous ornament, of which Francesca gave up.' Philippa interrupted. 'Keep to the facts.' 'The gift of prophecy to the Knowing from the Elder Blood is fact.' Ida Emean said, looking at Philippa. 'And the repetition in all versions of the legend, suggests the theme of prophecy provides food for thought.' 'In the past they did,' said Francesca.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"The rebellion began to spread to other countries...' 'Nilfgaardian historians have written about it.' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted with distinct irony. 'As Lady Assire and Lady Vigo have undoubtedly read. Shorten it, Francesca. Skip to Riannon and the triplets of Houtborg.' 'All right. Riannon, the daughter of Lara Dorren who was raised by Cerro the now wife of Goidemar the king of Temeria, was accidently captured by the rebel Falka and imprisoned in the castle of Houtborg.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"If the carrier is male, the gene is lost after the second or third generation.' 'But then activates again.' Philippa Eilhart said. 'Adalia, who was lacking the gene, was at the end of the day the mother of Calanthe and Calanthe was the grandmother of Ciri who is a carrier of the Lara gene.' 'The first since Riannon.' Sile de Tansarville spoke suddenly. 'You made a mistake, Francesca. There are two genes. One, the right one, was latent and you overlooked it in Fiona, deceived by the clear and strong gene in Amavet.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"And Pavetta's daughter, Ciri. The only one at this time who is heiress to the Elder Blood, the Lara gene carrier.' 'The only one?' Sile de Tansarville asked sharply. 'You are very sure of yourself, Enid.' 'What do you mean?' Sile rose suddenly, extended her fingers covered with rings in the direction of the fruit platter and levitated the rest of the fruit, destroying and transforming Francesca's whole scheme into a multi-coloured mess. 'This is what I mean,' she said coldly, pointed to the chaos of the fruit. 'For these are the possible genetic combinations.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Lara
"Nowhere could she see a naked black man beating a drum on the table or dancing girls clad only in jewellery nor smelt the odour of hashish or cantharides. The Nilfgaardian sorceresses were immediately welcomed by the lady of the castle, Philippa Eilhart, attentive, friendly and polite. Other sorceresses approached and introduced themselves and Fringilla breathed a sigh of relief. The magicians from the north were beautiful, charming and sparkled with jewellery, but in their eyes, gently emphasized by makeup, there was no hint of either drugs or nymphomania. None had exposed her breasts.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"Only Sabrina Glevissig refused, being a faithful daughter of Kaedwen's forests, she even expressed her contempt for the  slimy filth  and her desire for a piece of cold venison with prunes. Philippa Eilhart, instead of responding to the insult with icy haughtiness, pulled a bell rope and soon inconspicuous and noiseless servants delivered meat. Fringilla was astonished. Well, she thought, different regions, different manners. The portal between the columns began to brighten and vibrate.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"Triss froze her with a glare. Philippa made the introductions. Fringilla stared curiously at Francesca Findabair, Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, the famous Queen of Dol Blathanna, ruler of the elves who had recently regained their country. The rumours of her breath-taking beauty, Fringilla thought, are not exaggerated. Ida Emean, the red haired elf with deep eyes, was obviously genuinely interested in everything around her, including both Nilfgaardian sorceresses.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"'I am not surprised. I, however, I have a good memory for faces and silhouettes. I saw you on Sodden Hill.' 'And therefore there can be no mistake,' Fringilla Vigo proudly raised her head and ran her eyes over everyone. 'I was on the hill at Sodden.' Philippa Eilhart anticipated the response. 'I was also there,' she said, 'and I remember too, many things.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"And what I don't.' 'In that case it would be best if we start without delay. Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"Philippa started. She repeated her welcome and immediately proceeded with things. Fringilla was given a detailed briefing by Assire about the previous Lodge meeting and did not hear anything in the introduction that was new. She was not surprised by either the statements made by all the sorceresses, nor the first topic of discussion. But she was slightly embarrassed as the first concern voiced was the war with the Nilfgaardian Empire and especially the recently launched operations in Sodden and Brugge, during which the imperial army had clashed with the army of Temeria.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"The sorceresses expressed surprise and disbelief, demanding explanations. Some no doubt knew a lot about this foreseen ruler of the North, Ciri or Ciri another name they were familiar with, but they knew less. Fringilla Vigo knew nothing about the suspicions and speculations, and concentrated mainly on a certain lock of hair. Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent. Philippa Eilhart took the floor again.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident. Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts. She had already guessed that some of those collected here were in opposite camps during the Thanedd rebellion; she was not surprised, therefore, when the antipathies came to the table in the form of remarks aimed at Yennefer. It looked as if a quarrel was to break out, which was prevented by Philippa Eilhart who unceremoniously banged her open palm onto the top of the table until the cups and goblets rang.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"The blockades are a terrible thing. Agreed?' Yennefer coughed softly. 'I noticed,' Fringilla swallowed an oyster, then reached for another one, 'Yes, Philippa is watching us. Assire too. Assire is probably afraid for my loyalty to the Lodge.",Baptism of Fire,Fringilla,Philippa
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Figgis Merluzzo and Munro Bruys went in search of mushrooms. Zoltan, Yazon Yarda, Caleb Stratton and Percival Schuttenbach sprawled not far from the cart and played 'Screwed', their favourite card game, to which they devoted every free moment, even on wet evenings. The Geralt sometimes sat and played with them and encouraged them, as he did now. He still could not understand the complicated rules of the game, but he was fascinated by the cards themselves, which were beautifully and meticulously painted. Compared to human playing cards, these were true masterpieces of printing.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"said Dandelion. Percival Schuttenbach made his way to the cart and in the blink of an eye provided the required items. The Geralt winked at the company, then with all his strength began banging the spoon on the lid. Enough! Enough!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"And I don't deny that,  Zoltan shrugged. Because inevitably it came from our forge. You Geralts, know how to brandish your swords, but do not make them. They are only made in Mahakam, beneath Mount Carbon. Dwarves temper the steel,  added Percival,  And forge the main layers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"You would have cut it to pieces without much effort. The talk of swords and metallurgy continued for some time. Geralt listened with interest, shared his own experiences, and took the opportunity to enrich his knowledge asking about this and that, examining and testing Zoltan's sihill. He did not know that the very next day he would have to demonstrate the theory with practice. The first sign that people lived in the area, was a very regular stack of bark chips, which Percival Schuttenbach had spotted by the road while he was at the front of the group.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"When you hear a strange noise, that you do not recognise, that'll be me. Percival, you lead. Geralt, you going with us? We'll all go. Dandelion dismounted.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"If we had to run, we could do nothing but leave the cart with all of your packs and sacks. ' The dwarf snorted angrily into his beard, but surprisingly Percival Schuttenbach supported the troubadour. Support, the Geralt saw, which was accompanied by several significant winks. It was assumed the winks were to be stealthy, but the exaggerated pantomime of the little gnome's face excluded discretion. 'The poet is right.' Percival said, grimacing and blinking.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Could you be mistaken, gnome?' 'No,' protested Percival. 'Do you see that boulder that looks like a broken table? The ghoul is hidden there, behind that rock.' 'Stay here.' Geralt, with a quick movement drew the sword from the sheath on his back. 'Look after the women and care for the horses. If the ghoul attacks the horses will go crazy.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"You've stirred up fear where none was needed; you really do deserve a kick in the ass.' 'I saw it!' The gnome persisted. 'I saw it jump between the rocks! He was thin and black as a tax collector...' 'Shut up, stupid gnome, because of you...' 'What is that strange odor?' Geralt asked suddenly. 'Do you notice it?' 'You're right.' Said the dwarf, sniffing like a bloodhound. 'It smells weird.' 'Herbs.' Said Percival, sucking in air through his long sensitive nose.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Percival was not mistaken. The man did in fact look like a tax collector. 'I can go without fear?' He asked, lifting his black eyes under shaggy greying eyebrows to Geralt. 'You can.' The man scrambled out of the hole, brushed his black coat, tied at the waist with something resembling an apron, straighten his canvas bag, causing another wave of herbal scents. 'Gentlemen, I propose that you put away your weapons,' he said in a calm voice, his eyes searching the surroundings.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Oh yes, just to be sure...' 'Get in there and ask to borrow a fork.' 'Why a fork?' 'Why not?' The dwarf looked up at him, but finally decided to; he strode to the hut, knocked on the door frame and entered. He spent a long time inside, before he again appeared at the door. 'Geralt, Percival, Dandelion, come see something interesting. Well, go ahead, Regis has invited you.' The interior of the cabin was dark and filled with heavy, intoxication smells from bundles of herbs and spices hanging on the walls. The only furniture was a bed, also covered in herbs, and a crooked table, covered with countless glass, earthenware and porcelain bottles.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest. 'Are you deaf? The moonshine is made of mandrake.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"useful.' 'For what?' 'For drills and files. For bearings. I had a whole pile...' 'Do you hear that, Geralt?' Zoltan waved his arms in the air, almost knocking himself over on his back. 'He dreams of a heap of diamonds. Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep! He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him. He did not have time to reflect on this unusual phenomenon as one of the soldiers hit him with a spear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"The guards standing next to the shed chatted idly, laughing and occasionally cleared their throats and spat for long periods. The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival
"'I'm glad to see you alive and healthy. Even with the parrot.' 'Damn it!' Zoltan Chivay dropped his cards in surprise, after which he jumped to his feet so suddenly that Field Marshal Duda, who was on his shoulder, flapped his wings and shrieked with terror. 'The Geralt has found us! Or is he a mirage? Percival, do you see what I'm seeing?' Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Percival

The involvement of the empire in this affair was confirmed at Cape Bremervoord by the arrival of the vessel that brought Cahir, the son of Ceallach, equipped with special powers of attorney and orders.

"Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood. He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Vattier
"He is called Field Marshal Duda. And this is the rest of my company. This is Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda, Caleb Stratton, Figgis Merluzzo and Percival ... Schuttenbach. Percival Schuttenbach was not a dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"Yazon, Munro, go and search the carts. If something useful survived, load it up quickly. Figgis, see if our wheel will fit onto that small wagon, it would be perfect for us. It fits! Yelled the dwarf who dragged the wheel.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"Milva had disappeared. The dwarves rested, but remained active. Figgis Merluzzo and Munro Bruys went in search of mushrooms. Zoltan, Yazon Yarda, Caleb Stratton and Percival Schuttenbach sprawled not far from the cart and played 'Screwed', their favourite card game, to which they devoted every free moment, even on wet evenings. The Geralt sometimes sat and played with them and encouraged them, as he did now.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"Just behind him rushed Zoltan Chivay, seizing his sword wrapped in its skins on the cart. Percival Schuttenbach and the rest of the dwarves ran after them, armed with their clubs and at the back Dandelion followed, who'd been awakened by the screaming. From one side, Figgis and Munro appeared. Throwing their baskets of mushrooms down, both dwarves caught the fleeing children. Milva came out of nowhere, pulling an arrow from her quiver and pointing it in the direction the cry had come from.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"Maybe there was a big battle, Nilfgaard was pushed back, maybe the front is behind us, and the peasants and their cows returned home? We need to find out. Figgis, Munro, both of you stay here and keep your eyes open. We will do a little reconnaissance. If there is danger, I'll let you know with the call of the Sparrowhawk.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"'Well, good.' He said finally, looking at the remains of the cart, floating down the river on a lazy current. 'We'll separate. Munro, Figgis, Caleb and Yazon will stay here. The rest of us will continue. We will have to load the horses with provisions and equipment.",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"'The Geralt has found us! Or is he a mirage? Percival, do you see what I'm seeing?' Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him. And when the rest of the company emerged from behind the piles of logs, the shouts of delight intensified accordingly. 'Milva!",Baptism of Fire,Figgis,Munro
"Francesca Findabair called Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, waited until the door closed behind Vattier and stroked her cats. 'Already, Ida.' she said. Ida Emean aep Sivney, the elven sorceress, a free Aen Seidhe from the Blue Mountains, hidden during the audience by a spell of invisibility, appeared in the corner of the room, adjusting her mahogany hair. The ocelots responded by only slightly opening their eyes a little wider. Like all cats, they could see the invisible, their senses could not be easily fooled by magic.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things.

How typical it is for humans, Enid.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"Or otherwise join the fight for the freedom of the elves.' Yennefer took a sip of carrot juice and stared in the eyes of Ida Emean aep Sivney, who was staying quiet and calm. 'Well, Lady Ida? Lady Aen Seidhe of the free Blue Mountains? Is this what is written for me, my divine destiny? Why are you silent like a boulder?' 'I, Lady Yennefer,' replied the redheaded elf, 'I am silent when I have nothing meaningful to say.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"'Here are my candidates. You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg. And Lady Ida Emean aep Sivney, Aen Saevherne of the Blue Mountains.' Ida Emean bowed her head with her red hair slightly, her flowing dress rustled. 'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes. 'And Scoia'tael hidden in the basement.' Keira Metz muttered.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"Ida Emean, the red haired elf with deep eyes, was obviously genuinely interested in everything around her, including both Nilfgaardian sorceresses. The free elves of the Blue Mountains did not maintain any relationships with not only humans, but even their own blood relatives living close to humans. And the Aen Saevherne, the Knowing, were very few among the free elves, and were a closer to being legends. Few people, even among the elves, could boast of a close contact with an Aen Saevherne. Ida stood out among the group not only for her hair colour.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"And then clarify some issues, then I too can find out more. How Yennefer disappeared from Thanedd, why she has suddenly appeared her in Montecalvo, along with Francesca. And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence. And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is.",Baptism of Fire,Aen,Ida
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"Scout Percival reported to them several times about groups of refugees hiding in the forest. They passed several such groups, and quickly at that, because the peasants, armed with pitchforks and stakes did not encourage them to make contact. It was suggested, however, to try to negotiate with them and leave the group of women from Kernow, but Zoltan was opposed to it and Milva supported him. The women also did not seem very keen to leave the company. This made it all the more strange that they behaved towards the dwarves with reserve and a certain dislike, mingled with fear, they hardly spoke at rest stops and stood on the sidelines.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"'Ha! Now they will know that gluttony leads to destruction! Milva, tuck an arrow in his ass and I'll bag the guts!' 'I see nothing there,' Milva whispered with the fletching of the arrow resting on her cheek. 'Nothing but the weeds among the rocks are moving. Could you be mistaken, gnome?' 'No,' protested Percival.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"From the group of people fighting for survival arises the delightful smell of cabbage stew and vegetables, without which, it seems, they can not survive. The distinctive accent of perfume also forms the effect of physiological needs, handled wherever they can, usually on the outskirts of the encampment. I could never understand why the struggle for survival manifested a reluctance to dig latrines.' 'May you be swept away with the devil for all your clever chatter,' Milva said angrily. 'Instead of using fifty unintelligible words, use just three: Cabbage and shit.' 'Cabbage and shit always comes in pairs,' Percival Schuttenbach proclaimed a profound truth. 'One produces the other.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The old woman lied. And you Aunt Milva, you're no pervert with a bow, Aunt Milva, I like you. For you I've picked the prettiest flowers.' 'Thank you.' said Milva with a sad voice. 'We all thank you.' Zoltan repeated. 'Hey, Percival, you disgusting underground goblin, give the child a present.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The encampment was a smoking ruin after the assault, but it appeared the peasants who survived did not flee too far. Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The guards standing next to the shed chatted idly, laughing and occasionally cleared their throats and spat for long periods. The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself. Even if they survived, they cannot help us.' 'Why?' 'For three reasons. First, because they have their own problems.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"Percival, do you see what I'm seeing?' Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him. And when the rest of the company emerged from behind the piles of logs, the shouts of delight intensified accordingly. 'Milva! Regis!' Zoltan shouted, squeezing all. 'Dandelion, alive, albeit with a bandage on his head!",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Percival
"The barn exploded with a loud cry and the applause of dozens of hands. 'Falka, you devil,' Spark gasped for breath. 'When we get tired of robbery, we can head into the world to make money as dancers...' Ciri was also gasping for breath. She was incapable of speech and could only laugh breathlessly. Tears ran down her face.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka
"'What do you think, that... The girl was screaming in her sleep! It was a nightmare!' 'Did you scream, Falka?' Ciri nodded. 'Was it a terrible dream? What did you dream?' 'Leave her alone!' 'Shut up, Mistle.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka
"'Let the fun begin.' Mistle said jumping into the saddle and drawing her sword. 'For some time now you have enjoyed this more than the others, Falka. Don't think that I haven't noticed.' Ciri angrily struck the horse with her heels. They galloped down the slope of the ravine in fits and starts, listening to the wild shouts of the rest of the Rats, coming out of the woods from the other side of the road. The jaws of the trap closed.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka
"Help me release the harness! Falka! Move!' Ciri did not take her eyes off the coat of arms on the door of the carriage, a silver unicorn on a black background. A unicorn, she thought. I once saw such a unicorn...",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka
"He wanted a wife for his son, also called Coram, but knew of the rumours and would not marry his son if possible to Falka's bastard. We assured them with our authority that Fiona was the legitimate daughter of the royal family. I do not know if they believed us, however, they young prince found her to his tastes and the daughter of Riannon, ancestor of Ciri, became the queen on Cintra.' 'Bringing to the famous dynasty of Coram the gene that were following.' 'Fiona,' Enid an Gleanna said calmly, 'was not a carrier of the Elder Blood gene. Which we have called the Lara gene.' 'How is that?' 'The carrier of the Lara gene was Amavet and our experiment continued. Because Anna Kameny, whose husband had killed her lover, still in mourning gave birth to twins.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka
"She arrived on the Skellige Islands and found allies there. Because you see, her anger was great at the wizard Vilgefortz. She was convinced that he had kidnapped Ciri and she was determined to track him down, have her revenge and rescue Ciri. And that's all I will tell you for now.' 'What about Ciri?' 'Ciri was with the Rats, hiding under the name of Falka. She took to the bandit's life because, although nobody knew it then, in that girl was wickedness and cruelty, all that is wrong, which is hidden in each person, had emerged from her and gradually took advantage over the good.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Falka

Then Francesca Findabair, known as Enid an Gleanna, the current ruler of the Valley of Flowers.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"It's a sad fate that awaits us all. Sabrina finished quickly. Philippa, Triss and I, all three of us were at Sodden Hill. Emhyr will make us pay, as we will pay forThanedd, and for the entirety of our involvement. But this is just one of the reservations that stops me from agreeing to the declared political neutrality of the convention.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"The magicians from the north were beautiful, charming and sparkled with jewellery, but in their eyes, gently emphasized by makeup, there was no hint of either drugs or nymphomania. None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina

Other ice was not palpable. Sile de Tansarville, a researcher, immediately found a lot of common topics with the researcher Assire var Anahid and Fringilla quickly gained a liking to the cheerful Triss Merigold. The conversations were accompanied by the greed absorption of oysters. Only Sabrina Glevissig refused, being a faithful daughter of Kaedwen's forests, she even expressed her contempt for the  slimy filth  and her desire for a piece of cold venison with prunes.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
Sabrina Glevissig face was covered in unbounded astonishment. Keira Metz dropped the oyster knife onto the ice. Triss Merigold gasped loudly. Three sorceresses came through the portal. Three elves.,Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes. 'And Scoia'tael hidden in the basement.' Keira Metz muttered. Triss froze her with a glare. Philippa made the introductions. Fringilla stared curiously at Francesca Findabair, Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, the famous Queen of Dol Blathanna, ruler of the elves who had recently regained their country.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"But I never questioned her abilities.' 'She will tell everything!' Sabrina Glevissig shouted. 'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Sabrina
"When they entered, the music immediately stopped, dying in mid note. The villagers sweaty and tired from dancing away, huddled along the walls and posts. Ciri, walking beside Mistle, saw the startled eyes of the girls and women, hard, unfriendly looks from the younger boys and men. She heard whispering and muttering, in a short time it became as loud as the bleating of bagpipes, and the hum of a violin. They whispered: 'Rats, Rats...",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle
"'You're quick with the sword! What about dancing? Can you follow the steps?' Ciri, released herself from Mistle's arms, unwound the scarf from her neck and took off her beret and jacket. She jumped onto the table next to the elf. The villagers cheered, the drums boomed and the bagpipes whined.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle
"Dance, Spark! Clap, Mistle!' The fiddle and the flute played a sharp closing note. Spark and Ciri end their dance by stomping their heels, their elbows continuing to touch. Breathless, shaky, sweaty, they dash to each other, to embrace, each covered in sweat, heat and happiness. The barn exploded with a loud cry and the applause of dozens of hands.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle
"'What's happening?' The cave was dark, though outside the sun was shining. The Rats rested after a night spent in the saddle fleeing pursuers. Giselher put a torch into the fire, lit it up, stood up and approached the place where Ciri and Mistle slept together, as usual, away from the rest of the gang. Ciri sat with her head bowed, Mistle covered it. Giselher raised the torch.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle
"Giselher raised the torch. The others also approached. Mistle covered Ciri's bare shoulder with a fur. 'Listen, Mistle,' the leader of the Rats said seriously, 'I have never interfered into what you two do in bed. I have never said a word of derision.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle

Mistle withdrew her hand which was tickling the back of Ciri's neck, stretched out beside her, folded her hands under her shaved head and stared at the sky. 'You have been acting strange lately, Hawk.' 'I just don't want to be touched, that's all.' 'It was just a game.' 'I know,' Ciri pursed her lips, 'it's just a game. All this was to you was a game.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle

"Giselher, Reef and Iskra cut off their retreat and after a short struggle unceremoniously slit their throats.

They had left her with none. It looked like she was not going to get to kill.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle
"The coachman threw down his reins and also begged for mercy, clasping his hands as if in prayer. Giselher, Iskra and Mistle approached the carriage, Kayleigh jumped down from his horse and jerked open the door. Ciri pulled her horse up closer and dismounted, still holding in her hand the sword covered in blood. In the carriage sat a plump matron in robes and a cap, embracing a terribly pale young girl dressed in black, buttoned to the neck with a lace collar. The dress Ciri noticed was fastened with a gem.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Mistle

"This hand obviosuly hasn't served him very well in defense,  Milva muttered. Still, something here does not make sense.

Remove the gag from his mouth, Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"Still the same. Milva and Dandelion were silent. Ciri,  he took a moment,  does not sleep in the palace under a brocade canopy. She's riding on horseback through some dusty village ... The villagers point fingers.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"They did not know how to defend themselves. The girl with braids rose onto all fours, then stood on her feet, and with shaking hands tried unsuccessfully to improve the remnants of her torn garments. The Geralt was surprised, seeing that in general, she was in absolutely no way similar to Ciri, when only a moment before he swore she looked like her twin sister. With an uncoordinated movement the girl rubbed her face, and moved unsteadily towards the cottage, not avoiding the puddle of manure. Hey, wait,  called Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion. 'You were seriously wounded, a carter drove you out. At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"'Are you really offended?' 'No.' he denied. 'So why do you stand here alone in the moonlight?' 'I'm counting.' 'Huh?' 'Since we left Brokilon, twelve days have passed, during which we have travelled about sixty miles. Ciri, so the rumors say, is in Nilfgaard, the capital of the empire, a place that separates me by two thousand five hundred miles. A simple calculation shows that at this rate I'll get there in a year and four months. What do you say to that?' 'Nothing.' Milva shrugged her shoulders and cleared her throat again.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"Maria Barring. But they call me, Milva.' 'The Geralt is moving in the wrong direction, Milva,' he said after a moment. 'Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. It was not Nilfgaard who kidnapped her.

"Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning.

"This morning I let a higher vampire get away from my sword, who surely has on his conscience many human lives. I should have killed him. I am only interested in one thing: to get at the skins of those who have hurt Ciri. I vowed to myself that those who have hurt her will pay for it with their blood.' Cahir remained silent. 'Your revelation, which Milva told me about, does not change anything.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"'I wonder what' 'Like you, I want to save Ciri. Like you, I do not care if this is odd and surprises people. Like you, I have no intention of telling anyone my reasons.' 'Is that all?' 'No.' 'I'm listening.' 'Ciri,' the Nilfgaardian started slowly, 'is on horseback riding through a dusty village, with six young people. Among these people is a girl with short-cut hair. Ciri dances in a shed on a table and is happy...' 'Milva told you my dreams.' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"'And when one considers the situation, we reach the conclusion that we are dealing with a problem that is unsolvable. This entire project is devoid of opportunities for success. The probability of finding Ciri is zero.' 'Oh yes,' Milva ridiculed 'Isn't this only a matter of initiative and positive thinking, as with the strainer. If we don't have something, then we will replace it with something else. So I thought.' 'Until recently,' the vampire continued, 'we thought Ciri was in Nilfgaard.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"So I thought.' 'Until recently,' the vampire continued, 'we thought Ciri was in Nilfgaard. Getting there and rescuing her or stealing her seemed an impossible task. Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is. It is difficult to speak of initiative when you have no idea what direction to go.' 'What shall we do then?' Milva pouted. 'The Geralt insists we move south...' 'For him,' Regis smiled, 'the cardinal points have no meaning.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"The rest will follow. In other words, movement is everything, the goal is nothing.' 'That's silly,' said Milva. 'His goal is Ciri. Is she not important to him?' 'I joke,' admitted the vampire, watching Geralt with his back still turned. 'Without much tact.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"Sorry. Your right, dear Milva. Our goal is Ciri. And we don't know where she is, it makes sense to learn that and conveniently manage our activities. The Child Surprise, I notice is bursting with magic and other supernatural predestination.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses. They might not want to talk to us, let alone use magic.' 'Regis,' reminded the Geralt, 'knows someone among those of Caed Dhu.' 'And this knowledge doesn't go back three or four hundred years?' 'It is far more recent,' the vampire said with an enigmatic smile.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Milva
"He'll not be able to follow. Cahir, son of Ceallach, took one jump and caught his chestnut stallion, leapt into the saddle and galloped off, shouting at the horse to run faster. The Geralt watched him for a moment, climbed onto Roach, and rode on. In silence. Not looking back.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"well, its not my business. Especially since we benefit from such a rear guard. Milva said, looking meaningfully at Geralt. Are you certain that this Cahir is your enemy? The Geralt did not answer.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"*** Over the next few days, they ate horse meat. The boots with shiny buckles were quite comfortable. The Nilfgaardian called Cahir still rode behind them on his chestnut stallion, but the Geralt did not look back. He finally figured out the secrets of Screwed and even played with the Dwarves. He lost.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth. 'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Of all of the commandos there were no more than twelve left and they were mostly wounded.' 'The wind favoured us. We disembarked west of Hirundum and hid in the woods. Cahir tore at his bandages, shouting something about a crazy lady with green eyes, about Ciri the lion of Cintra, about a Geralt who had destroyed his group and about a sorcerer who flew like a bird towards the Tower of Gulls. He asked for a horse and ordered us back to the island, claiming it was the Emperor's orders, which, in this situation, I had to consider the ravings of a madman. In Aedirn, as we already knew, the war was already raging and I thought it best to put together a new squad and resume the fighting against the Dh'oine.' 'Cahir was still with us when I found the contact box which contained your secret orders.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"He hates you... The two times he saved your life...' 'Three times.' 'Twice I was there. Though you are not the sorcerer who broke the Geralt's bones at Thanedd, I don't think it is safe for you to get close to his sword. What is between you I don't understand, but you saved me and I look at you kindly... So I tell you, Cahir, the Geralt is looking for those who kidnapped Ciri and took her to Nilfgaard, he grits his teeth so much that sparks fly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"You are not alone, I can see.' 'You see well,' Milva let go of Cahir's arm, who had already reached for his sword. 'I am not alone but the same cannot be said about yourself. Regis, where is the Geralt? Dandelion? And the rest?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"You go with the horses towards the brightest star of the Seven Goats. Wait at the river where the Chotla empties into the Ina. When I manage to free the Geralt, we'll head in that direction. There we will meet.' 'He is highly arrogant,' Cahir whispered to Milva after dismounting from their horses found them close to each other. 'Alone, without any help he is going into trouble, did you hear?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'So we have time to talk. Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"*** 'Dawn will be here soon,' Milva said not looking at the sky but at the glossy surface of the river. 'The catfish chase the salmon. But there is no sign of the Geralt or Dandelion. Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion. 'Pah...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"How much exactly?' 'Fuck off, Regis.' 'Of course. But before that, my valuation, please.' 'An ordinary vampire I would look at the equivalent of a good horse and saddle. But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Sounds carry down the river, before we know it we'll have enemies on our neck.' 'I will not go with him.' 'Then go alone!' She shouted angrily, in earnest. 'In another direction! I have had enough of your moods, Geralt! Regis was expelled, even though he saved your lives, but that's your business. But Cahir saved my life.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The day broke with a red sun, which shone blindingly off of the water lily covered lakes; they turned towards the spot where one of the many branches of the Ina flowed into the Yaruga. The now rode through the dark gloomy forests, where the trees grew directly from the duckweed from the green marshes. Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"So now you trail behind me, hoping that I will lead you to her again. So you can put your claws in her and take her back to your Emperor and hope that he forgives you and doesn't send you to the gallows.' Cahir remained silent. Geralt felt bad. Very bad. 'Because of you she would wake screaming in the night.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'My cotton candy,' cried the girl, looking at the candy lying in the sand. 'I dropped my cotton candy...' Mistle hugged her. 'I'll buy you another.' *** The Geralt was sitting on the sand among the reeds, sullen, angry and pensive. He watched the cormorants sitting withered in a tree. Cahir, after the talk, disappeared into the bushes and did not come back.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Can you, Nilf... Cahir?' 'I can.' 'Let's get to work. Damn it, Geralt, how long are you going to sit there pretending to be offended? Peel the vegetables!' The Geralt got up obediently and moved closer, but sat conspicuously far from Cahir. Before he could complain that he didn't have a knife, the Nilfgaardian – or the Vicorvarian, gave him his own, drawing a second one from his boot.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'Now throw away the slops, Cahir,' Dandelion ordered. 'It smells good, yum, yum. There is no need for more wood, Geralt! What are you doing with that spoon? I doesn't need more stirring!' 'Don't shout.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is. It is difficult to speak of initiative when you have no idea what direction to go.' 'What shall we do then?' Milva pouted. 'The Geralt insists we move south...' 'For him,' Regis smiled, 'the cardinal points have no meaning. He does not care which way we move, so long as he is not sitting doing nothing. This is the purpose of a Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"He may even draw a valid conclusion. That the only activity that a man does alone is masturbation.' Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach remained tactfully silent. 'Let the plague take you all,' the Geralt said finally waving a spoon indignantly. 'May the devil take you, you idiots cooperating in your groups united by a common goal, which none of you understand. And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head. 'Comrades in arms! A team of heroes!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'No. In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Milva heated water in a pot hung over the fire and used the steam to straighten the fletching on her arrows that were wrinkled. Cahir was repairing a broken boot buckle. Geralt was carving a stick. And Regis ran his eyes over each of them in order. 'Well, well,' He said finally.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'Well, well,' He said finally. 'I see that this is inevitable. It seems that I should have explained some things to you a long time ago...' 'Nobody is forcing you,' Geralt threw a long and carefully carved piece of wood into the fire and raised his head. 'I do not need your explanations. I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt. 'He doesn't. You do not need to confide or to explain.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"But when the wind stirs the fear, the crow will react by fleeing.' 'The behaviour of the crow explains the struggle for life.' Cahir pointed out from the darkness. 'The crow is smart,' Milva snorted. 'It is not afraid of a straw man, but real men, because men throw stones and shoot arrows.' 'Self-preservation,' said Geralt, 'is inherent in all living things, crows and people. Thank you for the explanation, Regis, we accept them completely. But don't go digging into the depths of the human subconscious.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"I doubt it. And some people become dizzy and faint just at the sight of blood. In some communities for a few days a month, women are considered unclear and isolated...' 'I think among the barbarians,' Cahir interrupted, 'And fainting at the sight of blood, is probably only among you Nordlings.' 'We have strayed,' the Geralt raised his head, 'we are deviating from the straight path into the thicket of dubious philosophy. Do you think, Regis that people would react differently if they knew that you were treating them, not as prey, but as a pub? Where do you see irrational fears?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"We used the metaphor – I'm going to bed sick.' 'What?' 'There are grounds to think that sunlight is deadly in the long run. There are theories that in about five thousand years, counting modestly, this world will only be inhabited by nocturnal creatures.' 'I'm glad, that I will not live to see it,' Cahir sighed, and then yawned heavily. 'I don't know about you, but these conversations about daily activities remind me that I need to sleep.' 'Me too,' the Geralt stretched. 'The murderous sun will be rising in a few hours. But before then we need sleep...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Last but equally important. It is a myth which you have dictated your sexual phobias.' Cahir snorted softly. 'I have left this myth until the end,' Regis measured him with his eyes, 'and I myself, would tactfully not have touched on it had Geralt not challenged me, so I won't spare you. In Humans the strongest cause of anxiety is sexual. The virgin fainting in the embrace of the bloodsucking vampire, or the youngster exposed to the insolent mouth of the vampire, wandering over their naked body.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Someone is trying to block the trails, I think.' 'It is not impossible,' Regis admitted, 'that the Temerian army is hunting for Squirrels here. But I think there are too many soldiers around here. I suspect that the Nilfgaardians have finally crossed the Yaruga.' 'That's what I suspect,' the Geralt grimaced slightly, looking at Cahir's stony face. 'The corpses we saw this morning, showed signs of the Nilfgaardian method of warfare.' 'Some others are no better.' Milva growled, coming to the young Nilfgaardians defence. 'And do not look askance at Cahir, for both of you share the same fate.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'The girl is pregnant.' Cahir nodded as a sign that he had guessed. Dandelion was dumbfounded. Geralt bit his lip. 'In which month?' 'She refused, fairly impolitely, to give me a date, including the date of her last menstrual cycle. But I know this.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"A clean bed.' 'I understand,' Regis nodded. 'One vote in favour. And you, Geralt?' 'What about me?' 'My lords,' the vampire fixed them with his dark eyes. 'Do not pretend you do not understand.' 'In Nilfgaard,' Cahir said, blushing and lowering his head, 'such matters are determined solely by the woman. Nobody has the right to influence her decision.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'I think so.' 'Aha,' the troubadour nodded. 'Aha. Geralt understands, Cahir think he understands. And when I ask for an explanation you first order me to shut up, and then I get told there is no need to understand. Thank you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"And then in the air, arrows whistled. Some of them stuck into the side of the ferry, some flew higher and splashed into the water. Two flew straight at Dandelion, but the Geralt already with his sword in hand, jumped and with two quick blows, deflected the arrows. 'By the Great Sun,' Cahir gasped. 'He deflected them...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river. The soldiers on the bank again raised a roar, and laid their hands on their bows, arrows began to whistle through the air and one of the horses whinnied wildly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"It seemed like they would succeed, when suddenly Milva let go of her spar and without a word pointed at the right bank. 'This time...' Cahir said, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'This time, it is Nilfgaard.' Geralt also saw it. The riders, who had appeared on the right bank, wore black and green cloaks, the horses wore distinctive harnesses. There were at least a hundred.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Get further from the shore.' Again, this proved to be a difficult task. The current by the right bank was strong and pushing the ferry straight towards a high embankment, they could already hear the cries of the Nilfgaardians. When after a few moments of straining with the spar, Geralt looked up and saw pine boughs over his head. An arrow shot from the top of the cliffs, struck on the deck of the barge only two feet away from him. Another was heading straight for Cahir, which the Geralt deflected with a slash of his sword.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Another was heading straight for Cahir, which the Geralt deflected with a slash of his sword. Milva, Cahir, the ferryman and his assistant, no longer pushed from the bottom, but from the shore and the slope. Geralt threw down his sword and sized a spar to help them, and the ferry began to drift back towards the center of the river. But it was still dangerously close to the right banks and on the bank the Nilfgaardians started a galloping chase. Before they had time to get away they sailed around the ends of the cliffs.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The air began to howl with the sounds of feathered arrows. 'Take cover!' The ferryman's assistant suddenly coughed in an odd way and dropped his spar into the water. Geralt saw the arrowhead and four inches of the shaft protruding from his back. Cahir's chestnut reared on two legs and whinnied with pain, snorted and shook its neck that was pierced by an arrow, it knocked down Dandelion and jumped overboard. The other horses also whinnied and reared; the barge was shaking and pounding with hooves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The bolt went through him from side to side. Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle. However, the actual slaughter the hail of bolts cause was among the horses.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'We will need to carry her,' he said. 'It is our only chance...' 'Not our only,' Cahir said. 'Geralt, to the bridge.' 'Why?' 'Let's halt the flight. If the Nordlings can hold the right side of the bridge, we can get Milva to the left bank.' 'How do we stop them fleeing?' 'I have led soldiers before. Climb the pillar onto the bridge!' Once on the bridge Cahir showed that he indeed had experience in controlling panic among the troops.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Stand your ground, you fucking scoundrels!' Some of those fleeing – far from all – stopped at the terrifying roars and the sight of Cahir waving his bright sword. Others tried to sneak behind his back. But Geralt also drew his sword and joined the show. 'Where are you going?' he cried, clutching a soldier and throwing him back in place. 'Where are you going?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Cahir cursed. In Nilfgaardian. But no one realised except the Geralt. 'What you started, you need to finish,' Geralt growled, clutching his sword in his hand. 'Let's go to them!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The sleeves of the Nilfgaardians had silver embroidery depicting a scorpion. Cahir slashed two with swift strokes of his long sword. Geralt also struck two with Sihil. Then he jumped onto the railing of the bridge, running along it and attacking another. He was a Geralt, maintaining his balance was for him a trifle, but the acrobatic feat amazed and surprised the Nilfgaardian attackers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"And so it was that those who had recently been deserting in panic, rushed over the Nilfgaardians like ravenous wolves, cutting with swords, axes, stabbing with spears and bludgeoning with clubs and halberds. The railings on both sides of the bridge cracked, the horses flew into the river along with their riders on their black cloaks. The uproarious army pushed onto the opposite shore, howling and pushing Geralt and Cahir, the accidental commanders, not letting them do what they wanted to do. Which was to withdraw stealthily, back to Milva and move her to the left bank. The battle raged on.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"The situation was saved by Cahir. Having experience with war, he led his troops around the barricade. They had separated from Geralt's group, but now returned. He had won a horse with black trapping and swung his sword around him, striking the flank. Behind him, yelling fanatically came, halberdiers and spearmen in doublets with red diamonds.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'Forward, by the gods! Cahir! To me!' 'Geralt!' Cahir pulled another Nilfgaardian from his saddle. 'To the bridge! Protect the bridge!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"'Cahir!' he cried in amazement. 'Cahir aep Ceallach!' 'Morteisen...' Cahir, stretched on the ground, said in a voice no less astonished. A dwarvern mercenary, who ran alongside Geralt, dressing in a doublet that was burned and charred, lost no time in amazement at all. With a flourish he thrust his spear into the belly of the Nilfgaardian, pushing the pole in far then yanked it out. Another came and pressed his heavy boot onto the breastplate of the fallen and stabbed a spear into his throat.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Cahir
"Or, woman, my apologies good lady! Hello, I am Zoltan Chivay. I'm Geralt,  the Geralt introduced himself after a moment's hesitation. The one who sang is Dandelion. And this is Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"He knows what he's talking about,  muttered Milva. Where are you going? South,  Geralt said immediately. I would not recommend it. Zoltan Chivay shook his head again.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"As you can see, they are already before us, and to the North, they head for Brugge. Therefore, the only reasonable direction to flee is the East. Milva gave a knowing look to the Geralt, who refrained from commenting. We are just going to the East,  continued Zoltan Chivay. The only chance is to hide behind the front, and the Temerian army will be coming from the East, from the river Ina.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"In an instant, all of the luggage was piled in. After some thought, Zoltan Chivay ordered that there be room left for the children to sit. The command was carried out with hesitation – Geralt noticed that the refugees kept their distance from the dwarves and were reluctant to give up the children. Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The women also did not seem very keen to leave the company. This made it all the more strange that they behaved towards the dwarves with reserve and a certain dislike, mingled with fear, they hardly spoke at rest stops and stood on the sidelines. Geralt attributed the behavior of the women to the tragedy they had recently survived, but he suspected that the reason for their reserve could be the fairly liberal manners of the dwarves. Zoltan and his company swore obscenely and often and the parrot, Field Marshal Duda, had an even richer repertoire. They sang bawdy songs, valiantly supported by Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"When they returned in the morning, they had two sacks, both full. One was filled with horse feed, the second was filled with groats, flour, dried beef, a wheel of cheese that had barely been touched, and even a huge Kindziuk, a delicacy consisting of a casing stuffed with beef offal, pressed between two tablets in the shape of bellows to stoke the fire. Geralt could guess where the bounty had come from. He did not comment immediately, but waited for a suitable moment. Once he was alone with Zoltan, he asked him politely if he did not see anything wrong with robbing other refugees, no less hungry than them, and fighting for survival.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"I decided therefore to take solid action, so it does not go in vain. I'm good for myself and my immediate entourage. Geralt did not ask any more questions. *** During one of their stops, Geralt and Milva chatted longer with Zoltan Chivay, the incorrigible and compulsive altruist. The dwarf was well informed about the course of the war or at least he gave that impression.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Figgis Merluzzo and Munro Bruys went in search of mushrooms. Zoltan, Yazon Yarda, Caleb Stratton and Percival Schuttenbach sprawled not far from the cart and played 'Screwed', their favourite card game, to which they devoted every free moment, even on wet evenings. The Geralt sometimes sat and played with them and encouraged them, as he did now. He still could not understand the complicated rules of the game, but he was fascinated by the cards themselves, which were beautifully and meticulously painted. Compared to human playing cards, these were true masterpieces of printing.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The king wearing a crown was truly royal, the Lady was beautiful and seductive, and the Jack, armed with a halberd, was rakishly moustached. In the dwarven tongue, these figures were called Hraval, Vaina and Ballet, but when Zoltan and his company played, they used the names common to humans. The sun shone, the moisture evaporated from the forest, Geralt encouraged the players. The basic principle of Screwed was something resembling a horse auction at market, such was the intensity and tension in the voice of the player. The pair presenting the highest  price  tried to get as many folds as possible, while the second pair tried to prevent it in every way.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Eh, I would take this the club and ... Before Zoltan had a chance to pick up his club, a shrill scream came from the forest. Geralt jumped up first. He cursed as he ran, because once again he felt the pain through his knee. Just behind him rushed Zoltan Chivay, seizing his sword wrapped in its skins on the cart.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The child that had screamed, was a freckled girl with pigtails, maybe eight or nine years old. She was rooted to the spot a few steps in front of a pile of rotting tree trunks. Geralt jumped up quickly, grabbed her under the arm, interrupting her wild screech, and from the corner of his eye he spotted the movement between the logs. He retreated quickly, bumping into Zoltan and his dwarves. Milva, who also saw the movement among the stumps, stretched her bow.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"It barely moved. It polished the ends of its legs, lifting them one by one and carefully inspecting them, displaying its impressive, sharp mandibles. There was so much screaming,  said Zoltan without any emotion, who was standing next to the Geralt. That I thought it was something really terrible. For example, the Verden cavalry, or the angi'vare.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Will you use your own sword or would you prefer my sihill? Nice sword. Geralt glanced at the sword, which Zoltan drew from its laquered scabbard and deer skins. But I will not need it. Curious,  Zoltan repeated.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Hey, women, get dressed and round up the children! Come on, get moving! When they stopped for the night, Geralt decided to finally clarify some things that had been bothering him. Zoltan Chivay did not seem as if he intended on playing a round of cards, so the Geralt found no problem in drawing him to a secluded place for a man to man chat. He began without beating about the bush.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Do not torment yourself. Forget separating from us. Zoltan resumed his monologue, not embarrassed by the silence of the Geralt. Give up on your long and lonely journey to the South, through Brugge and Sodden to the Yaruga. You have to look for another way to Nilfgaard.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"You have to look for another way to Nilfgaard. If you want I will counsel you... No need,  Geralt rubbed his knee, which after a few days the pain had still not abandoned. Keep your advice, Zoltan. He found Dandelion playing cards with the cheering dwarves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"She's not the only one,  she whispered. So he could not hear. *** At the next stop, the Geralt showed interest in Zoltan's sword, the sihill, which he had taken a brief look at during the affair with the okoglow. Without hesitation, the dwarf stripped the weapon of its deer skins and removed it from its sheath. The sword measured about forty inches, and weighed no more than thirty five ounces.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"And I don't deny that,  Zoltan shrugged. Because inevitably it came from our forge. You Geralts, know how to brandish your swords, but do not make them. They are only made in Mahakam, beneath Mount Carbon. Dwarves temper the steel,  added Percival,  And forge the main layers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"You would have cut it to pieces without much effort. The talk of swords and metallurgy continued for some time. Geralt listened with interest, shared his own experiences, and took the opportunity to enrich his knowledge asking about this and that, examining and testing Zoltan's sihill. He did not know that the very next day he would have to demonstrate the theory with practice. The first sign that people lived in the area, was a very regular stack of bark chips, which Percival Schuttenbach had spotted by the road while he was at the front of the group.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Muttered Zoltan Chivay. If you go there, you will be contaminated with plague ... with the devil, Geralt! Putting us all in danger ... Damn it, this is not the girl you are looking for!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Milva said, looking meaningfully at Geralt. Are you certain that this Cahir is your enemy? The Geralt did not answer. He handed Zoltan his sword. Thanks.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"What is there to be grateful for? Yes. The Geralt said. What is there? The marauder's horses,  Zoltan did not lower his eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'All your big cities,' complained the dwarf between the loud rasping of his parrot, 'are built on ours and the elves foundations. The smaller towns and castles you have built yourselves, but you continue to take our stones. All this time, it was thanks to us non-humans for your development and progress.' Geralt said nothing. 'But you destroy even this.' Zoltan cursed, shaking his head and helped move the cart around another of the holes. 'Why are you not removing the stones gradually from the ends of the road?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'Why are you not removing the stones gradually from the ends of the road? You are like children! Instead of eating the whole donut, as is right and proper, you just lick the jam from the inside and discard the rest, because it was not as tasty.' Geralt explained that this was the fault of political geography. The western end of the old road was located in Brugge, the eastern in Temeria and the middle in Sodden, every kingdom devastated their part as they needed it. In response, Zoltan obscenely described a place where they could remove the kings and their politics.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Its green saddle had the embroidery of Nilfgaard and was covered in dark blood stains. It was impossible to know whether it was the blood of the slain rider or whether it was shed later when the horse had a new owner. 'Well the problem is ended.' Milva said, looking at Geralt. 'If there was a problem.' 'The real problem is that we do not know who the rider was, who was thrown from the saddle.' Zoltan murmured. 'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"And hanging from an oak, too.' Zoltan waved his hand and walked to the tree. Dandelion who could not resist his curiosity, spurred on Pegasus, and went after the dwarf. Geralt, after a moment's reflection, followed them. Milva trailed after him. The crows that were feeding on the corpses reluctantly rose into the air, squawking and rustling their feathers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"I remember what happened in Upper Sodden during the previous war. I believe we should continue through the forest. The forest will be safer.' 'I wouldn't be so sure.' Geralt said pointing at the last hanged man, who, although hung high, his calf was torn to shreds and in place of his feet, there were only stumps with bones sticking out. 'Look. A ghoul did that.' 'Monsters?' Zoltan Chivay stopped and spat.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"And do not forget where you hid everything!' 'Rest assured.' 'Catch up to us when you can.' Zoltan tucked his hatchet into his belt and threw his backpack over his shoulder along with Sihil. 'We are crossing over O, then along the Chotla to Ina. Farewell.' 'Interesting.' Milva muttered to Geralt, when their weakened squad departed on the road, waving farewell to the four dwarves left behind. 'I wonder what was in those boxes, that they needed to bury them and mark the place. And so that none of us saw.' 'It's not our business.' 'I don't think,' Dandelion said softly while carefully guiding Pegasus among the fallen trunks, 'that the boxes contained clean underwear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give... What is that shining in the south? A kind of glow?' 'You know that glow,' Geralt said. 'Again, someone had lit thatched roofs over somebody's head. You know what, Zoltan?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'I saved it for just this occasion. It cost me five crowns in the bazaar. Can such a thing kill a ghoul, Geralt?' 'I don't think there are ghouls.' 'You said so yourself,' Zoltan snapped. 'That the hanged man on the oak was eaten by ghouls. And we are in a cemetery now, where there are ghouls.' 'Not always.' 'I'll hold you to your word.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"As they approached the dolmen, they split up, making it impossible for the ghoul to escape. But their strategy was futile. Geralt knew this would happen: his medallion had not wavered at all. 'There is no one,' Zoltan said, looking around. 'Not a soul.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'I know you are in there. Hurry up, otherwise I'll stab my sword through the hole.' From a perfectly camouflaged pit under the dolmen came a quiet scratching. 'Come out,' repeated Geralt. 'I won't hurt you.' 'Not one hair on your head will fall,' Zoltan assured in a sweet voice, but with a bloodthirsty look in his eyes, as he reached over his shoulder to grab Sihil. 'There is nothing to worry about.' Geralt shook his head and with a determined gesture order him back.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'So you live here, Mister Regis.' He drawled. 'And during the night walk among the graves. Are you not afraid?' 'Why would I be afraid?' 'This gentleman here,' Zoltan pointed to Geralt, 'is a Geralt. He saw signs of ghouls. Walking corpses, do you understand?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'A slayer of monsters. Well that is interesting. Explain to your companions, Sir Geralt, that this necropolis is over a half a millennium old. As for food, ghouls aren't picky, but after five hundred years of chewing on old bones, they have left.' 'That is one less worry.' Zoltan said, looking around. 'Well, Sir Surgeon let me invite you back to our camp.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Come on, we'll introduce you to the rest of our company.' As they approached the camp, the horses snorted and beat the ground with their hooves. 'Stand a little upwind, Mister Regis.' Zoltan threw the medic a meaningful look. 'The smell of sage frightens the mounts, and to me, I'm ashamed to admit it, I associate it with pulling teeth.' *** 'Geralt,' murmured Zoltan as Emiel Regis disappeared behind a hanging curtain, which substituted as a door for his cabin. 'Let's keep our eyes open. I do not like this smelly herbalist.' 'Any particular reason?' 'I'm suspicious of people who spend their summers near cemeteries.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Such practices are done on fresh corpses. This cemetery is extremely old.' 'Yeah,' the dwarf scratch his beard thoughtfully, and watched the Kernow women prepare to spend their night under cherry bushes growing around the cabin of the medic. 'Could it be he is stealing the valuables hidden in the tombs?' 'Ask him.' Geralt shrugged. 'You accepted his invitation extending his home to us, without affections, and now, suddenly, you have become as suspicious as an old maid given a compliment.' 'Hmm,' Zoltan thought. 'You have a point.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest. 'Are you deaf? The moonshine is made of mandrake.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'There is no need to fear. The mandrake is correctly cured, and the proportions are carefully selected and accurately weighed. For one pound of yeast I get five ounces of Alraune and only half an ounce of belladonna...' 'It is not about that.' Zoltan looked at the Geralt, he understood the point, he turned serious and carefully backed away from the stove. 'It is not that, Mister Regis, but about how much the Alraune costs. It is too expensive a drink for us.' 'Mandragora.' Dandelion whispered admiringly, pointing to the towering pile in a corner booth resembling small bulbs of sugar beets.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"True mandrake?' 'The female variety,' said the alchemist. 'I find it in abundance in the cemetery, where we met. Which is precisely why I spend my summers here.' The Geralt looked meaningfully at Zoltan. The dwarf winked. Regis cracked a half smile.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'It is easy to fall into mannerisms and start using those words every day. The people around them then consider them a pompous fool.' 'Or by an alchemist.' Said Zoltan, pouring another cup. 'Or by a Geralt,' snorted Dandelion, 'who has been reading, in order to impress a certain sorceress. The sorceresses, gentlemen, do not go crazy for convoluted far-fetched tales. Am I right, Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Come on, tell us...' 'Skip a few rounds, Dandelion,' interrupted the Geralt coldly. 'Some of the alkaloids have started to act too quickly on you. You talk too much.' 'I might end up with those secrets of yours, Geralt.' Zoltan frowned 'Dandelion has told us nothing new. You can't avoid being a walking legend. The stories of your adventures are played in puppet theaters.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"I want to drink more.' 'Milva?' 'What?' 'You never told me why you decided to come with me.' 'You never asked.' 'I'm asking now.' 'It is too late. Now I don't even know.' *** 'Well finally, you're back.' Zoltan greeted them cheerfully. 'Now we are all here, imagine this, Regis has decided to journey with us.' 'Really?' Geralt looked at the alchemist. 'Why the sudden decision?' 'Zoltan,' Regis lowered his eyes, 'made me realize that the war that sweeps around me is much more serious than the stories I have heard from the refugees. Returning to Dillingen is off the table and hiding in the wilderness doesn't seem wise.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Milva frowned. Zoltan, forgetting that he already told everyone about the old fart, Hogg the Mahakam thane, started again. Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened. Regis also listened and even added comments, completely calm about being the only sober one among those present. Dandelion strummed his lute and sang.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"useful.' 'For what?' 'For drills and files. For bearings. I had a whole pile...' 'Do you hear that, Geralt?' Zoltan waved his arms in the air, almost knocking himself over on his back. 'He dreams of a heap of diamonds. Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"A terrible, deep, dark secret... No one can know about this, understand? Nobody!' 'I have not heard anything,' Zoltan said, looking boldly at the Geralt. 'It seems I have an earwig in my ear.' 'These earwigs are a real pest,' said Regis, pretending to poke in his ear. 'We travel to Nilfgaard...' Dandelion rested on the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"He can remember his name and what happened. This is a good sign. The lively emotions of Lady Milva did not, fortunately, have consequences.' The Geralt looked at the archer, who was sitting next to them on rock, her eyes lost in the distance. 'She isn't a delicate lady susceptible to such emotions,' he muttered. 'I would blame the residue of the belladonna from yesterday.' 'She has vomited before.' Zoltan interjected quietly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"They are calmer. Come on, it is time to be on our way.' *** The enlarged company now resembled a funeral procession, and move at the same rate. 'What do you think of their vampire?' Zoltan Chivay asked the Geralt. 'Do you believe their story?' 'I have not seen the victims. I can not say anything in advance.' 'It is obviously nonsense,' Dandelion said with conviction.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"There was no vampire. But there was a good cook.' 'No doubt there were those cases. However, where the vampire rumour was justified,' Regis said, without looking at the Geralt. 'Then, I imagine, the time and energy was not used in vain. The monster died from your sword?' 'Sometimes.' 'Either way,' said Zoltan, 'the peasants are in luck.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"She is also like a child, and says no ma, no pa. But I do not understand those things. The priest, and everyone, is saying that he did all kinds of witchcraft.' 'Everyone but the accused,' Regis said quietly, walking next to the Geralt. 'I suppose when she was asked she said no ma, no pa.' There was no more time to make specific inquiries. They passed through the crowd although not without the help of Zoltan and his ash stick.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"A challenge to a duel? Anyone can clearly see you are a scoundrel and a bully! With your sword, you want to pass the judgement of God?' 'If you do not like the sword,' said Zoltan, coming to stand next to Geralt, 'and if this fellow does not fit you, maybe I will be worthy? Come on let those who accuse the girl beat me with the axe.' 'Or me with the bow.' said Milva, squinting, also emerging from the crowd. 'One arrow at a hundred paces.' 'You see, people, how quickly they multiply to defend the witch?' shouted the priest, then turned and twisted his face into a sly smile.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"But if the judgement of God shows something else, then you die with her! I have spoken!' The murmurs of displeasure from Mayor Laabs and his group were drowned out by the shouts of those gathered by the priest, anticipating a great show and rejoicing. Milva looked at Zoltan, Zoltan the Geralt, the Geralt at the sky, and then at Milva. 'Do you believe in gods?' He asked in a low voice. 'I believe,' said the archer quietly, staring intently at the embers in the fire.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'Please refrain from praying.' The surgeon approached the fire, respectfully bowed to the priest and to the audience and then without the slightest hesitation, reached his hand into the burning coals. The crowd gasped in unison, Zoltan cursed. Milva grasped Geralt's arm. Regis straightened up, looked calmly at the horseshoe in his hand and without hurrying, approached the priest. The priest stepped back, but crashed into the peasants who were behind him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him. He did not have time to reflect on this unusual phenomenon as one of the soldiers hit him with a spear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The guards standing next to the shed chatted idly, laughing and occasionally cleared their throats and spat for long periods. The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"However, above the excited voices of the players was a well known hoarse croak. 'Rrrraaaa... motherfuckers!' 'Greetings, boys,' Geralt said as he came out from behind a pile of logs. 'I'm glad to see you alive and healthy. Even with the parrot.' 'Damn it!' Zoltan Chivay dropped his cards in surprise, after which he jumped to his feet so suddenly that Field Marshal Duda, who was on his shoulder, flapped his wings and shrieked with terror.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Her head fell slightly onto her chest. She did not even flinch when Regis carefully peeled off the dirty rags and rubbed her scorched arm with a strangely scented ointment. Geralt turned his head and looked at the two women with the two children and then at the dwarf. Zoltan grunted. 'The women,' he explained in an undertone, 'we found wandering here in the Angren.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'The women,' he explained in an undertone, 'we found wandering here in the Angren. They were lost during their flight, they were alone, frightened and hungry, so we offered to accompany them. It just came out.' 'It just came out,' Geralt repeated, smiling slightly. 'You are an incorrigible altruist, Zoltan Chivay.' 'Every person is defective. You, you're still looking to rush to a girl's rescue.' 'I still do.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Just be caring and care for her... Thank you for your help, Surgeon. I see that you have also joined the company of the Geralt.' 'It just came out.' 'Hmmm,' Zoltan stroked his beard. 'So then, what are your plans to find Ciri?' 'We are headed to the east, to Caed Dhu, to the Druid Circle. We hope the druids will help...' 'There is no help,' the girl sitting next to the piles of logs with a bandaged arm spoke in a loud and metallic voice.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The fire purifies. But also kills.' Regis firmly grabbed the stunned Zoltan by the arm, and with a gesture ordered him to silence. Geralt, who knew about hypnotic trances, was silent and did not move. 'He who spills blood, and he who drank blood,' said the girl, without raising her head, 'will pay with blood. Three days will pass and one will die in the second, and then something will die in each.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The girl shook her head and screamed wildly. When she raised her eyes there was indeed nothing in them but mist. *** Zoltan, Geralt remembered, still running his fingers over the blade covered in runes, after this event acquired a new respect for Regis, he abandoned the familiar tone with which he used to address the surgeon. Under the request of Regis, they did not say a word about the strange event to the rest. The Geralt was not greatly affected by the event.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"The Geralt was not greatly affected by the event. He had seen similar trances and sometimes it was said that the talk of the hypnotized was not prophetic, but a simple repetition of one's thoughts and subconscious suggestions of the hypnotist. Admittedly, in this case it was not hypnosis, but the vampire's spell, and Geralt wondered what the girl would have drawn out of Regis's mind had the trance lasted longer. *** For half a day they walked along with the dwarves and their protégés. Zoltan Chivay then stopped walking and took the Geralt aside.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Zoltan Chivay then stopped walking and took the Geralt aside. 'We must separate,' he said. 'We have already made our decision, Geralt. To the north is Mahakam, the valley leads directly to the mountains. Enough adventure.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Beneath Mount Carbon.' 'I understand.' 'I'm glad that you understand. I wish you luck, you and your company. A strange company, I dare to observe.' 'They want to help me,' the Geralt said quietly. 'It is something new for me. So I have decided not to investigate their motives.' 'Wise,' Zoltan said as he removed from his back Sihil in its sheath, wrapped in goatskin.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"There is no disgrace. And when you find the ones who wronged your Ciri, give them one for Caleb Stratton. And remember Zoltan Chivay and the dwarven forges.' 'You can be assured,' Geralt took the sword and buckled it across his back. 'You can be assured that I well remember. In this lousy world, Zoltan, goodness, honesty and integrity are very memorable.' 'You're right,' the dwarf squinted his eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"A thief's loot, on which we planned to build our futures.' 'Why are you telling me this Zoltan?' 'Because to you, I have the feeling, appearances are not deceiving if played for too long. What you took to be good and noble proved to be vile and dishonest under a pretty normal mask. It is easy to deceive, Geralt, because you do not ask for motives. But I will not deceive you. And do not look to the women and children; do not take the dwarf that stands before you to be honest and noble.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"Before you is a thief, a criminal and perhaps a murderer. Because I do not rule out the merchant we left in a ditch by the side of the road in Dillingen.' They were silent for a long time, looking to the distant mountains covered in clouds to the north. 'Goodbye, Zoltan, 'Geralt said finally. 'It may be that the forces of whose existence I am slowly ceasing to doubt will still allow us to meet again. I wish it is so.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"A thief and a bandit?' 'Without hesitation. Because I am no longer as easily fooled as I used to be. While I don't question motives, I am slowly learning the art of looking beneath the masks.' *** Geralt waved Sihil across the path of a passing moth. After parting with Zoltan and his group, the Geralt recalled, we found a group of peasants wandering in the woods. Some fled at the sight of us, but Milva stopped a few, threatening them with her bow.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Zoltan
"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning. Geralt know that that there were three of them, so he listened, but the third soldier issued no sound. He waited with bated breath.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'The catfish chase the salmon. But there is no sign of the Geralt or Dandelion. Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion. 'Pah... I wonder...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror. 'Farewell and good luck.' 'Goodbye, Regis. Same to you.' Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy snapped his cloak, wrapped it around himself and disappeared.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Your friends are waiting there with a noose!' 'Don't shout.' 'So don't stand there like a post. Help me get Dandelion on the gelding.' 'You saved our horses? Roach as well?' 'He saved them,' she nodded at Cahir. 'We're going.' *** They crossed over the Ina. They rode along the right bank, alongside the river, through shallow backwaters and old river beds overrun with willows, through meadows and wetlands reverberating with the croaking of frogs, the cries of invisible ducks and cicadas.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"The day broke with a red sun, which shone blindingly off of the water lily covered lakes; they turned towards the spot where one of the many branches of the Ina flowed into the Yaruga. The now rode through the dark gloomy forests, where the trees grew directly from the duckweed from the green marshes. Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'I'll buy you another.' *** The Geralt was sitting on the sand among the reeds, sullen, angry and pensive. He watched the cormorants sitting withered in a tree. Cahir, after the talk, disappeared into the bushes and did not come back. Milva and Dandelion were looking for something to eat. Inside the boat they had found under the seats a copper saucepan and a basket of vegetables.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Dandelion and the vampire had efficiently cleaned the fish. 'This will be a thin soup,' Dandelion said, hanging the cauldron over the fire. 'We could use some bigger fish.' 'Would this serve?' Cahir appeared from among the reeds, holding a three pound pike still waving its tail and its gills opening and closing. 'Aha! What a beauty!",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"The cauldron, full of little fish and vegetables started to boil. The vampire stirred it with a spoon that Milva had carved from wood. Once Cahir had cleaned and divided the pike, Dandelion through the tail and head into the cauldron and stirred thoroughly. 'Yum, yum, it smells good. When everything is cooked lets strain the remains.' 'Unless you use your socks,' Milva raised her eyebrows, while carving another spoon, 'we don't have a strainer.' 'My dear, Milva,' Regis smiled.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'What remains in the armor we can then discard.' 'Make sure you wash it first,' Milva said. 'Otherwise, I won't eat this soup.' The filtration went smoothly. 'Now throw away the slops, Cahir,' Dandelion ordered. 'It smells good, yum, yum. There is no need for more wood, Geralt!",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'Look at him, you've offended him again.' 'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan. If he doesn't know what to do he just talks and sulks. Have you noticed that yet?' 'Long ago.' Cahir said quietly. 'Add pepper.' Dandelion said licking the spoon and chewing. 'And salt.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'Ignore him. He was just lucky, I was with him when he was quarrelling with Yennefer, a pale beauty with raven hair.' 'Be more discreet,' the vampire reminded him. 'And do not forget, he has problems.' 'Problems,' Cahir stifled a belch, 'must be addressed.' 'True,' Dandelion said. 'But how?' Milva snorted and stretched out to make herself more comfortable on the warm sand. 'The vampire is a scholar.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'Let the plague take you all,' the Geralt said finally waving a spoon indignantly. 'May the devil take you, you idiots cooperating in your groups united by a common goal, which none of you understand. And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'No. In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"It seems that I should have explained some things to you a long time ago...' 'Nobody is forcing you,' Geralt threw a long and carefully carved piece of wood into the fire and raised his head. 'I do not need your explanations. I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"*** Since dawn they had not seen or heard any troops. Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Ethain asked the druid, when, according to the druid, will this terrible time of hunger come, and the druid replied, not for two thousand years, according to their forecasts. The king dismissed him and politely asked him to come through here in a few thousand years and then he would think about it. The druid did not understand the joke and began to object, so they threw him out of town.' 'All druids are alike,' confirmed Cahir. 'We, the Nilfgaardians...' 'I gotcha!' Dandelion cried triumphantly. 'We, the Nilfgaardians!",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"It seems that he was right.' Dandelion snorted loudly, and meaningfully, looking at both the vampire and the Nilfgaardian. 'The many parts of my name,' Regis said, looking slightly offended, 'are my real name. And they are consistent with vampire tradition.' 'Mine also,' Cahir hastened to explain. 'Mawr is the name of my mother and my grandfather's name was Dyffryn. There is nothing ridiculous about it poet.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Yes, we all knew that Milva vomited at dawn. But sometimes we ate things that had all of our guts churning. Dandelion also vomited once or twice, and once Cahir got diarrhoea, and was terrified that he had caught dysentery. The fact that the girl now and again jumped from her saddle and ran off to the bushes, I took for a bladder infection... How could I have been so stupid?",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Directly, so to speak.' 'Express yourself more clearly, damn it!' snapped Dandelion. 'Team, responsibility...What is wrong with Milva? What is this disease?' 'This is not a disease,' Cahir said quietly. 'At least not in the strict sense of the word,' confirmed Regis. 'The girl is pregnant.' Cahir nodded as a sign that he had guessed.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Not at all, do you understand?' 'No,' Dandelion interjected. 'I do not understand at all. Cahir? Do you understand?' 'Yes' he said slowly. 'I think so.' 'Aha,' the troubadour nodded.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Death! Gods, save us!' 'Hold the horses, Dandelion!' Milva ordered, removing her bow from its case. 'Hold the horses!' 'It is not the imperials,' Cahir said. 'I do not think...' His voice was drowned by the cries of the nearest horse and the screaming ferryman. Spurred on by the shouts, the assistant grabbed an axe, swung and cut at the rope.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"The rope was cut and sank under its weight; the ferry turned slightly and began to sail down the river. The horsemen on the shore raised a terrible roar. 'Dandelion is right,' Cahir said grimly.

"Some of them stuck into the side of the ferry, some flew higher and splashed into the water. Two flew straight at Dandelion, but the Geralt already with his sword in hand, jumped and with two quick blows, deflected the arrows. 'By the Great Sun,' Cahir gasped. 'He deflected them... Two arrows!",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river. The soldiers on the bank again raised a roar, and laid their hands on their bows, arrows began to whistle through the air and one of the horses whinnied wildly.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"'Take cover!' The ferryman's assistant suddenly coughed in an odd way and dropped his spar into the water. Geralt saw the arrowhead and four inches of the shaft protruding from his back. Cahir's chestnut reared on two legs and whinnied with pain, snorted and shook its neck that was pierced by an arrow, it knocked down Dandelion and jumped overboard. The other horses also whinnied and reared; the barge was shaking and pounding with hooves. 'Hold the horses!' shouted the vampire.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Among the people the only one hit was the ferryman, still trying to steer with his spar. The bolt went through him from side to side. Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"She will not be able to walk.' Dandelion swore disgustingly. 'We will need to carry her,' he said. 'It is our only chance...' 'Not our only,' Cahir said. 'Geralt, to the bridge.' 'Why?' 'Let's halt the flight. If the Nordlings can hold the right side of the bridge, we can get Milva to the left bank.' 'How do we stop them fleeing?' 'I have led soldiers before.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Dandelion
"Do I have to tear it from you, along with the corset?' *** The silence that ensued at the table following the speech by Philippa Eilhart was shortly replaced by a cacophony. The sorceresses expressed surprise and disbelief, demanding explanations. Some no doubt knew a lot about this foreseen ruler of the North, Ciri or Ciri another name they were familiar with, but they knew less. Fringilla Vigo knew nothing about the suspicions and speculations, and concentrated mainly on a certain lock of hair. Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent. Philippa Eilhart took the floor again.

I speak mostly of you, Yennefer.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress. And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt. Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl. About her study in the temple of Melitele and Ciri's mysterious abilities.

"'Now, according to the accurate observation of Lady Assire, the resurrected Lara gene goes smoothly through the female line.' 'Yes. This is Pavetta, the daughter of Calanthe. And Pavetta's daughter, Ciri. The only one at this time who is heiress to the Elder Blood, the Lara gene carrier.' 'The only one?' Sile de Tansarville asked sharply. 'You are very sure of yourself, Enid.' 'What do you mean?' Sile rose suddenly, extended her fingers covered with rings in the direction of the fruit platter and levitated the rest of the fruit, destroying and transforming Francesca's whole scheme into a multi-coloured mess.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"Have you forgotten about Vilgefortz, ladies?' 'I have not.' Sabrina's eyes burned for a moment with the fire of hatred. 'I have not forgotten!' 'The time will come for him,' Keira Metz teeth flashed ominously. 'But for now, this is not about him, but about Ciri and the Elder Blood which is so important to us, who is held by Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard.' 'The Emperor,' Assire said quietly, looking at Fringilla, 'has nothing in his hands. The girl being held in Rowan is not a carrier of any extraordinary gene. She is normal to commonplace.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save.

Assire var Anahid leaned towards her friend.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Assire
"It was not Nilfgaard who kidnapped her. If she was kidnapped.' 'How is that?' 'It's a long story.' *** 'By the Great Sun,' Fringilla standing in the threshold, tilted her head in surprise and looked at her friend. 'What have you done with your hair, Assire?' 'I have washed it,' Assire var Anahid replied dryly. 'And curled it. Come in, please, sit down.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"Get out of the chair, Merlin. Shoo!' The sorceress sat in the place the black cat has reluctantly vacated, still staring at her friend's hair. 'Stop staring at me,' Assire's hand touched the fluffy shiny curls. 'I decided to change a bit. Anyway, I followed your example.' 'I,' Fringilla Vigo laughed, 'have always been considered unruly and rebellious.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"Cast the spell, if you must. And then let's move on to discuss the reason I invited you.' Fringilla Vigo stroked the cat that rubbed against her leg, purring and stretching, pretending it was a gesture of affection, not a veiled suggestion that the black-haired sorceress was in it's chair. 'Is it true,' she said, without raising her head, 'that Seneschal Ceallach aep Gryffyd visited you, right?' 'Yes,' Assire confirmed. 'Ceallach visited me, in despair, asking me for help for intercession, with his son, whom Emperor Emhyr has ordered captured, tortured and executed. To whom is a desperate father to turn to, if not a relative?",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"She was afraid that her friend wanted to get involved in the business of Cahir, the son of Ceallach, a matter that smelled of the scaffold. And if she had been asked for help, she would not be able to refuse. 'About mid-July,' she began, 'the entire court of Loc Grim had the opportunity to admire a fifteen year old girl, who was allegedly the princess of Cintra, which, during the audience, Emhyr portrayed as the queen and treated her so graciously, that rumours spread about the imminent marriage.' 'I heard,' Assire stroke the cat, which had become discouraged that Fringilla would not move, considered the possibility of getting into another chair, 'that there is still talk about this undoubtedly political marriage.' 'But in lower voices and less often. Because the Cintran princess has been taken to Darn Rowan. Darn Rowan, as you know, is usually known for housing prisoners.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"Your fairground tricks cost me a fortune and I get no benefit from them. The task that I set for your pitiful academy was completed by a simple astrologer in four days. ' Assire var Anahid snorted with contempt, still stroking the cat. 'I found out easily,' Fringilla continued, 'that the astrologer was none other than the infamous Xarthisius.' 'So the person that was sought, this Cintran, is to be the candidate for empress. And Xarthisius found her.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"Could he have expected Emhyr would spot the fraud at first sight? Because he would realize. Would realize because he was...' 'A lock of hair,' interrupted Assire. 'A lock of hair from a six year old girl. Fringilla, Emhyr has not been looking for this girl for three years, but much longer.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla

"In her turbulent mind the secret deliberations of the Lodge meeting turned into a wild orgy with frantic music, aphrodisiacs and slaves of both sexes and elaborate accessories. The last teleport had left her between two columns of black marble, with dryness in her mouth, the magic winds had left tears in her eyes and her hand clenched tightly her emerald necklace that plunged into her neckline. Next to her Assire var Anahid also appeared to be noticeably nervous. Fringilla, however, had reason to suspect that her friend was confused with her new dress, which was not very typical for her: a simple yet elegant blue colour, complimented by a tiny and modest necklace with alexandrite. The nervousness passed at once.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Fringilla
"Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters.

Riannon, the daughter of Lara Dorren who was raised by Cerro the now wife of Goidemar the king of Temeria, was accidently captured by the rebel Falka and imprisoned in the castle of Houtborg.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Sabrina
"He was not a carrier so we were not interested in him. I believe he died in a war, he only had weapons and fighting on his mind.' 'Wait.' Sabrina said with a rapid motion of her hair. 'Muriel the Rogue Beauty's daughter was Adalia called the Fay...' 'That's right.' confirmed Francesca. 'An interesting person, Adalia. A strong Source, perfect material for a sorceress.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Sabrina
"The latent gene in Fiona was probably in her male descendants up to the third generation. But it has not disappeared and I know why.' 'Bloody hell.' Yennefer hissed through her teeth. 'I'm lost,' said Sabrina Glevissig, 'in the jungle of all this genetic genealogy.' Francesca drew a platter of fruit closer to her, stretched out her hand and muttered a spell. 'I apologize for this fairground show of telekinesis,' she smiled, and ordered a red apple to rise from the table. 'But with the help of this levitating fruit it will be easier for me to clarify everything.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Sabrina
"But I never questioned her abilities.' 'She will tell everything!' Sabrina Glevissig shouted. 'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save.",Baptism of Fire,Francesca,Sabrina
"He also knew that these threads led directly to him. But his immunity protected him, and tradition and duty forced him to play the game until the very end. Especially after the strange coded instructions that Vattier and Stefan Skellen  The Coroner , the imperial agent of special missions, had recently sent to the embassy. As a successor has not yet been appointed,  began Dijkstra,  The unpleasant duty falls to me, of informing you that your Excellency has been considered persona non grata in the kingdom of Redania. The ambassador bowed.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"Surprisingly, we are not the only ones looking for this strange individual, but as it turns out, Vattiera de Rideaux and people of that son of a bitch ...''    Lady Philippa, hem, hem, does not like such words. I wrote:  the scoundrel . Fine, the scoundrel Stefan Skellena. ''And you know as well as I, dear Phil, that the intelligence services of Emhyr are urgently looking for only those agents and emissaries, who vowed to rip Emhyr apart. Those who were meant to do his bidding in the cities or die, but betrayed him, their commands left unexecuted.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"At her command there soon arrived to my commando unit a certain Rience, reportedly a factotum of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, also a sorcerer. In the deepest secrecy a plan of action was developed, aimed at eliminating a number of wizards at the Congress on the island of Thanedd. The plan was presented to me as an action that had the full support of the Emperor Emhyr, Vattier de Rideaux and Stefan Skellen, otherwise I would not have agrees to cooperate with the Dh'oine, sorcerers or not, because I have seen too many provocations in my life. The involvement of the empire in this affair was confirmed at Cape Bremervoord by the arrival of the vessel that brought Cahir, the son of Ceallach, equipped with special powers of attorney and orders. According to these orders I was to appoint a small group of my commandos which was subject only to Cahir.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"And to tell you the truth, I know nothing about the princess of Cintra, neither true nor false. I have told you everything I know. I hope that Lord de Rideaux and Stefan Skellen no longer wish to ambush me. Dh'oine have long tried to capture or kill me, so I have developed the habit of killing all who try. In the future, I will not wait to see if any of the agents are sent by chance on the orders of Vattier or Skellen.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"'Henselt of Kaedwen recently sent me a  consul , Dijkstra came to Dol Blathanna on a  trade mission . And now Vattier de Rideaux head of imperial intelligence himself! Oh, and previously Stefan Skellen prowled around here, the Grand Imperial Nobody. But I did not grant him a hearing. I am the Queen and Skellen is nothing.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"I am the Queen and Skellen is nothing. Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood.",Baptism of Fire,Stefan,Vattier
"Even then, it turned out to be a devilishly strenuous exercise, partly because the distance was so considerable. The clenched eyelids of Philippa Eilhart quivered, Triss Merigold panted, and sweat beads ran down the high forehead of Keira Metz. Only the face of Margarita Laux-Antille expressed no fatigue. The small room plunged into semi-lit darkness, suddenly, a mosaic of light began to dance along the dark wood paneling. Outlined by a white glow, an orb appeared above the round table.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"We must stabilize the projection and greet our guest. Strengthen me, Rita. Margarita Laux-Antille repeated the formula of the incantation and gestured to Philippa. The image flickered several times, it started to lose its vague picture and unnatural glow, the contours and colours became more acute. The sorceresses were now carefully observing the silhouette that was facing them.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"I regret that we meet as teleprojections, however, due to the times and the distances between us, a real meeting would have been impossible. I, Philippa Eilhart, the mistress of this castle, as hostess and instigator of this meeting will handle the introductions. To my right, Margarita Laux-Antille, the head of the Academy of Aretuza. To my left, Triss Merigold, of Maribor, and Keira Metz, of Carreras. Next, we have Sabrina Glevissig, of Ard Carraigh and Sheala Tancarville of Creyden, representing Kovir.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"And you know for certain he does not mean the one that he follows. said Assire var Anahid, looking at Philippa. I am apolitical,  Margarita Laux-Antille raised her head. And my school is apolitical. I mean all political types that exist!",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"'Sile de Tansarville,' she said at last, 'is a secretive recluse, she has no political connections. Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery. Sabrina Glevissig has not surrendered her political influence, which is in Kaedwen, but will not betray the Lodge.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"They pay me for a craft that I love truly and sincerely.' *** Yennefer greeted with relief, joy and hope the break for a snack and the wetting of dry throats, proposed by Philippa. It became immediately clear that her hopes were going to be dashed. Margarita m clearly wished to speak with her, Philippa quickly pulled her to the other end of the hall. Triss Merigold, who approached her was accompanied by Francesca. The elf monitored the conversation without embarrassment.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Philippa
"Next, we have Sabrina Glevissig, of Ard Carraigh and Sheala Tancarville of Creyden, representing Kovir. Then Francesca Findabair, known as Enid an Gleanna, the current ruler of the Valley of Flowers. And finally Assire var Anahid of Vicovaro, from the Empire of Nilfgaard. And now ... And now I will say goodbye!",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery. Sabrina Glevissig has not surrendered her political influence, which is in Kaedwen, but will not betray the Lodge. She draws power, which she gives to the Lodge.' 'And this Assire var Anahid? And this second Nilfgaardian, who will be announced at Montecalvo?' 'I know little about them,' Francesca smiled slightly, 'but as soon as I see them, I will know more. As soon as I see, in what and how they are dressed.' Ida Emean's painted eyes narrowed, but she refrained from asking a question.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable. Sile de Tansarville, a researcher, immediately found a lot of common topics with the researcher Assire var Anahid and Fringilla quickly gained a liking to the cheerful Triss Merigold. The conversations were accompanied by the greed absorption of oysters. Only Sabrina Glevissig refused, being a faithful daughter of Kaedwen's forests, she even expressed her contempt for the  slimy filth  and her desire for a piece of cold venison with prunes.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"And what I don't.' 'In that case it would be best if we start without delay. Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked.

"Death to kings, death to wizards, death to priests, nobles, the rich and lords, soon death to everything that is alive, because there was no way to contain the rebels drunk with blood. The rebellion began to spread to other countries...' 'Nilfgaardian historians have written about it.' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted with distinct irony. 'As Lady Assire and Lady Vigo have undoubtedly read. Shorten it, Francesca. Skip to Riannon and the triplets of Houtborg.' 'All right.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"Have you forgotten about Vilgefortz, ladies?' 'I have not.' Sabrina's eyes burned for a moment with the fire of hatred. 'I have not forgotten!' 'The time will come for him,' Keira Metz teeth flashed ominously. 'But for now, this is not about him, but about Ciri and the Elder Blood which is so important to us, who is held by Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard.' 'The Emperor,' Assire said quietly, looking at Fringilla, 'has nothing in his hands. The girl being held in Rowan is not a carrier of any extraordinary gene. She is normal to commonplace.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"I saw them both, her and Ciri, together. I understand everything.' 'And I don't understand anything!' Sabrina screamed out loud again. Assire var Anahid leaned towards her friend. 'I will not ask why you did it,' she whispered. 'I will not ask you how you did it.",Baptism of Fire,Assire,Sabrina
"Maria Barring. But they call me, Milva.' 'The Geralt is moving in the wrong direction, Milva,' he said after a moment. 'Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. It was not Nilfgaard who kidnapped her. If she was kidnapped.' 'How is that?' 'It's a long story.' *** 'By the Great Sun,' Fringilla standing in the threshold, tilted her head in surprise and looked at her friend.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"Do I have to tear it from you, along with the corset?' *** The silence that ensued at the table following the speech by Philippa Eilhart was shortly replaced by a cacophony. The sorceresses expressed surprise and disbelief, demanding explanations. Some no doubt knew a lot about this foreseen ruler of the North, Ciri or Ciri another name they were familiar with, but they knew less. Fringilla Vigo knew nothing about the suspicions and speculations, and concentrated mainly on a certain lock of hair. Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress. And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt. Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl. About her study in the temple of Melitele and Ciri's mysterious abilities. They listen with stone faces, thought Triss, looking at Assire and Fringilla. Like sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence. And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is. Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face. She was not fooled. A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident. Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"Have you forgotten about Vilgefortz, ladies?' 'I have not.' Sabrina's eyes burned for a moment with the fire of hatred. 'I have not forgotten!' 'The time will come for him,' Keira Metz teeth flashed ominously. 'But for now, this is not about him, but about Ciri and the Elder Blood which is so important to us, who is held by Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard.' 'The Emperor,' Assire said quietly, looking at Fringilla, 'has nothing in his hands. The girl being held in Rowan is not a carrier of any extraordinary gene. She is normal to commonplace.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Fringilla
"But you can reassure her. The Geralt is fine now. He's even started sending a Brokilon emissary with the task of finding traces of the princess Ciri, the young one who has so interetested you all. Our friend Geralt apparently does not know that Ciri is in Nilfgaard where she is being prepared for her marriage to Emperor Emhyr. The Geralt must be anxious as he sits quietly in Brokilon, so I will try to send him this news.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well. The problem would solve itself, I am sure that treacherous black-haired beauty would not anticipate the day nor the hour. The Geralt does not like it when someone touches his little girl, Artaud Terranova conclusively found that out on Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"And perhaps you are too a prince in disguise? Tell me, please. It would seem the Kings wanted their hands on her, because your Ciri, from what I learned, was saved from Thanedd and sent straight to Nilfgaard, together with the traitorous sorcerers. At Nilfgaard she was welcomed with great revelry by Emperor Emhyr. And you know what?",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"''And you know as well as I, dear Phil, that the intelligence services of Emhyr are urgently looking for only those agents and emissaries, who vowed to rip Emhyr apart. Those who were meant to do his bidding in the cities or die, but betrayed him, their commands left unexecuted. Things look pretty strange, however we were confident that Cahir was ordered to capture princess Ciri and deliver her to Nilfgaard.'' New paragraph. ''The matter raised a reasonable amount of suspicion in me and strange though it may be, I have come up with some surprising theories. However, they are not meaningless, and I would like to discuss them with you in private.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream! Ciri is a Child Surprise, Geralt is tied to her by ties of destiny, and therefore he sees her in his dreams. Know that we are also headed to Nilfgaard to retrieve our Ciri, who has been kidnapped by the Emperor Emhyr. Whatever it takes to get her, the son of a bitch, we'll get her before he realizes!",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"But keep talking, Marshal.' 'The Geralt,' Vissegerd again pointed his finger at Geralt, 'after the death of Pavetta, wanted to take the girl, but Calanthe wouldn't allow it and threw him out. But he waited for the right time. When the war started with Nilfgaard and Cintra fell, he took advantage of the confusion and turmoil and kidnapped Ciri. He kept the girl hidden, because he knew that we were seeking her. And he eventually grew bored of her and sold her to Emhyr.' 'These are all lies and slander.' Dandelion bellowed.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"'In all that there is not one word of truth!' 'Shut up or I'll gag you. Combine the facts, Count. The Geralt had Ciri, now Emhyr Emreis has her. And the Geralt is arrested mixed in with the vanguard of the Nilfgaardian patrol. What does it mean?' Daniel Etcheverry shrugged.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"'It is also an absurdity,' he continued talking loudly and quickly, 'accusing Geralt of kidnapping Ciri from Cintra. Geralt found the girl after the massacre of the city, wandering and hid her from others, Nilfgaard agents that were looking for her. I myself was captured by these agents and subjected to torture, to confess where he had hidden Ciri! I did not say a word and these agents are now dead, they did not know with whom they had started with.' 'Your bravery,' said the Count 'was futile. Emhyr finally has Ciri.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"As everyone knows he intends to marry her and make her the Empress of Nilfgaard. For the time being he is hailing her as the Queen of Cintra and the surrounding area, which causes us many problems.' 'Emhyr,' declared the poet, 'could have sat on the throne of Cintra whenever he wanted. Ciri, whether she takes it however, has the right to the throne.' 'The right?' Vissegerd roared, splashing Geralt with saliva. 'Shit, she has no right! Let Emhyr marry her if he wishes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"'No.' said Dandelion. 'Vissegerd is the commander of this unit which is part of the Temerian army. And Ciri in the hands of Emhyr, is a threat to the unit and the army, and to my king and country. I have no intention of denying rumours surrounding Vissegerd's slander and undermining the authority of his commanded. I'm going to support him in proving that Ciri is a bastard and has no rights to the throne.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"Vilgefortz has disappeared without a trace. Tissaia de Vries committed suicide. You've become Queen of the Valley of the Flowers, The Emperor Emhyr rewarded you with the crown and sceptre in exchange for my Ciri, who he has sought for so long and now has to use as he sees fit. I was compressed and packed in a box for a month and a half as a jade statue. And you expect me to thank you for that.' 'That would be nice.' Francesca Findabair replied coldly.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"Are they surprised because they did not know Emhyr was trying to kidnap her to Nilfgaard? Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"But here is one obstacle... *** Aha, thought Triss Merigold, we finally begin to talk about what we started to. The sobering fact that Ciri is in Nilfgaard under Emhyr var Emreis's power. Far from the plans that are being established here... 'There is no question,' said Philippa, 'that Emhyr has hunted Ciri for a long time.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"Have you forgotten about Vilgefortz, ladies?' 'I have not.' Sabrina's eyes burned for a moment with the fire of hatred. 'I have not forgotten!' 'The time will come for him,' Keira Metz teeth flashed ominously. 'But for now, this is not about him, but about Ciri and the Elder Blood which is so important to us, who is held by Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard.'

She is normal to commonplace.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"Those who carry the gene, have it available even in their hair. I examined her hairs and I found something I did not understand. Now I get it.' 'So Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' Yennefer said quietly. 'She is not there.' 'She is not there.' Philippa Eilhart confirmed seriously. 'Emhyr was cheated, someone slipped him a doppelganger.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Emhyr
"As you can see, they are already before us, and to the North, they head for Brugge. Therefore, the only reasonable direction to flee is the East. Milva gave a knowing look to the Geralt, who refrained from commenting. We are just going to the East,  continued Zoltan Chivay. The only chance is to hide behind the front, and the Temerian army will be coming from the East, from the river Ina.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking. Zoltan Chivay whistled on his fingers, signaling it was time to end the salvaging, then he cast a professional eye over Roach, Pegasus, and Milva's black bay. Your horses,  he said, wrinkling his nose with an air of disapproval. They are useless.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"The dwarves were as strong as bulls, and the roads leading to the forests were not too grassy or muddy. The rain continued to fall incessantly. Milva was sullen and moody and when she spoke, it was merely to grumble that the horses hooves might crack at any time. Zoltan Chivay licked his lips in response, and told her he was a master at preparing horsemeat, which infuriated Milva even more. They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Scout Percival reported to them several times about groups of refugees hiding in the forest. They passed several such groups, and quickly at that, because the peasants, armed with pitchforks and stakes did not encourage them to make contact. It was suggested, however, to try to negotiate with them and leave the group of women from Kernow, but Zoltan was opposed to it and Milva supported him. The women also did not seem very keen to leave the company. This made it all the more strange that they behaved towards the dwarves with reserve and a certain dislike, mingled with fear, they hardly spoke at rest stops and stood on the sidelines.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"They spat, blew their noses in their fingers and farted loudly, which was usually followed by laughter, jokes and competitions. They only took the trouble to go deep into the bushes for larger commissions, and for lighter ones, they did not bother to go that far. The latter finally unnerved Milva, who strongly admonished Zoltan one morning when he took a piss on the ashes, still warm from the fire, without any concern for the audience around him. Zoltan was taken aback at this reprimand, and said that people who hide shamefully in the bushes are informers and plotters, it makes them easily recognisable as untrustworthy and deceitful. This eloquent justification however, had no affect on the archer.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"I'm good for myself and my immediate entourage. Geralt did not ask any more questions. *** During one of their stops, Geralt and Milva chatted longer with Zoltan Chivay, the incorrigible and compulsive altruist. The dwarf was well informed about the course of the war or at least he gave that impression. The attack,  he replied, trying again and again to silence Field Marshal Duda, who was now swearing loudly,  Came from Drieschot.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Geralt jumped up quickly, grabbed her under the arm, interrupting her wild screech, and from the corner of his eye he spotted the movement between the logs. He retreated quickly, bumping into Zoltan and his dwarves. Milva, who also saw the movement among the stumps, stretched her bow. Don't shoot,  he hissed. Take the little one away quickly.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"I like oatmeal. I'd be happy to eat it. Zoltan is right,  said Milva. And you be quiet, Dandelion, because its not poetic. If there's milk in the oatmeal, then there is a cow.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Geralt and the others heard it, but they were not able to distinguish the words. Those words must have had an impression on Yazon and Caleb, because the two dwarves turned on their heels and ran back towards the lilac bushes. Milva stretched her bow again, moving the tip, looking for a target. What the devil? barked Zoltan.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Many have already died, she said. Aye, aye, Zoltan, the wind was blowing towards us! Enough teeth chattering,  said Milva, lowering her bow. If you did not touch anything infected, you will be fine, don't worry. Indeed, thats if there really is any smallpox.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Fear,  whispered Dandelion,  is a human thing. In them is no longer anything human. Except their guts,  Milva croaked, carefully embedding her arrow on the string. Which I'm about to drill through with this arrow, those villains. There are thirteen of them,  said Zoltan Chivay with a sombre look.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Its green saddle had the embroidery of Nilfgaard and was covered in dark blood stains. It was impossible to know whether it was the blood of the slain rider or whether it was shed later when the horse had a new owner. 'Well the problem is ended.' Milva said, looking at Geralt. 'If there was a problem.' 'The real problem is that we do not know who the rider was, who was thrown from the saddle.' Zoltan murmured. 'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"They did not see any ghouls, or the slightest trace of their existence. Zoltan joked that all the monsters and demons that had eyes, had learned of the approaching army and seen the action of what the volunteers of Vergen had done to the deserters and fled into the deepest wilderness, where they were hiding in fear and chattering teeth. 'They need to guard their wives and daughters.' Milva growled. 'The monsters are aware that there are horny soldiers in the procession, and they would not let even a sheep pass. And if they put clothing on a willow tree, it would be just them and the knot hole.' Dandelion, who had no longer lost his humour and talkativeness, tightened the strings on his lute and began to compose a couplet to the use of willows, lustful soldiers and knot holes; the dwarf and the parrot competed in helping with the rhymes.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"And do not forget where you hid everything!' 'Rest assured.' 'Catch up to us when you can.' Zoltan tucked his hatchet into his belt and threw his backpack over his shoulder along with Sihil. 'We are crossing over O, then along the Chotla to Ina. Farewell.' 'Interesting.' Milva muttered to Geralt, when their weakened squad departed on the road, waving farewell to the four dwarves left behind. 'I wonder what was in those boxes, that they needed to bury them and mark the place. And so that none of us saw.' 'It's not our business.' 'I don't think,' Dandelion said softly while carefully guiding Pegasus among the fallen trunks, 'that the boxes contained clean underwear.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Caleb Stratton wants to get married but his bride's parents expelled him once for being penniless. And Zoltan...' 'Stop, Dandelion. Gossiping is for women.' 'I apologize, Milva.' 'There is no need to.' Once they cross the river, the dark damp strip of trees became more spares and turned into low birch trees and dry grassland. Despite this, they rode slowly. They followed the example of Milva, who immediately after leaving the forest, place a freckled little girl with braids into her saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"You know what, Zoltan? Somehow I feel safer here in Fen Carn.' 'I feel it to, but when the sun is up. Hopefully the ghouls let us live up till dawn.' Milva fumbled in her saddlebags and pulled out something shiny. 'A silver arrow head.' She explained to them. 'I saved it for just this occasion.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"You're a Geralt, a specialist, you'll defend us from them, I hope. Do these ghouls fight better than marauders?' 'You can't compare them. I asked you not to panic.' 'Will this be enough for a vampire?' Milva turned the silver tip, running her thumb along it to make sure it was sharp. 'Or a spirit?' 'It might work.' 'On my Sihil,' Zoltan growled, barring his sword, 'are etched dwarven runes to an ancient dwarven spell. Any ghoul that gets within the reach of my sword will remember me.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"'They are indeed, somewhat reminiscent of a man.' 'Twisted by back pain.' Zoltan said. 'And the other, looks like a pregnant woman. And this one, excuse me, looked like to people lying together.' 'You only have one thing on your mind.' Milva bravely swallowed the moonshine, and burst into a coughing fit. 'So... it is a strong spirit!",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"I can also tell you that mandrake is a powerful aphrodisiac, used in love magic, especially to break resistant women. Hence the popular name of mandrake: pucelesta. Which means, heaven to whores.' 'Stupid.' Milva commented. 'I heard,' the gnome said, raising the cup, 'that if the Alraune root is removed from the ground, it cries and complains as if alive.' 'Bah!' Zoltan said, shaking his head. 'If it only complained!",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"But sometimes he tends to tell the truth. Let's go back in. I want to drink more.' 'Milva?' 'What?' 'You never told me why you decided to come with me.' 'You never asked.' 'I'm asking now.' 'It is too late. Now I don't even know.' *** 'Well finally, you're back.' Zoltan greeted them cheerfully. 'Now we are all here, imagine this, Regis has decided to journey with us.' 'Really?' Geralt looked at the alchemist.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"'You've said too much!' 'Scopolamine.' Regis muttered under his breath. *** The gnome talked nonsense. Milva frowned. Zoltan, forgetting that he already told everyone about the old fart, Hogg the Mahakam thane, started again. Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"He can remember his name and what happened. This is a good sign. The lively emotions of Lady Milva did not, fortunately, have consequences.' The Geralt looked at the archer, who was sitting next to them on rock, her eyes lost in the distance. 'She isn't a delicate lady susceptible to such emotions,' he muttered. 'I would blame the residue of the belladonna from yesterday.' 'She has vomited before.' Zoltan interjected quietly.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"You are not a white freak from hell, and you Uncle Dandelion, you're not a gaudy peacock. The old woman lied. And you Aunt Milva, you're no pervert with a bow, Aunt Milva, I like you. For you I've picked the prettiest flowers.' 'Thank you.' said Milva with a sad voice. 'We all thank you.' Zoltan repeated.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Anyone can clearly see you are a scoundrel and a bully! With your sword, you want to pass the judgement of God?' 'If you do not like the sword,' said Zoltan, coming to stand next to Geralt, 'and if this fellow does not fit you, maybe I will be worthy? Come on let those who accuse the girl beat me with the axe.' 'Or me with the bow.' said Milva, squinting, also emerging from the crowd. 'One arrow at a hundred paces.' 'You see, people, how quickly they multiply to defend the witch?' shouted the priest, then turned and twisted his face into a sly smile. 'Well, scoundrels I accept the ordeal for your trio.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"But if the judgement of God shows something else, then you die with her! I have spoken!' The murmurs of displeasure from Mayor Laabs and his group were drowned out by the shouts of those gathered by the priest, anticipating a great show and rejoicing. Milva looked at Zoltan, Zoltan the Geralt, the Geralt at the sky, and then at Milva. 'Do you believe in gods?' He asked in a low voice. 'I believe,' said the archer quietly, staring intently at the embers in the fire.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"'Please refrain from praying.' The surgeon approached the fire, respectfully bowed to the priest and to the audience and then without the slightest hesitation, reached his hand into the burning coals. The crowd gasped in unison, Zoltan cursed. Milva grasped Geralt's arm. Regis straightened up, looked calmly at the horseshoe in his hand and without hurrying, approached the priest. The priest stepped back, but crashed into the peasants who were behind him.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"The encampment was a smoking ruin after the assault, but it appeared the peasants who survived did not flee too far. Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"The guards standing next to the shed chatted idly, laughing and occasionally cleared their throats and spat for long periods. The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself. Even if they survived, they cannot help us.' 'Why?' 'For three reasons. First, because they have their own problems.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"Percival, do you see what I'm seeing?' Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him. And when the rest of the company emerged from behind the piles of logs, the shouts of delight intensified accordingly. 'Milva! Regis!' Zoltan shouted, squeezing all. 'Dandelion, alive, albeit with a bandage on his head!",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"While I don't question motives, I am slowly learning the art of looking beneath the masks.' *** Geralt waved Sihil across the path of a passing moth. After parting with Zoltan and his group, the Geralt recalled, we found a group of peasants wandering in the woods. Some fled at the sight of us, but Milva stopped a few, threatening them with her bow. The peasants, as it turned out, were, until recently, Nilfgaardian prisoners. They were being used to cut down cedars for the emperor, until a few days ago, when a detachment attached the guards and released them.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Zoltan
"That is the emblem of...' 'Cintra.' confirmed the Count. 'These are exiles from the kingdom of Cintra, now occupied by Nilfgaard. Marshal Vissegerd leads them.' Geralt turned to the Count and opened his mouth to say that an urgent matter would force them to nevertheless refuse the lunch invitation. He did not make it. He saw a group of officers approaching them, headed by a strong, thick, gray-haired knight in a blue cloak and gold chain armor.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"He saw a group of officers approaching them, headed by a strong, thick, gray-haired knight in a blue cloak and gold chain armor. 'Here, Sir Poets, is the Marshal Vissegerd in person.' Daniel Etcheverry said. 'Allow me the honour of introducing...' 'There is no need.' Marshal Vissegerd interrupted hoarsely, his eyes drilling into Geralt. 'We have already been introduced. In Cintra, at the court of Queen Calanthe.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"At the engagement of Princess Pavetta. It was fifteen years ago, but I have a good memory. And you, bastard Geralt, do you remember me?' 'I remember.' Geralt said and obediently let the soldiers bind his hands. *** Daniel Etcheverry, Count of Garramone, tried to intercede for Geralt and Dandelion, when the soldier had settled them on chairs in the Marshal's tent. When the soldiers left at Vissegerd's order, the Count resumed his efforts.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"It is not appropriate to do this to him. On my honour, I guarantee that he is not a nilfgaardian spy.' 'Do not swear so hastily, Count.' said Vissegerd, not taking his eyes off the bound men. 'Perhaps he is a poet, but he was captured in the company of this miscreant Geralt, I would not vouch for him. It seems to me that you still don't realize what bird you have caught in your snares.' 'The Geralt?' 'Of course, Geralt, who is called the White Wolf. The same rogue who laid claim to the right of Ciri, Pavetta's daughter, granddaughter of Calanthe, the same Ciri of who there is so much talk of now.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"But I was an eye witness to those events.' 'And what binds him to the princess Ciri?' 'That dog,' the Marshal pointed at Geralt, 'contributed to the marriage of Pavetta, daughter of Queen Calanthe, to Duny, an unknown stranger from the south. From this shameful union was born Ciri. Even before her birth she was promised to that bastard Geralt as payment for his help in conducting the marriage. Have you heard of the Law of Surprise?' 'Not at all. But keep talking, Marshal.' 'The Geralt,' Vissegerd again pointed his finger at Geralt, 'after the death of Pavetta, wanted to take the girl, but Calanthe wouldn't allow it and threw him out.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"Combine the facts, Count. The Geralt had Ciri, now Emhyr Emreis has her. And the Geralt is arrested mixed in with the vanguard of the Nilfgaardian patrol. What does it mean?' Daniel Etcheverry shrugged. 'What does it mean?' Vissegerd repeated, leaning on Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"As everyone knows he intends to marry her and make her the Empress of Nilfgaard. For the time being he is hailing her as the Queen of Cintra and the surrounding area, which causes us many problems.' 'Emhyr,' declared the poet, 'could have sat on the throne of Cintra whenever he wanted. Ciri, whether she takes it however, has the right to the throne.' 'The right?' Vissegerd roared, splashing Geralt with saliva. 'Shit, she has no right! Let Emhyr marry her if he wishes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"And then I wouldn't be so sure of the loyalty of your army.' Vissegerd covered the distance between him and Dandelion in two steps and grabbed him by the front of his shirt and lifted him from the chair. The face of the Marshal which was a moment ago calm was now flushed a heraldic red. Geralt started to strongly worry about the health of his friend, when suddenly an Adjutant rushed in and excitedly started announcing that urgent and important news had been brought back by a patrol. Vissegerd released Dandelion, knocked over the chair and left. 'Uff...' groaned the poet, shaking his head and neck.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"A few hundred desert and the king Foltest removes the baton. Already, it is difficult to call this army Cintran. Vissegerd thrashes about, wanting to stop the desertions, thus he is spreading the rumours of the uncertain origin of Princess Ciri and her ancestors.' 'What of yourself, Count,' Geralt could not help it. 'You listen with clear distaste.' 'You have noticed?' Daniel Etcheverry smile slightly. 'Vissegerd knows about my lineage...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
But I do not react. Because I am a soldier. Do you understand my lords?' 'Yes.' said Geralt. 'No.' said Dandelion. 'Vissegerd is the commander of this unit which is part of the Temerian army.,Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"'Vissegerd,' he said quietly, 'is furious. You had bad luck falling into his hands. Especially you, Sir Geralt. I will try Mister Dandelion...' He was interrupted by the entrance of Vissegerd, still red and angry as a bull. The Marshal approached the table, slammed his baton on it and deposited a map atop it, then turned to Geralt and drilled him with his eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"Scissors, a piece of broken glass, even an awl! The whore could have slit her wrists with her own teeth! Hung herself with a stocking!' 'I will hear no more, Vissegerd.' Geralt said quietly. 'I will hear no more.' The Marshal audibly gritted his teeth and bent. 'You will hear no more.' He said in a voice trembling with rage.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"However, it was an impossible task for someone who was lying in a pile of sawdust and shavings and was bound with ropes like a ham about to be smoked. 'We were not handed immediately,' he gasped. 'There is hope...' 'Calm down,' the Geralt lay quietly, watching the moon visible through a hole in the roof of the woodshed. 'Do you know why Vissegerd didn't hang us right away? Because we are to be executed publicly at dawn, when the entire army has gathered.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"Because we are to be executed publicly at dawn, when the entire army has gathered. For propaganda.' Dandelion was silent. Geralt heard him sniff regretfully. 'You still have a chance to escape,' he said to appease him. 'Vissegerd wants to carry out his private vendetta against me, but he has nothing against you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"Secondly, I witness a personal vendetta, he will not leave me alive. No, brother, we'll swing together.' 'Stop, Dandelion. Stay quietly and think of a plan.' 'What plan, dammit?' 'Anything.' The speech of the poet prevented the Geralt from concentrating. He needs something. He expected at any moment the woodshed would be invaded by Temerian military intelligence, who would certainly be working for Vissegerd.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"He expected at any moment the woodshed would be invaded by Temerian military intelligence, who would certainly be working for Vissegerd. The Secret Service would certainly like to ask him about the various details of the events at Garstang on island of Thanedd. Geralt knew almost no details, but he knew that before the agents would believe him, he would become very, very sick. His only hope was on Vissegerd, blinded by the desire for revenge, had not notified the agents of his capture. The Secret Service would be able to remove the prisoners for the claws of the angry Marshal and take them back to their headquarters.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"He kept repeating to himself that there was nothing surprising about any of this –in the middle of a busy night two people wouldn't be noticed, they could only be threatened if someone raised the alarm after finding the guards sleeping at the woodshed. Now, however, they approaching the perimeter where sentries necessarily had to be vigilant. It was while leaving the camp that the Geralt remembered that there was in Vissegerd's command the scourge of desertion and he was sure that the guards were ordered to give careful attention to any who wished to leave the camp. The moon gave enough light so that Dandelion did not have to grope. The Geralt could see in this light as well as in the day, so they managed to avoid two mounted soldiers while waiting in the bushes for the patrol to pass by.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"The swarm of Nilfgaardians approaching them was now a much greater threat that Vissegerd and his army, so they galloped along the ring of guard posts surrounding the camp, trying to get as far possible from the lines that could flare up at any moment when the two armies clashed. The Nilfgaardians, however, were close and saw them. Dandelion yelled, Geralt looked back and saw as the dark wall of Nilfgaardians started to stretch out riders towards them like black tentacles. Without hesitation, they turned the horse towards the camp, overtaking the fleeing guards. Dandelion yelled again, but this time it was unnecessary.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"The Geralt had also seen the cavalry rushing from the side of the camp. Vissegerd's army, stirred by the alarm, had mounted their horses in a time worthy of admiration. Geralt and Dandelion found themselves trapped. There was no way out. The Geralt changed direction again and forced the horse to gallop with all its might, trying to escape from the swiftly narrowing gap between the rock and the hard place.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"'Even if the peasants got the emblems wrong, we are not dealing with the army of Temeria. And I do not think the news has reached the Queen of Rivia about two spies that not long ago enigmatically escaped the gallows of Marshal Vissegerd. If we stumble upon these guerrillas, we will have a chance to talk to them.' 'We can count on that,' Geralt said. 'But to be honest, I would prefer to avoid them altogether.' 'But these people are your countrymen, Geralt,' Regis said. 'After all they call you, Geralt of Rivia.' 'A mistake,' he said in a cold voice.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Vissegerd
"Next to her, emerging from the misty light projection, was Sheala de Tancarville in a black velvet gown trimmed with pearls, her neck wrapped with a silver fox boa.

"Soon a few people will know my shock. I give you my word.' In the same way she had been affected by the teasing, Francesca was unmoved by the threats.

What damn snare entangles this girl?",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Francesca
"It became immediately clear that her hopes were going to be dashed. Margarita m clearly wished to speak with her, Philippa quickly pulled her to the other end of the hall.

"But I never questioned her abilities.' 'She will tell everything!' Sabrina Glevissig shouted. 'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.'

To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"'Most of us saw Ciri on Thanedd, where she was in a trance and her predictions caused considerable commotion. Some of us have even had close contact with her. I speak mostly of you, Yennefer. It is time you spoke.' When Yennefer told the audience about Ciri, Triss Merigold closely watched her friend. Yennefer spoke calmly and without emotion, but Triss had known her for a long time and very well.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"Yennefer spoke calmly and without emotion, but Triss had known her for a long time and very well. She had seen her in many situations, including those that had caused stress, tiredness and depression. It was without a doubt that Yennefer was in this kind of situation. She looked dejected, tired and sick. The sorceress spoke, but Triss, who knew both the story and the person to which it referred, was devoted to quietly watching all those listening.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"Are they surprised because they did not know Emhyr was trying to kidnap her to Nilfgaard? Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"Mistake, Enid, mistake, mistake! Too much spontaneity, too many accidents. Too little control, too little interference with chance.' 'We were not,' Enid an Gleanna, pursed her lips, 'dealing with rabbits, which can be locked in a cage and their parks chosen for them.' Fringilla, following the gaze of Triss Merigold, saw Yennefer's hands clench suddenly the carved arms of her chair. *** This is what now unites Yennefer and Francesca, Triss thought feverishly, still avoiding eye contact. The calculation.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes. Damn, thought Yennefer, with effort keeping an indifferent expression on her face. What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes...",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"Triss Merigold, who approached her was accompanied by Francesca. The elf monitored the conversation without embarrassment. But Yennefer saw the anxiety in Triss's eyes and she was sure had the conversation had no witnesses it would have been full of useless pleas for help. Triss no doubt had committed her whole soul to the Lodge already. And no doubt sense that Yennefer's loyalty was still uncertain.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"Triss tried to comfort her, to ensure her that Geralt was safe and was recovering in Brokilon with the dryads who were helping him back to health. As always, talk of Geralt made her blush. He must have accommodated her, Yennefer thought without malice. She hasn't known anyone like him before. She will not soon forget about him That's good.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Triss
"And now I will say goodbye! Sabrina Glevissig yelled, pointing at Francesca with her hand covered in rings. You went too far, Philippa! I'm not going to sit at the same table as the damn elf, even as an illusion! She failed to clean the blood from the walls and floors of Garstang.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Not mine! Are you implying something? Of course,  Philippa Eilhart interjected. Of course, Sabrina gently reminds us of my work with Sigismund Dijkstra. As if she herself had never maintained any contact with the agents of King Henselt.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"This smacks of feminist chauvinism. sneered Sabrina Glevissig. Especially from your mouth, Philippa, after your change of ... sexual orientation. I have nothing against men.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"It's a sad fate that awaits us all. Sabrina finished quickly. Philippa, Triss and I, all three of us were at Sodden Hill. Emhyr will make us pay, as we will pay forThanedd, and for the entirety of our involvement. But this is just one of the reservations that stops me from agreeing to the declared political neutrality of the convention.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery. Sabrina Glevissig has not surrendered her political influence, which is in Kaedwen, but will not betray the Lodge. She draws power, which she gives to the Lodge.' 'And this Assire var Anahid?",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable. Sile de Tansarville, a researcher, immediately found a lot of common topics with the researcher Assire var Anahid and Fringilla quickly gained a liking to the cheerful Triss Merigold.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"The conversations were accompanied by the greed absorption of oysters. Only Sabrina Glevissig refused, being a faithful daughter of Kaedwen's forests, she even expressed her contempt for the  slimy filth  and her desire for a piece of cold venison with prunes. Philippa Eilhart, instead of responding to the insult with icy haughtiness, pulled a bell rope and soon inconspicuous and noiseless servants delivered meat. Fringilla was astonished. Well, she thought, different regions, different manners.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"It is time we fix that error.' 'You, of course, mean yourself?' Sabrina Glevissig leaned over the table. 'Obviously on the throne of Redania? Her highness Philippa the First? With Dijkstra as prince consort?' 'I do not mean myself. I do not mean the kingdom of Redania.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"After all, it would constitute an affront to us all to be set a less noble task, even teetering on the verge of reality and feasibility. It would be like driving a nail with an astrolabe. No, no, it is better to start with a completely impossible task.' 'Why is it impossible?' 'Have mercy, Philippa,' said Sabrina Glevissig. 'None of the kings will ever marry a sorceress, no country will accept a sorceress on the throne. It has been a custom for centuries.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts. She had already guessed that some of those collected here were in opposite camps during the Thanedd rebellion; she was not surprised, therefore, when the antipathies came to the table in the form of remarks aimed at Yennefer. It looked as if a quarrel was to break out, which was prevented by Philippa Eilhart who unceremoniously banged her open palm onto the top of the table until the cups and goblets rang. 'Enough!' she shouted. 'Shut up, Sabrina!",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"Well, she thought, because of it occurring it has created this Lodge. The devil knows how it will end, but it is to begin. 'Continue, Yennefer.' Philippa said. 'I have nothing more to say.' The black-haired sorceress pursed her lips. 'I repeat, it was Tissaia de Vries who ordered me to bring Ciri to Garstang.' 'It is easier to blame everything on the dead.' Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture.",Baptism of Fire,Philippa,Sabrina
"It was fifteen years ago, but I have a good memory. And you, bastard Geralt, do you remember me?' 'I remember.' Geralt said and obediently let the soldiers bind his hands. *** Daniel Etcheverry, Count of Garramone, tried to intercede for Geralt and Dandelion, when the soldier had settled them on chairs in the Marshal's tent. When the soldiers left at Vissegerd's order, the Count resumed his efforts. 'This is the poet and troubadour Dandelion, Sir Marshal,' he explained.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"Cursed blood, the whole female line of this family is cursed, vile creatures, beginning with Riannon! Ciri's great-grandmother, Adalia played the harlot with her cousin as her mother Muriel, fornicated with everyone! From this blood only incestuous whores are born.' 'Speak softly, Marshal.' Dandelion said cheekily. 'Before your tent hangs a banner with golden lions, and you are about to hail Ciri's grandmother, Calanthe, the Lioness of Cintra, for which most of your troops spilt blood for at Marnadal and Sodden as an amoral and adulterous bitch. And then I wouldn't be so sure of the loyalty of your army.' Vissegerd covered the distance between him and Dandelion in two steps and grabbed him by the front of his shirt and lifted him from the chair.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"The face of the Marshal which was a moment ago calm was now flushed a heraldic red. Geralt started to strongly worry about the health of his friend, when suddenly an Adjutant rushed in and excitedly started announcing that urgent and important news had been brought back by a patrol. Vissegerd released Dandelion, knocked over the chair and left. 'Uff...' groaned the poet, shaking his head and neck. 'That was close, he would have strangled me...",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"Because I am a soldier. Do you understand my lords?' 'Yes.' said Geralt. 'No.' said Dandelion. 'Vissegerd is the commander of this unit which is part of the Temerian army. And Ciri in the hands of Emhyr, is a threat to the unit and the army, and to my king and country.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"You had bad luck falling into his hands. Especially you, Sir Geralt. I will try Mister Dandelion...' He was interrupted by the entrance of Vissegerd, still red and angry as a bull. The Marshal approached the table, slammed his baton on it and deposited a map atop it, then turned to Geralt and drilled him with his eyes. The withcer did not lower his eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"'Do you know why Vissegerd didn't hang us right away? Because we are to be executed publicly at dawn, when the entire army has gathered. For propaganda.' Dandelion was silent. Geralt heard him sniff regretfully. 'You still have a chance to escape,' he said to appease him.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"Now, however, they approaching the perimeter where sentries necessarily had to be vigilant. It was while leaving the camp that the Geralt remembered that there was in Vissegerd's command the scourge of desertion and he was sure that the guards were ordered to give careful attention to any who wished to leave the camp. The moon gave enough light so that Dandelion did not have to grope. The Geralt could see in this light as well as in the day, so they managed to avoid two mounted soldiers while waiting in the bushes for the patrol to pass by. Just before them was a dark alder grove lying just on the other side of the ring of posts.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"The swarm of Nilfgaardians approaching them was now a much greater threat that Vissegerd and his army, so they galloped along the ring of guard posts surrounding the camp, trying to get as far possible from the lines that could flare up at any moment when the two armies clashed. The Nilfgaardians, however, were close and saw them. Dandelion yelled, Geralt looked back and saw as the dark wall of Nilfgaardians started to stretch out riders towards them like black tentacles. Without hesitation, they turned the horse towards the camp, overtaking the fleeing guards. Dandelion yelled again, but this time it was unnecessary.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"The Geralt had also seen the cavalry rushing from the side of the camp. Vissegerd's army, stirred by the alarm, had mounted their horses in a time worthy of admiration. Geralt and Dandelion found themselves trapped. There was no way out. The Geralt changed direction again and forced the horse to gallop with all its might, trying to escape from the swiftly narrowing gap between the rock and the hard place.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"'In short, in this area is Nordling guerrilla units. Some of the branches probably formed from the remnant of the armies of Lyria and Rivia, broken in mid-July at Aldersberg. I heard of the battle when I was captured by the Squirrels.' 'This is good news,' Dandelion said, proud that he had managed to decipher the riddle of the gorillas. 'Even if the peasants got the emblems wrong, we are not dealing with the army of Temeria. And I do not think the news has reached the Queen of Rivia about two spies that not long ago enigmatically escaped the gallows of Marshal Vissegerd.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Vissegerd
"Look, Dandelion,  he said, grabbing the wrist and raising the released hand. You see this scar on his hand? Its where Ciri cut him. On the island of Thanedd, a month ago. He's a Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"Still the same. Milva and Dandelion were silent. Ciri,  he took a moment,  does not sleep in the palace under a brocade canopy. She's riding on horseback through some dusty village ... The villagers point fingers.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion. 'You were seriously wounded, a carter drove you out. At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream! Ciri is a Child Surprise, Geralt is tied to her by ties of destiny, and therefore he sees her in his dreams.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"But keep talking, Marshal.' 'The Geralt,' Vissegerd again pointed his finger at Geralt, 'after the death of Pavetta, wanted to take the girl, but Calanthe wouldn't allow it and threw him out. But he waited for the right time. When the war started with Nilfgaard and Cintra fell, he took advantage of the confusion and turmoil and kidnapped Ciri. He kept the girl hidden, because he knew that we were seeking her. And he eventually grew bored of her and sold her to Emhyr.' 'These are all lies and slander.' Dandelion bellowed.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"Any wizard who was on Thanedd. And the Redanian Chancellor, Count Sigismund Dijkstra...' Dandelion stopped suddenly, remembering that Dijkstra was completely unsuitable as a defence witness in this case, and invoking the wizards of Thanedd to improve their position was not a good idea either. 'It is also an absurdity,' he continued talking loudly and quickly, 'accusing Geralt of kidnapping Ciri from Cintra. Geralt found the girl after the massacre of the city, wandering and hid her from others, Nilfgaard agents that were looking for her. I myself was captured by these agents and subjected to torture, to confess where he had hidden Ciri!",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"Her cursed and tainted blood has no right to the throne! Cursed blood, the whole female line of this family is cursed, vile creatures, beginning with Riannon! Ciri's great-grandmother, Adalia played the harlot with her cousin as her mother Muriel, fornicated with everyone! From this blood only incestuous whores are born.' 'Speak softly, Marshal.' Dandelion said cheekily. 'Before your tent hangs a banner with golden lions, and you are about to hail Ciri's grandmother, Calanthe, the Lioness of Cintra, for which most of your troops spilt blood for at Marnadal and Sodden as an amoral and adulterous bitch.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"'No.' said Dandelion. 'Vissegerd is the commander of this unit which is part of the Temerian army. And Ciri in the hands of Emhyr, is a threat to the unit and the army, and to my king and country. I have no intention of denying rumours surrounding Vissegerd's slander and undermining the authority of his commanded. I'm going to support him in proving that Ciri is a bastard and has no rights to the throne.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning. Geralt know that that there were three of them, so he listened, but the third soldier issued no sound.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"'You're starting to be afraid? It is about time.' 'Shut up,' Dandelion raised his eyebrows. 'We have accepted him as a companion; he has offered his support to help find Ciri. He pulled my own neck out of the noose, I will not forget that. But, don't be surprised that we have concerns, damn it.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses. They might not want to talk to us, let alone use magic.' 'Regis,' reminded the Geralt, 'knows someone among those of Caed Dhu.' 'And this knowledge doesn't go back three or four hundred years?' 'It is far more recent,' the vampire said with an enigmatic smile.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Dandelion
"'Herbalist, barber or surgeon. No offence, but you smell like an apothecary.' Emiel Regis smiled a thin-lipped smile and raised his hands apologetically. 'The smell gave you away, sir surgeon,' said Geralt, sliding his sword into its sheath. 'Did you have a specific reason why you were hiding from us?' 'Specific?' The man turned his black eyes on him. 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"Come on, we'll introduce you to the rest of our company.' As they approached the camp, the horses snorted and beat the ground with their hooves. 'Stand a little upwind, Mister Regis.' Zoltan threw the medic a meaningful look. 'The smell of sage frightens the mounts, and to me, I'm ashamed to admit it, I associate it with pulling teeth.' *** 'Geralt,' murmured Zoltan as Emiel Regis disappeared behind a hanging curtain, which substituted as a door for his cabin. 'Let's keep our eyes open. I do not like this smelly herbalist.' 'Any particular reason?' 'I'm suspicious of people who spend their summers near cemeteries.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"It doesn't happen.' 'Never, if we are dealing with higher vampires,' Emiel Regis joined the conversation. 'From what I understand, the victims of Alps, Katakan, Mula, Bruxa, Nosferat are not hurt terribly. However, Fleders and Ekimma are quite brutal with their victims.' 'Well done,' Geralt looked at him with unfeigned admiration. 'You did not miss any kind of vampire. And you have not mentioned any of the mythical ones, which only exist in fairy tales.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"A horrible bloodsucker. And now I have stumbled upon a Geralt, a professional whose job it is to eliminate those like me. That's all.' 'That's enough,' Geralt lowered his sword. 'Get up. Get out of here, Emiel Regis and who knows what else.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"Same to you.' Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy snapped his cloak, wrapped it around himself and disappeared. Simply disappeared. 'Now,' Geralt turned naked sword still in his hand, 'it's your turn, Nilfgaardian...' 'No,' Milva interrupted angrily. 'I've had enough. Get the horses, and let's get out of here!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head. 'Comrades in arms! A team of heroes!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"Bad luck or fate? The cranes blew a trumpeting call. *** Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy rode at the head of the procession mounted on a Nilfgaardian bay captured by the Geralt in Armeria. The stallion, although at first it was bothered by the vampire and his herbal scent, soon became accustomed and caused little trouble unlike Roach who kicked like he was being bitten by horseflies. Behind Regis and Geralt rode Dandelion on Pegasus with his head bandaged like a war hero.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emiel
"Some of us have even had close contact with her. I speak mostly of you, Yennefer. It is time you spoke.' When Yennefer told the audience about Ciri, Triss Merigold closely watched her friend. Yennefer spoke calmly and without emotion, but Triss had known her for a long time and very well. She had seen her in many situations, including those that had caused stress, tiredness and depression.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl. About her study in the temple of Melitele and Ciri's mysterious abilities. They listen with stone faces, thought Triss, looking at Assire and Fringilla. Like sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"Are they surprised because they did not know Emhyr was trying to kidnap her to Nilfgaard? Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"But here is one obstacle... *** Aha, thought Triss Merigold, we finally begin to talk about what we started to. The sobering fact that Ciri is in Nilfgaard under Emhyr var Emreis's power. Far from the plans that are being established here... 'There is no question,' said Philippa, 'that Emhyr has hunted Ciri for a long time.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together. I understand everything.' 'And I don't understand anything!' Sabrina screamed out loud again. Assire var Anahid leaned towards her friend.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Triss
"Making this fact a profound secret even from me, hurt me terribly. But you can reassure her. The Geralt is fine now. He's even started sending a Brokilon emissary with the task of finding traces of the princess Ciri, the young one who has so interetested you all. Our friend Geralt apparently does not know that Ciri is in Nilfgaard where she is being prepared for her marriage to Emperor Emhyr.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emhyr
"We are writing to Philippa, not to the royal council, the letter has to look aesthetically pleasing! New paragraph. I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emhyr
"On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well. The problem would solve itself, I am sure that treacherous black-haired beauty would not anticipate the day nor the hour. The Geralt does not like it when someone touches his little girl, Artaud Terranova conclusively found that out on Thanedd. I would like to believe, Phil, that you do not withhold evidence of Yennefer's treason and do not know where she is hiding. I would be very sorry if it turned out, that there is another secret kept from me.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emhyr
"'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream!

"'In all that there is not one word of truth!' 'Shut up or I'll gag you. Combine the facts, Count. The Geralt had Ciri, now Emhyr Emreis has her. And the Geralt is arrested mixed in with the vanguard of the Nilfgaardian patrol. What does it mean?' Daniel Etcheverry shrugged.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emhyr
"As everyone knows he intends to marry her and make her the Empress of Nilfgaard. For the time being he is hailing her as the Queen of Cintra and the surrounding area, which causes us many problems.' 'Emhyr,' declared the poet, 'could have sat on the throne of Cintra whenever he wanted. Ciri, whether she takes it however, has the right to the throne.' 'The right?' Vissegerd roared, splashing Geralt with saliva. 'Shit, she has no right! Let Emhyr marry her if he wishes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Emhyr
"Ida stood out among the group not only for her hair colour. Among her jewellery was not an ounce of minerals, or a precious stone, she wore only pearls, coral and amber. The source of the greatest excitement, however, was clearly the third sorceress, Yennefer, raven-haired, dressed in black and white, contrary to Fringilla's first impression, she was not an elf. Her appearance in Montecalvo had been a tremendous surprise, and not pleasant for everyone. Fringilla felt from some of the sorceresses an aura of antipathy and hostility.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"'We know each other,' she said, touching an obsidian star at her throat. The room suddenly fell into a silence full of anticipation. 'We have seen each other before,' Yennefer repeated. 'I do not remember.' Fringilla stared back. 'I am not surprised.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Especially the two witches from Nilfgaard. Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress. And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts. She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face. She was not fooled. A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts.

'We were not,' Enid an Gleanna, pursed her lips, 'dealing with rabbits, which can be locked in a cage and their parks chosen for them.' Fringilla, following the gaze of Triss Merigold, saw Yennefer's hands clench suddenly the carved arms of her chair. *** This is what now unites Yennefer and Francesca, Triss thought feverishly, still avoiding eye contact. The calculation.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"She ate carefully, still feeling pain, the effects of the compression. She was afraid to drink wine, she wasn't sure who she would react. 'Yennefer?' She turned around slowly. Fringilla Vigo smiled slightly, looking at the small knife she clenched in her fist. 'I see and feel,' she said, 'that you would rather thrust that knife into me than the oysters.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Is there still enmity?' 'The Lodge,' Yennefer replied coolly, 'requires mutual loyalty. Friendship is not mandatory.' 'It is not and nor should it be,' the Nilfgaardian sorceress looked around the room. 'Friendship is the result of a long process, or it is spontaneous.' 'The same is true of enmity.' Yennefer opened one of the oysters and swallowed the contents along with the sea water. 'Sometimes you see someone for a split second, just before they blind you, and you do not like them.' 'Oh, the issue of enmity is much more complicated.' Fringilla squinted. 'Let's say someone you do not recognise at top of a hill, smashes to pieces your friend, right before your eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Everybody says that these two enemies can speak with each other. They talk about nothing important. They just turn to banalities, throwing jabs from time to time.' 'No doubt,' Yennefer nodded, 'so everyone thinks. And they have it absolutely right.' 'It will then be convenient,' Fringilla did not dismiss her, 'that we are in such a circumstance as to raise a question, both important and unique.' 'And what question did you have in mind?' 'The question of the escape you are planning.' Yennefer, in the process of opening another oyster, almost sliced her finger. She looked around furtively, then looked at the Nilfgaardian from behind lowered eyelashes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Especially now, in these conditions with the war blockade... The blockades are a terrible thing. Agreed?' Yennefer coughed softly. 'I noticed,' Fringilla swallowed an oyster, then reached for another one, 'Yes, Philippa is watching us. Assire too.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"'Oh, this is not an option. I am loyal to the Lodge and the Lodge, it is obvious does not want you hurrying away to try and save you loved ones. In addition, I am your enemy, how could you forget about that, Yennefer?' 'Certainly. How could I?' 'A friend,' Fringilla said quietly, 'would warn that even with the components for a teleport spell, you'd fail to break the blockade unnoticed. This operation requires time and is obvious.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Fringilla
"Do I have to tear it from you, along with the corset?' *** The silence that ensued at the table following the speech by Philippa Eilhart was shortly replaced by a cacophony. The sorceresses expressed surprise and disbelief, demanding explanations. Some no doubt knew a lot about this foreseen ruler of the North, Ciri or Ciri another name they were familiar with, but they knew less. Fringilla Vigo knew nothing about the suspicions and speculations, and concentrated mainly on a certain lock of hair. Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent. Philippa Eilhart took the floor again. 'Most of us saw Ciri on Thanedd, where she was in a trance and her predictions caused considerable commotion. Some of us have even had close contact with her. I speak mostly of you, Yennefer.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence. And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is. Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"'Continue, Yennefer.' Philippa said. 'I have nothing more to say.' The black-haired sorceress pursed her lips. 'I repeat, it was Tissaia de Vries who ordered me to bring Ciri to Garstang.' 'It is easier to blame everything on the dead.' Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture. 'I did not want to interfere in what was happening in Aretuza,' said Yennefer, pale and clearly upset. 'I wanted to take Ciri and escape from Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
The two of us make a mistake. But mine was bigger. If I had left Ciri in Rita's care...' 'What has happened can not be undone.' Philippa interrupted. 'Mistakes can happened to anyone. Even Tissaia de Vries.,Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"'The Lara gene can only be transmitted continuously through the female line. If the carrier is male, the gene is lost after the second or third generation.' 'But then activates again.' Philippa Eilhart said. 'Adalia, who was lacking the gene, was at the end of the day the mother of Calanthe and Calanthe was the grandmother of Ciri who is a carrier of the Lara gene.' 'The first since Riannon.' Sile de Tansarville spoke suddenly. 'You made a mistake, Francesca. There are two genes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"But here is one obstacle... *** Aha, thought Triss Merigold, we finally begin to talk about what we started to. The sobering fact that Ciri is in Nilfgaard under Emhyr var Emreis's power. Far from the plans that are being established here... 'There is no question,' said Philippa, 'that Emhyr has hunted Ciri for a long time.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"Those who carry the gene, have it available even in their hair. I examined her hairs and I found something I did not understand. Now I get it.' 'So Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' Yennefer said quietly. 'She is not there.' 'She is not there.' Philippa Eilhart confirmed seriously. 'Emhyr was cheated, someone slipped him a doppelganger.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes... 'There will therefore be a great opportunity,' Keira Metz cried excitedly 'to regain Ciri and also rip the skin from Vilgefortz, then set fire to the floor under the rogue's ass!' 'Burning the ground will be preceded by discovering Vilgefortz hideout,' Sile de Tansarville scoffed, who had never had much sympathy for Yennefer. 'And so far none have succeeded. Even some of the ladies sitting at this table have spared their invaluable time and talents in the search.' 'We have already found two of Vilgefortz many hiding places.' Philippa Eilhart replied coolly.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Philippa
"*** The spell of teleprojection was tricky, the sorcerers were to speak with one voice, by joining hands and thoughts. Even then, it turned out to be a devilishly strenuous exercise, partly because the distance was so considerable. The clenched eyelids of Philippa Eilhart quivered, Triss Merigold panted, and sweat beads ran down the high forehead of Keira Metz. Only the face of Margarita Laux-Antille expressed no fatigue. The small room plunged into semi-lit darkness, suddenly, a mosaic of light began to dance along the dark wood paneling.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"I, Philippa Eilhart, the mistress of this castle, as hostess and instigator of this meeting will handle the introductions. To my right, Margarita Laux-Antille, the head of the Academy of Aretuza. To my left, Triss Merigold, of Maribor, and Keira Metz, of Carreras. Next, we have Sabrina Glevissig, of Ard Carraigh and Sheala Tancarville of Creyden, representing Kovir. Then Francesca Findabair, known as Enid an Gleanna, the current ruler of the Valley of Flowers.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"Even if it is a game, let's put our trust in it.' 'And if this is provocation?' 'You know better than I the people involved in this.' Enid an Gleanna reflected. 'Sile de Tansarville,' she said at last, 'is a secretive recluse, she has no political connections. Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"The magicians from the north were beautiful, charming and sparkled with jewellery, but in their eyes, gently emphasized by makeup, there was no hint of either drugs or nymphomania. None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"It became immediately clear that her hopes were going to be dashed. Margarita m clearly wished to speak with her, Philippa quickly pulled her to the other end of the hall. Triss Merigold, who approached her was accompanied by Francesca. The elf monitored the conversation without embarrassment. But Yennefer saw the anxiety in Triss's eyes and she was sure had the conversation had no witnesses it would have been full of useless pleas for help.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"But I never questioned her abilities.' 'She will tell everything!' Sabrina Glevissig shouted. 'Everything about the Lodge! She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Margarita
"Have you ever had a horse called Roach? No. The Geralt said after a moment's thought. I have not. Hurry your lazy Pegasus, Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Roach, who was frightened, stamped and danced. Pegasus kept an imperturbable calm. Geralt! Yelled Dandelion, trying to outshout another thunder clap, rolling through the forest like a giant wagon. Let us go!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"We do not have much time, but there is always a little time to haggle! What the devil? Dandelion growled behind Geralt. Come closer, gentlemen elves, cried the man in the hat. Without fear, I'm your man.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"To trade with? Well, come here, under the beechwood, it will not fall on your heads so much! Geralt was not surprised by the mistake. He and Dandelion were wrapped in grey cloaks that had belonged to elves. He himself wore a doublet given to him by the Dryads, patterned with the leafy motifs favoured by elves, his face was partially covered by his hood and he was sitting on a horse with reins that were typically elven and characteristically decorated.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He himself wore a doublet given to him by the Dryads, patterned with the leafy motifs favoured by elves, his face was partially covered by his hood and he was sitting on a horse with reins that were typically elven and characteristically decorated. As for Dandelion the dandy, he had already been mistaken a few times for an elf or half-elf, especially since he had started wearing his hair to his shoulders and occasionally used curling irons. Watch out,  Geralt muttered, dismounting. You are an elf. Do not open your mouth unnecessarily.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"If they were captured by the military, hawkers could not count on mercy, so they did not to show it to others. If someone crossed their path who they could sell to the soldiers, they reached for their crossbow or knife without hesitation. Geralt and Dandelion were not in very good position, but fortunately the hawkers had taken them for elves. Geralt tightened his hood around his face and began wondering what to do when they were discovered. What bad weather.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"There is no good and bad weather, just as there's no bad money eh, eh! Understand me elf? Geralt nodded. Dandelion grunted something vaguely from behind his hood. Fortunately, the contemptuous dislike elves had for conversing with people was well known and surprised nobody.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Hey, seidhe, get off my wagon! Dandelion fearfully withdrew his hand from the canvas, and pulled his hood further over his eyes. For the umpteenth time, Geralt cursed the bard's curiosity. Mir'me vara. Dandelion muttered, raising his hand apologetically.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Come here then. Watch out, Dandelion. The Geralt whispered, discreetly undoing his jacket buckle. It thundered. The hawker approached the rider, naively hoping for the transaction of his life.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"One of the horsemen ran to the cart, threw the reins around the driver's neck, and tightened them, another rushed forward, and finished the job with a dagger. One rider quickly raised his crossbow to shoulder height, aiming for Dandelion. Geralt however, was already holding a sword he had pulled from the dealer's wagon. Seizing the weapon by the middle of the blade, he threw it like a javelin. The pierced bowman fell from his horse, still with an expression of boundless astonishment on his face.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Without warning, the leg that had been treated at Brokilon refused to obey him. The man on the ground who was about to knock him out with an axe, suddenly uttered a groan and staggered, as if someone had pushed him. Before falling, the Geralt saw an arrow with long feathers stuck deep into the side of the attacker. Dandelion yelled. It was drowned out by the thunder.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Milva approached, pulling her arrow from the dead horseman. Thank you. The Geralt said. Dandelion, this is Milva Barring. Thanks to her we are still alive.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Who is he? The archer wiped the tip on some wet leaves, and put the arrow back into her quiver. A friend of yours Geralt? Yes. He's called Dandelion, he's a poet.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Milva cleared her throat softly. The dark blue eyes of the prisoner, narrowed from the constant dripping of rain drops, now widened. Geralt leaned over and cut the loop binding his left arm. Look, Dandelion,  he said, grabbing the wrist and raising the released hand. You see this scar on his hand?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They had no other choice. Before them the battle raged, and the forest behind them was on fire. It is not difficult to guess,  Geralt finally, but unwillingly decided to answer Dandelion's question. The men on horseback are Nilfgaardians. And the foot soldiers?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"As soon as she left, Dandelion proceeded to vent his curiosity, which the Brokilon archer had aroused in him. That girl certainly likes a bit of action,  he muttered. You're lucky, you have a gift for meeting these kinds of women, Geralt. Slender and graceful, she walks as if she's dancing. A bit too narrow in the hips for my taste, and her shoulders are a little broad, but still feminine, ah yes feminine ...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"You would not find many competitors in archery tournaments. Lies, lies. I've read,  Dandelion flashed a look at Geralt,  that the best archers are Zerrikanian, those of the Steppe clans. Some reportedly cut their right breast, so that they do not get in the way when tightening their arches. The bust, they say, falls into the path of the chord.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Let's leave it. Ok? Dandelion opened his mouth, but Geralt did not give him time to speak. The girl,  he said, his voice becoming more agitated. Was not kidnapped after all, by a dragon or an evil sorcerer, she was not bought from pirates for a ransom.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"On the contrary, she sleeps on damask sheets, eats on silver plates, wears silk and lace, adorned with jewellery, and soon a crown. In short, she's happy. And an evil Geralt, who once accidentally put alot of harm in her way, is determined to spoil, destroy, to trample her happiness, with his shoes full of holes, which he inherited from some elf. Yes? That is not what I meant,  grumbled Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"That is not what I meant,  grumbled Dandelion. He's not talking to you. Milva emerged suddenly from the darkness, and after a moment's hesitation she sat down next to the Geralt. That was for me. These were my words that I hurt him so much with, the words that I spoke in anger, not thinking...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The number of dead was impossible to determine, or even to approximate. To get rid of them hastily, not only were arrows, swords and lances used, but also lumberjack equipment they had found on site - axes, saws and long handsaws. There were other images, but Geralt, Dandelion and Milva no longer remembered them. They had expelled them from memory. They became indifferent.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They were alone among the trees in the forest. Or so they thought. Geralt first heard the whinny of a horse following them. With a stony face, he turned Roach. Dandelion opened his mouth, but Milva passed him a silent gesture, she took her bow from the quiver on her saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He saw that they were waiting for him and stopped his horse, a chestnut stallion. They stood there frozen in silence, which was broken only by the sound of rain. I forbade you to follow us,  said the Geralt finally. The Nilfgaardian, who Dandelion last saw in a coffin, was wet from the rain and his eyes were hidden by his soaked hair. The poet barely recognized him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He was clad in chain mail, a leather jacket and overcoat, without a doubt taken from one of the people killed next to the hawker's cart. Dandelion noted, however, the youth of his face, which was recognizable from their adventure near the beech, despite the beard that was just emerging from his chin. I have forbidden you to follow,  repeated the Geralt. I am forbidden,  finally admitted the youngster. He spoke without a Nilfgaardian accent.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"You're going in search of the girl, I want to help you. I need to help. This is crazy,  Geralt turned to Milva and Dandelion. He's suffering from insanity. We are dealing with a madman.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He will fit in with our company then,  Milva muttered. He will fit in perfectly. Think about his proposal, Geralt. sneered Dandelion. After all, he is a Nilfgaardian nobleman.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Must be that still not wed, that is why so jolly! Um-ta, um-ta, uhu-ha! Dandelion laughed suddenly, pulled out the lute from under his wet coat, and paying no attention to the hisses of Geralt and Milva, he plucked the strings and sang in a loud voice: In the grass can you see, wolf just limps along, Looking down, awful frown, crying like a dog. Why is this mighty beast so badly rampaged? Must be that, freshly wed or lately engaged!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"said Dandelion. Indeed, each dwarf was hauling a pack, under the weight of which more than one man or even a horse would have buckled quite quickly. Besides the usual bags and sacks, Geralt saw locked caskets, a copper cauldron and what looked like a little small chest of drawers. One was carrying on his back the wheel of a cart. The one walking at the head did not carry any luggage.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Or, woman, my apologies good lady! Hello, I am Zoltan Chivay. I'm Geralt,  the Geralt introduced himself after a moment's hesitation. The one who sang is Dandelion. And this is Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"In an instant, all of the luggage was piled in. After some thought, Zoltan Chivay ordered that there be room left for the children to sit. The command was carried out with hesitation – Geralt noticed that the refugees kept their distance from the dwarves and were reluctant to give up the children. Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The women also did not seem very keen to leave the company. This made it all the more strange that they behaved towards the dwarves with reserve and a certain dislike, mingled with fear, they hardly spoke at rest stops and stood on the sidelines. Geralt attributed the behavior of the women to the tragedy they had recently survived, but he suspected that the reason for their reserve could be the fairly liberal manners of the dwarves. Zoltan and his company swore obscenely and often and the parrot, Field Marshal Duda, had an even richer repertoire. They sang bawdy songs, valiantly supported by Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"said Dandelion. Percival Schuttenbach made his way to the cart and in the blink of an eye provided the required items. The Geralt winked at the company, then with all his strength began banging the spoon on the lid. Enough! Enough!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"You have to look for another way to Nilfgaard. If you want I will counsel you... No need,  Geralt rubbed his knee, which after a few days the pain had still not abandoned. Keep your advice, Zoltan. He found Dandelion playing cards with the cheering dwarves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He found Dandelion playing cards with the cheering dwarves. Without a word, he took the poet's sleeve and pulled him into the forest. Dandelion immediately realized what was going on, one look at the Geralt's face was enough. Oi parrot,  Geralt said quietly. Gossip.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"When you hear a strange noise, that you do not recognise, that'll be me. Percival, you lead. Geralt, you going with us? We'll all go. Dandelion dismounted.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'And that they do not follow in our tracks or those of our strange rear guard.' 'He is a Nilfgaardian.' Geralt clenched his teeth. 'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And hanging from an oak, too.' Zoltan waved his hand and walked to the tree. Dandelion who could not resist his curiosity, spurred on Pegasus, and went after the dwarf. Geralt, after a moment's reflection, followed them. Milva trailed after him. The crows that were feeding on the corpses reluctantly rose into the air, squawking and rustling their feathers.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And do not forget where you hid everything!' 'Rest assured.' 'Catch up to us when you can.' Zoltan tucked his hatchet into his belt and threw his backpack over his shoulder along with Sihil. 'We are crossing over O, then along the Chotla to Ina. Farewell.' 'Interesting.' Milva muttered to Geralt, when their weakened squad departed on the road, waving farewell to the four dwarves left behind. 'I wonder what was in those boxes, that they needed to bury them and mark the place. And so that none of us saw.' 'It's not our business.' 'I don't think,' Dandelion said softly while carefully guiding Pegasus among the fallen trunks, 'that the boxes contained clean underwear.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They turned back in silence. The women from Kernow walked with difficulty, stumbling and supporting the children, but none make a word of complaint. Milva rode alongside the Geralt, the little girl with the braids asleep in her arms. 'If I understand,' she said, 'something in those woods three years ago, almost ended your life. You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt. He decided that when the next time they camped he would box Dandelion's ears for his uncontrollable tongue. Knowing the poet, it would have no effect; especially considering Dandelion sung everything he knew.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They call it... Dammit, I forgot. Noose of fate?' 'The loop.' Geralt corrected her. 'The loop of destiny.' 'Ugh!' Dandelion spat, 'can you stop talking about relationships and ropes. Once an elf, from the valley of flowers foretold that I was going to hang from a gallows.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf. 'Oh, tonight will be a feast for the ghouls, I can feel it, oh we are going to give...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Oh yes, just to be sure...' 'Get in there and ask to borrow a fork.' 'Why a fork?' 'Why not?' The dwarf looked up at him, but finally decided to; he strode to the hut, knocked on the door frame and entered. He spent a long time inside, before he again appeared at the door. 'Geralt, Percival, Dandelion, come see something interesting. Well, go ahead, Regis has invited you.' The interior of the cabin was dark and filled with heavy, intoxication smells from bundles of herbs and spices hanging on the walls. The only furniture was a bed, also covered in herbs, and a crooked table, covered with countless glass, earthenware and porcelain bottles.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest. 'Are you deaf? The moonshine is made of mandrake.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'There is no need to fear. The mandrake is correctly cured, and the proportions are carefully selected and accurately weighed. For one pound of yeast I get five ounces of Alraune and only half an ounce of belladonna...' 'It is not about that.' Zoltan looked at the Geralt, he understood the point, he turned serious and carefully backed away from the stove. 'It is not that, Mister Regis, but about how much the Alraune costs. It is too expensive a drink for us.' 'Mandragora.' Dandelion whispered admiringly, pointing to the towering pile in a corner booth resembling small bulbs of sugar beets.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Here, poet.' 'Aaaach... Oh, wow excellent! Try it, Geralt.' 'For the host.' The Geralt bowed slightly towards Regis. 'Where are your manners, Dandelion?' 'I beg your forgiveness, gentlemen,' the alchemist said. 'I do not drink.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Give me the cup, Dandelion, because you're holding up the queue.' The cup started moving again. Everyone sat comfortably on the trampled ground. The Geralt hissed and swore under his breath. Carefully he straightened his leg as the knee had a stabbing pain in it again. He saw Regis looking at him intently.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I can not recommend any medication for soothing the pain. Especially narcotics. You're a Geralt; it would be unacceptable for your body.' 'So the best thing is your mandrake.' The Geralt raised the glass that Milva had filled and given to him, and drank to the bottom, then coughed until tears came to his eyes. 'Damn, I feel better.' 'I'm not sure,' Regis said with a tight-lipped smile, 'you are treating the disease properly. I remember you should cure the causes not the symptoms.' 'Not for this Geralt.' A ruddy faced Dandelion snorted.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'It is easy to fall into mannerisms and start using those words every day. The people around them then consider them a pompous fool.' 'Or by an alchemist.' Said Zoltan, pouring another cup. 'Or by a Geralt,' snorted Dandelion, 'who has been reading, in order to impress a certain sorceress. The sorceresses, gentlemen, do not go crazy for convoluted far-fetched tales. Am I right, Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Come on, tell us...' 'Skip a few rounds, Dandelion,' interrupted the Geralt coldly. 'Some of the alkaloids have started to act too quickly on you. You talk too much.' 'I might end up with those secrets of yours, Geralt.' Zoltan frowned 'Dandelion has told us nothing new. You can't avoid being a walking legend. The stories of your adventures are played in puppet theaters.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The story of you hunting a djinn, if my memory serves me.' 'I was in that one.' Boasted Dandelion. 'We had fun. I can tell you...' 'Tell it all.' Geralt got up. 'Don't forget to drink and exaggerate. I'm going for a walk.' 'Whoa,' said the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Milva frowned. Zoltan, forgetting that he already told everyone about the old fart, Hogg the Mahakam thane, started again. Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened. Regis also listened and even added comments, completely calm about being the only sober one among those present. Dandelion strummed his lute and sang.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep! He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"A terrible, deep, dark secret... No one can know about this, understand? Nobody!' 'I have not heard anything,' Zoltan said, looking boldly at the Geralt. 'It seems I have an earwig in my ear.' 'These earwigs are a real pest,' said Regis, pretending to poke in his ear. 'We travel to Nilfgaard...' Dandelion rested on the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The rest of the company, who had enjoyed the evening with the distillery, where not so fresh. The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They are calmer. Come on, it is time to be on our way.' *** The enlarged company now resembled a funeral procession, and move at the same rate. 'What do you think of their vampire?' Zoltan Chivay asked the Geralt. 'Do you believe their story?' 'I have not seen the victims. I can not say anything in advance.' 'It is obviously nonsense,' Dandelion said with conviction.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I intend to wait at the camp for Munro Bruys and the boys. Nor could it hurt to rest. And whatever killed the girl and the boy, better look out, because there will be a Geralt in the camp.' 'And while we're at it,' Geralt pursed his lips, 'I'll ask you not to go around telling everyone who I am and my name. This goes for you to, Dandelion.' 'As you wish.' The dwarf nodded. 'You have your reasons.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Holy men often dream of vagina dentata.' 'I bet its worse,' Dandelion replied, also in a whisper. 'He probably daydreams all the time about a normal one, without teeth. And the desire has risen to his brain.' 'And that deranged girl will pay for it.' 'Can we not find anyone,' growled Milva, 'who will stop this black fool?' Dandelion looked meaningfully and with hope towards the Geralt but Geralt avoided his gaze. 'And who else but this female witch is to blame for our current troubles and misery?' The priest continued to shout. 'Why, it was none other than the witches of Thanedd Island who betrayed our kings, assassinating the King of Redania!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"All a deafening roar and din. 'Our horses!' Milva yelled, sending kicks and punches around her. 'Our horses, Geralt! To me, quickly!' 'Geralt!' Dandelion screamed. 'Help!' The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Help!' The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it. Geralt grabbed Dandelion by the collar but was not carried away because he managed to latch onto the wagon, which the girl accused of witchcraft was tied to. The wagon jerked suddenly and moved from its place, the Geralt and the poet crashed to the ground. The girl shook her head and stared laughing hysterically. The wagon slowly drifted away, the laughter was lost among the general roar.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The gnome with a quick movement pulled up the back of the priest's robe, the dwarf armed with pincers pulled from the fire a burning horseshoe and threw it down the pants of the priest. Released from Laabs grip, the priest rushed forward like a comet with a smoking tail, and his screams were drowned in the roar of the crowd. Geralt saw the mayor, gnome and dwarf go to congratulate each other for their success, when they fell straight into the next wave of the mob fleeing in panic. Everything disappeared in clouds of dust, the Geralt could see nothing more, He had no time to look anyway as he was busy saving Dandelion, who had been knocked over by a pig running blind. When Geralt bent to lift the poet, someone knocked a ladder onto his back from a passing wagon.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"When he finally managed to free himself, a wagon overturned with a crash, three sacks of wheat flour, costing a crown a pound fell onto the Geralt. The sacks burst and the world was drowned it white clouds. 'Get up, Geralt!' yelled the troubadour.' Get up, damn it!' 'I can't,' gasped the Geralt, blinded by the valuable flour and grabbing with both hands his knee which was immobilized with pain. 'Save yourself, Dandelion...' 'I won't leave you!' From the western edge of the camp they heard gruesome screams mixed with the sounds of galloping hooves and the neighing of horses. The yelling and hoof beats intensified, metal struck metal it sounded like a pieces of iron colliding with a bell.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Hide under the wagon, Dandelion, otherwise we'll be trampled!' 'Do not move...' whined the poet clamped to the earth. 'Let's stay in place... I've heard that horses never step on a man lying on the...' 'I'm not sure,' Geralt gasped, 'if the horses have heard about this. Under the wagon! Quick!' At that moment, one of the horses who did not know about proverbs kicked him in the head in passing.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Both were hold the reins of horses, from their saddles hung spears and shields. 'The miller or the devil?' The other soldier shrugged. Dandelion, Geralt saw, did not take his eyes off of the shields. He too had long since noticed that on the shields were lilies. The emblem of the Kingdom of Temeria.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Get up, both of you! Hey, this white one has a sword!' 'Drop the sword!' shouted the other soldier, calling over others. 'Drop the sword on the ground or I'll put a spear through you!' Geralt obeyed. He felt a ringing in his head. 'Who the devil are you?' 'Travellers.' said Dandelion.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Listen to you lot.' From the circle of archers on horseback came a detachment of light cavalry led by some men dressed in heavy armor and helmets with proud plumes on them. Dandelion looked at the approaching knights, wiped the flour from his clothes then spit into his hands and tousled his hair. 'You, Geralt, remain silent.' He warned. 'I will speak. These are knights.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Hey, out of the way, lackey, move! I would speak with your masters!' The soldiers looked at him doubtfully, but raised their spears and reluctantly parted. Dandelion and Geralt walked towards the knights. The poet walked proudly and with lordly mien, little suited to somebody covered in flour. 'Halt!' shouted one of the knights.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"A black column flanked by two griffins heads? The Paperbrock family coat of arms, if I'm not mistaken and in such matters I am rarely wrong. The black column, so they say, reflects a savvy member of the family.' 'Shut up, dammit.' Geralt moaned. 'I'm the famous poet Dandelion!' boasted the bard, ignoring him. 'Surely, you've heard of me.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"However, he did not rejoice. He imagined the journey differently. They arrived at a place at a time where Dandelion was horse from cursing mixed with cries for mercy, and the pain in Geralt's elbows and knees had become a veritable torture, severe enough to make the Geralt begin to consider radical, though desperate action. They reached a military camp, scattered around a half-burned and ruined fortress. They were led past campfires and tents decorated with pennants of chivalry, surrounding a large bustling fairground by a huge, scorched palisade.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I know him. Removed his bindings. And the other one too.' 'Are you certain, Count?' 'It was an order, Knight Paperbrock.' 'And you didn't think that I might come in useful, right?' Dandelion muttered to Geralt, rubbing his numb wrist where they had been bound. 'So now you know. My reputation precedes me, everywhere I am known and honoured.' Geralt made no comment as he was busy massaging his own wrists, sore knees and elbows.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"We need to get under way.' 'But, please do not feel uneasy.' Daniel Etcheverry smiled. 'It is a simple soldier's meal. Venison, hazel grouse, fruits, truffles...' 'To decline,' Dandelion swallowed and measured the Geralt with a significant glance, 'would be a grave insult. Let us go, my lord. This is your tent, the blue and gold?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"At the engagement of Princess Pavetta. It was fifteen years ago, but I have a good memory. And you, bastard Geralt, do you remember me?' 'I remember.' Geralt said and obediently let the soldiers bind his hands. *** Daniel Etcheverry, Count of Garramone, tried to intercede for Geralt and Dandelion, when the soldier had settled them on chairs in the Marshal's tent. When the soldiers left at Vissegerd's order, the Count resumed his efforts.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Any wizard who was on Thanedd. And the Redanian Chancellor, Count Sigismund Dijkstra...' Dandelion stopped suddenly, remembering that Dijkstra was completely unsuitable as a defence witness in this case, and invoking the wizards of Thanedd to improve their position was not a good idea either. 'It is also an absurdity,' he continued talking loudly and quickly, 'accusing Geralt of kidnapping Ciri from Cintra. Geralt found the girl after the massacre of the city, wandering and hid her from others, Nilfgaard agents that were looking for her. I myself was captured by these agents and subjected to torture, to confess where he had hidden Ciri!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And then I wouldn't be so sure of the loyalty of your army.' Vissegerd covered the distance between him and Dandelion in two steps and grabbed him by the front of his shirt and lifted him from the chair. The face of the Marshal which was a moment ago calm was now flushed a heraldic red. Geralt started to strongly worry about the health of his friend, when suddenly an Adjutant rushed in and excitedly started announcing that urgent and important news had been brought back by a patrol. Vissegerd released Dandelion, knocked over the chair and left. 'Uff...' groaned the poet, shaking his head and neck.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
But I do not react. Because I am a soldier. Do you understand my lords?' 'Yes.' said Geralt. 'No.' said Dandelion. 'Vissegerd is the commander of this unit which is part of the Temerian army.,Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I'm going to support him in proving that Ciri is a bastard and has no rights to the throne. I will not resist the Marshal, or his decisions and orders. On the contrary, I will support him.' The Geralt twisted his lips into a smile. 'You see Dandelion? The Count never for a moment took us for spies, otherwise we wouldn't have been granted such a thorough explanation.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Vissegerd,' he said quietly, 'is furious. You had bad luck falling into his hands. Especially you, Sir Geralt. I will try Mister Dandelion...' He was interrupted by the entrance of Vissegerd, still red and angry as a bull. The Marshal approached the table, slammed his baton on it and deposited a map atop it, then turned to Geralt and drilled him with his eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'The imperial cavalry struck the camp, and then from the south your army attacked. Probably Temerian.' 'If the fighting is over then we must go back there. We need to look for the Geralt, Dandelion and the others.' 'It will be wiser to wait until nightfall.' 'This is a horrible place,' she said softly, squeezing her bow. 'Grim and chilling. Not even a breeze moves through here, but something keeps making noises in the bushes...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"You are not alone, I can see.' 'You see well,' Milva let go of Cahir's arm, who had already reached for his sword. 'I am not alone but the same cannot be said about yourself. Regis, where is the Geralt? Dandelion? And the rest?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Among the reeds...' 'Then we head south, following the course of the Chotla. Without delay. Before midnight we must be in Armeria.' 'What about the Geralt and the poet? Do they live?' 'They live. But they are in trouble.' 'What trouble?' 'It is a long story.' *** Dandelion groaned, trying to turn around and put himself in a more comfortable position.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Because we are to be executed publicly at dawn, when the entire army has gathered. For propaganda.' Dandelion was silent. Geralt heard him sniff regretfully. 'You still have a chance to escape,' he said to appease him. 'Vissegerd wants to carry out his private vendetta against me, but he has nothing against you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Secondly, I witness a personal vendetta, he will not leave me alive. No, brother, we'll swing together.' 'Stop, Dandelion. Stay quietly and think of a plan.' 'What plan, dammit?' 'Anything.' The speech of the poet prevented the Geralt from concentrating. He needs something. He expected at any moment the woodshed would be invaded by Temerian military intelligence, who would certainly be working for Vissegerd.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Second, because we lie bound in a shed which is located in the center of a camp of an army of several thousand people.' 'And the third reason? You mentioned three.' 'Third,' he replied wearily, 'the limit of miracles for this month has already been exhausted when the women of Kernow found their missing husbands.' *** 'There,' the surgeon said, pointing out the glowing dots of campfires. 'There is the fort of America, the current troop camp for the Temerian army concentrated in Mayena.' 'The Geralt and Dandelion are imprisoned there?' Milva stood in her stirrups. 'Ha, it is so dark... There will be crowds of armed people around and guards.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'So we have time to talk. Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'No one else stinks so... Where are you? I cannot see you...' 'Quiet.' The medallion stopped vibrating, Geralt heard a sigh of relief from the poet and immediately after heard the sound of a knife cutting through rope. A moment later, Dandelion groaned with pain caused by the circulation being restored to his limbs, he tried to supress the groans by biting his fist. 'Geralt,' The fuzzy, shaky shadow of the surgeon came near him and immediately cut the ropes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Milva is waiting there with horses.' 'Help me get up...' He stood up on one leg, then the second, biting his fist. Dandelion's circulation had had time to return to normal. The Geralt, after a moment, was also ready. 'How do we get out?' the poet suddenly asked. 'The guards at the door are snoring, but they...' 'They won't' interrupted Regis in a whisper.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Go. Good luck.' 'And you?' 'Do not worry about me. Don't wait for me or look back.' 'But...' 'Dandelion,' the Geralt hissed. 'He said not to worry about him, didn't you hear?' 'Go,' repeated Regis. 'Good luck.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Do you understand me?' 'Perfectly. Do not waste time.' The guard slept in picturesque poses, snoring and muttering. None of them stirred when Geralt and Dandelion slipped through the open door. None of them reacted when the Geralt unceremoniously pulled off two heavy homespun cloaks. 'This is no mere sleep,' Dandelion whispered.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He kept repeating to himself that there was nothing surprising about any of this –in the middle of a busy night two people wouldn't be noticed, they could only be threatened if someone raised the alarm after finding the guards sleeping at the woodshed. Now, however, they approaching the perimeter where sentries necessarily had to be vigilant. It was while leaving the camp that the Geralt remembered that there was in Vissegerd's command the scourge of desertion and he was sure that the guards were ordered to give careful attention to any who wished to leave the camp. The moon gave enough light so that Dandelion did not have to grope. The Geralt could see in this light as well as in the day, so they managed to avoid two mounted soldiers while waiting in the bushes for the patrol to pass by.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The low and sinister grove of alders was tempting because it would allow them to hide. But since the world began, soldiers, when they came to perform their guard duties lay down among bushes, so they could sleep in shifts and also see the enemy as well as monitor their own annoying officers in case they passed by during an unexpected inspection. Geralt and Dandelion had barely approached the alder woods when dark silhouettes appeared in front of them. And a sharpened spears. 'The password!' 'Cintra!' Dandelion blurred without hesitation.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Okay. The price is the same as yesterday.' Dandelion clenched his teeth audibly. Geralt had a chance to assess the situation. But the assessment yielded a poor result. 'Come,' urged the soldier.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And call the patrol!' No one was listening because all the men were on their knees. Some were digging through leaves searching for the doubloons, others were dragging off Dandelion's other boot. Now or never, thought Geralt, then punch the commander in the jaw as he fell he kicked him in the side of the head. The men gathering gold did not even notice. Dandelion without encouragement jumped to his feet and dashed off through the bushes.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Raise the alarm! Nilfgaard!' The rider leading the patrol chasing them, looked forward, he shouted in fright and tried to turn his horse around. But Geralt decided that he had had enough of the Cintra's lions and Temeria's lilies. He jumped up and skilfully knocked the soldier from his saddle. 'Get on, Dandelion!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The swarm of Nilfgaardians approaching them was now a much greater threat that Vissegerd and his army, so they galloped along the ring of guard posts surrounding the camp, trying to get as far possible from the lines that could flare up at any moment when the two armies clashed. The Nilfgaardians, however, were close and saw them. Dandelion yelled, Geralt looked back and saw as the dark wall of Nilfgaardians started to stretch out riders towards them like black tentacles. Without hesitation, they turned the horse towards the camp, overtaking the fleeing guards. Dandelion yelled again, but this time it was unnecessary.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The Geralt had also seen the cavalry rushing from the side of the camp. Vissegerd's army, stirred by the alarm, had mounted their horses in a time worthy of admiration. Geralt and Dandelion found themselves trapped. There was no way out. The Geralt changed direction again and forced the horse to gallop with all its might, trying to escape from the swiftly narrowing gap between the rock and the hard place.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The Geralt changed direction again and forced the horse to gallop with all its might, trying to escape from the swiftly narrowing gap between the rock and the hard place. When it seemed like they would succeed in escape, the night air was suddenly filled with the sound of whistling arrows. Dandelion yelled, this time in pain and dug his fingers into Geralt's ribs. The Geralt felt something warm splatter on his neck. 'Hold on!' he caught the poet's arm and pressed him hard against his back.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I'm dying!' 'Hold on!' The hail of arrows and bolts, which buried the two armies and which had proved so fatal for Dandelion, had also become a his salvation. The armies, coming under fire, had lost their momentum and the gap between them provide some breathing room, enough to get both riders and the horse out of the trap. Geralt mercilessly forced the stallion to galloping further, because although it loomed before them they could still hear the rumble of hooves from behind. The horse grunted, stumbled, but they might have kept running and escaped had Dandelion not groaned and suddenly slipped from the rump of the horse, pulling the Geralt from the saddle. Geralt unintentionally pulled on the reins, the horse reared up and they were both tossed to the ground landing in a bush.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"But despite the return of the battle, the Nilfgaardian pursuers had not forgotten about them. Three horsemen galloped in their direction. The Geralt stood up, a feeling of cold rage welling inside of him. He jumped in front of the pursuers, trying to divert their attention from the unconscious Dandelion. He did not want to sacrifice himself for his friend.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"head... Nailed in the head...' 'Don't talk nonsense! Damn, you were lucky,,, It's only a scratch...' 'I'm bleeding...' Geralt took off his jacket and tore off a sleeve. The tip of the arrow had scratched Dandelion's ear, leaving a cut that reached to his temple. The poet, every now and again touched the wound with his shaking hands, and then looked at the blood covering his hands and sleeves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Dandelion, it's just a scratch... Get up, we need to be on our way...' The night battle raging on the prairie was at its height, the clang of iron, the neighing of the horses and the cries all gathered strength. Geralt quickly grabbed two of the Nilfgaardians horses, but they only needed one. Dandelion stood up, but immediately sat down heavily, groaned and sobbed wretchedly. The Geralt picked him up, shook him until he came around and helped him climb into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"*** 'Dawn will be here soon,' Milva said not looking at the sky but at the glossy surface of the river. 'The catfish chase the salmon. But there is no sign of the Geralt or Dandelion. Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion. 'Pah...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He went to the hose and pulled from a sheath under the saddle a long sword. 'Get away from him,' he snapped, standing next to the surgeon. 'The blood smells good,' Regis repeated without looking at the Geralt, 'I do not smell an infection, which in the case of a wound in the head could be fatal. The arteries and veins have not been affected... Now I need to cut you.' Dandelion wailed and gasped violently.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Now I need to cut you.' Dandelion wailed and gasped violently. The sword in the Geralt's hand quivered, the light reflecting from the river flashed across its surface. 'I will give you a few stitches,' Regis said, still not paying any attention to the Geralt or his sword. 'Be brave, Dandelion.' Dandelion was courageous. 'I'm finished,' Regis finished his treatment.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The archer gasped when she saw how the surgeon's eyes gleamed in the darkness, with a cat's light. 'Well, go on,' Regis said calmly. 'Push.' 'Geralt,' Dandelion moaned from the floor, fully conscious, 'Are you crazy? He saved us from the gallows... He healed my head...' 'He saved us and that girl in the camp.' Milva gently reminded him.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"How much exactly?' 'Fuck off, Regis.' 'Of course. But before that, my valuation, please.' 'An ordinary vampire I would look at the equivalent of a good horse and saddle. But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The day broke with a red sun, which shone blindingly off of the water lily covered lakes; they turned towards the spot where one of the many branches of the Ina flowed into the Yaruga. The now rode through the dark gloomy forests, where the trees grew directly from the duckweed from the green marshes. Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They made a trap out of wicker found in the boat and waded around the shore with sticks beating the seaweed, trying to propel the fish into the trap. The poet was feeling better already and walked with his head bandaged heroically, proud as a peacock. The Geralt was thoughtful and angry. Dandelion and Milva pulled the wicker trap from the water and started to curse, because instead of carp, they had caught little fish among the weeds. The Geralt stood.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"So I'm going alone.' 'Having disposed of cumbersome baggage,' Dandelion nodded.' The ball and chain hindering your march. In other words, me.' 'And me,' Milva added, looking away. 'Listen,' said Geralt, much calmer now. 'This is a personal matter. It does not concern you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Alone.' 'I'm going,' Milva rose resiliently. 'Do you think that would ask you? To the devil with you, Geralt. Come on, Dandelion, let's go find some food. I'm hungry and listening to this drivel has made me feel sick.' Geralt turned his head.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Geralt, help her.' 'I can handle it,' Milva growled irritably. 'I can do without his help. He deals with personal issues, I wouldn't dare disturb him!' Geralt turned his head, pretending not to hear. Dandelion and the vampire had efficiently cleaned the fish. 'This will be a thin soup,' Dandelion said, hanging the cauldron over the fire.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Now throw away the slops, Cahir,' Dandelion ordered. 'It smells good, yum, yum. There is no need for more wood, Geralt! What are you doing with that spoon? I doesn't need more stirring!' 'Don't shout.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I didn't know.' 'Ignorance,' Regis smiled. 'Is not an excuse for thoughtless actions. When one doesn't know or is in doubt, it is good to seek advice...' 'Shut up, Vampire!' Geralt stood up and turned his back. Dandelion snorted. 'Look at him, you've offended him again.' 'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I say,' gasped Milva. 'That it was a silly thing to have soup, Dandelion.' 'Certainly,' Regis agreed. 'What do you say, Geralt?' 'I say – thank you.' The Geralt stood up with effort, rubbed his knee, which began to bite back with pain. 'Is that enough? Or do you need a fanfare?' 'It is always like that with him,' the troubadour waved his hand.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"In Angren. On this side of the Yaruga. I speak of the circle of Druids, who are located in the forests of Caed Dhu.' 'Let us set off without delay!' 'Did any of you,' Geralt finally spoke, upset 'not consider it appropriate to ask me my opinion?' 'You?' Dandelion turned around. 'But you have no idea what to do. Even the soup that you ate, you owe to us.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head. 'Comrades in arms! A team of heroes!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Or I'll grab a stick and tan you all, bastards! I said in order. Grandfather Pogwizd will tell us about the Geralt and how he wandered with Dandelion, Milva...' 'Yes!' Nimue squeaked again. 'About Milva. I want to hear about Milva!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Bad luck or fate? The cranes blew a trumpeting call. *** Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy rode at the head of the procession mounted on a Nilfgaardian bay captured by the Geralt in Armeria. The stallion, although at first it was bothered by the vampire and his herbal scent, soon became accustomed and caused little trouble unlike Roach who kicked like he was being bitten by horseflies. Behind Regis and Geralt rode Dandelion on Pegasus with his head bandaged like a war hero.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Don't be in such a rush to get back to camp. We want to talk to you in private, here, me and Milva. It's ...Well, about Regis.' 'Aha,' The Geralt lay down his arm full of brushwood. 'You're starting to be afraid? It is about time.' 'Shut up,' Dandelion raised his eyebrows.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"He is our companion; there should be no misunderstanding between us or mutual mistrust and fear. Let us return to camp. Help me with the wood.' 'Geralt?' 'I'm listening, Dandelion.' 'If... Well, I was wondering, theoretically... If...' 'I honestly don't know,' he replied sincerely.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"If...' 'I honestly don't know,' he replied sincerely. 'I don't know if I could kill him. I would rather not have to try.' *** Dandelion took the Geralt's advice to heart and decided to clarify the ambiguities and dispel the doubts. He did so as soon as they set out on their journey. He did so with his characteristic tact.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'No. In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I do not refer...' 'I do not drink blood,' Regis interrupted. 'For a long time now. I lost the habit.' 'How is it that you lost the habit?' 'The usual way.' 'I really don't understand...' 'Sorry, it is a personal matter.' 'But...' 'Dandelion,' the Geralt could not stand it anymore and turned in his saddle. 'Regis has just told you to fuck off. He just put it politely.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt. 'He doesn't. You do not need to confide or to explain.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Since then, I do not drink.' 'Nothing?' Dandelion said with curiosity, 'Nothing? Never? But if...' 'Dandelion,' Geralt raised his eyebrows slightly. 'Control yourself. And think, in silence.' 'Sorry,' grunted the poet.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Fear plays a part in the human psyche that is no less important than other emotional states. A psyche devoid of fear is a cripple psyche.' 'Imagine,' Dandelion said, recovering his composure, 'that I woke up without fear. Would I be a cripple?' Geralt for a moment thought that Regis would show his teeth and cure Dandelion of his putative disability, but he was wrong. The vampire had no inclination for theatrical gestures. 'I have spoken of fears rooted in the consciousness and the subconscious,' he said quietly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"' 'And we, as usual, are out of luck,' Dandelion nodded. 'Because we need to get to Caed Dhu, and the path leads straight through Angren, the focus of the timber wars. Damn, is there another way?' *** The same question, recalled the Geralt, staring at the sun setting over the Yaruga, I asked Regis once the thud of hooves ceased in the distance and we were finally able to continue on our way. *** 'Another way to Caed Dhu?' the vampire looked thoughtful. 'To avoid the armies, but also not go through the hills?",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"This method was suggested to me by my teacher. He did not like the first few. Then I insisted on taking the name Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde. Vesemir considered this to be ridiculous, pretentious and stupid. It seems that he was right.' Dandelion snorted loudly, and meaningfully, looking at both the vampire and the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'The girl is pregnant.' Cahir nodded as a sign that he had guessed. Dandelion was dumbfounded. Geralt bit his lip. 'In which month?' 'She refused, fairly impolitely, to give me a date, including the date of her last menstrual cycle. But I know this.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"As primitive tribes, adhering to shamanic taboo? It is obvious that only a woman could make such a decision, it is their inherent right! If Milva decides to...' 'Shut up, Dandelion,' the Geralt growled. 'Be so kind as to shut up.' 'Do you believe otherwise?' the poet raised his voice. 'Would you forbid...' 'Shut up, damn it, because I will not vouch for myself!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'You feel exactly as I do. But since you asked, I will answer. Yes, Geralt, that is what I need, and it is not me waiting for something.' 'Can you speak more clearly?' 'No, Dandelion,' said the vampire. 'I cannot be clearer. Especially since there is no need too.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"I thought that if it was really bad, I'd go back with him... And here we are – Dandelion is fine and I...' He voice broke suddenly. Geralt hugged her. And immediately knew that this was the gesture that she had been waiting for, that she so badly needed. The roughness and hardness of the archer from Brokilon had disappeared, instantly she was a trembling, delicate, softness of a frightened little girl.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Now go, please. Leave me alone. Go away, Geralt. Go away, before you shatter my world completely.' *** When they left at dawn, Milva was at the head of the company, calm and smiling. And riding behind her was Dandelion who began to strum his lute, while whistling a tune.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"And then in the air, arrows whistled. Some of them stuck into the side of the ferry, some flew higher and splashed into the water. Two flew straight at Dandelion, but the Geralt already with his sword in hand, jumped and with two quick blows, deflected the arrows. 'By the Great Sun,' Cahir gasped. 'He deflected them...",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river. The soldiers on the bank again raised a roar, and laid their hands on their bows, arrows began to whistle through the air and one of the horses whinnied wildly.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The horses continued to stamp and neigh, shaking the vampire and Dandelion, who were holding the reins. The riders on the shore shook their fists at them in a threatening manner. Geralt could distinguish among them a knight on a white horse, waving a sword and giving orders. After a moment the cavalcade rode back into the woods and galloped along the high edge of the bank. Their armour gleamed among the thickets.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The air began to howl with the sounds of feathered arrows. 'Take cover!' The ferryman's assistant suddenly coughed in an odd way and dropped his spar into the water. Geralt saw the arrowhead and four inches of the shaft protruding from his back. Cahir's chestnut reared on two legs and whinnied with pain, snorted and shook its neck that was pierced by an arrow, it knocked down Dandelion and jumped overboard. The other horses also whinnied and reared; the barge was shaking and pounding with hooves.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"This blood will fall on your heads...' 'Shut up and grab the spars!' On the left bank, closer now, near the edge of the river stood a line of riders Dandelion had identified as the Lyrian guerrillas. They shouted and waved their hands. Geralt saw among them a rider on a white horse. He was not sure, but it seemed to him that the rider was a woman. A blond woman in armour, but without a helmet.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"The bolt went through him from side to side. Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle. However, the actual slaughter the hail of bolts cause was among the horses.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I want him to stay with me...' A tear run down her cheek. Above them the bridge resonated with the boots of soldiers. 'Geralt!' Dandelion cried. The Geralt, seeing what the vampire was doing to Milva, turned his head in embarrassment. He saw soldiers in white jackets rushing along the bridge.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"Turn around!' 'The Nilfgaardians, sir!' cried the Landsknecht. 'It's a bloodbath! Let us pass!' 'Cowards!' Dandelion cried, climbing onto the bridge and emitting a voice Geralt had not heard before. 'Unworthy cowards! Rabbit hearts!",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"They are still fighting! Shame on him who does not go to their aid! Follow me!' 'Dandelion,' the Geralt hissed. 'Go back to the island. You have to help Regis get Milva to the left bank.",Baptism of Fire,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Welcome, Yennefer.' 'I had the privilege of filling two seats,' the melodiously golden-haired elf named Francesca said, clearly noting Philippa's astonishment. 'Here are my candidates. You all know Yennefer of Vengerberg. And Lady Ida Emean aep Sivney, Aen Saevherne of the Blue Mountains.' Ida Emean bowed her head with her red hair slightly, her flowing dress rustled. 'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"Please ladies take your seats.' Places at the round table – all except one – had been marked. Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"Well, she thought, because of it occurring it has created this Lodge. The devil knows how it will end, but it is to begin. 'Continue, Yennefer.' Philippa said. 'I have nothing more to say.' The black-haired sorceress pursed her lips. 'I repeat, it was Tissaia de Vries who ordered me to bring Ciri to Garstang.' 'It is easier to blame everything on the dead.' Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"Adalia was the first daughter of the Rogue, the following children almost certainly had no trace of the activator. The latent gene in Fiona was probably in her male descendants up to the third generation. But it has not disappeared and I know why.' 'Bloody hell.' Yennefer hissed through her teeth. 'I'm lost,' said Sabrina Glevissig, 'in the jungle of all this genetic genealogy.' Francesca drew a platter of fruit closer to her, stretched out her hand and muttered a spell. 'I apologize for this fairground show of telekinesis,' she smiled, and ordered a red apple to rise from the table.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"'This means that the culprit is Vilgefortz.' Sabrina banged her fist on the table. 'Not Emhyr but Vilgefortz, trickster, elegant scoundrel. He tricked Emhyr and us!' Yennefer took calming breaths. Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together. I understand everything.' 'And I don't understand anything!' Sabrina screamed out loud again.",Baptism of Fire,Yennefer,Sabrina
"This made it all the more strange that they behaved towards the dwarves with reserve and a certain dislike, mingled with fear, they hardly spoke at rest stops and stood on the sidelines. Geralt attributed the behavior of the women to the tragedy they had recently survived, but he suspected that the reason for their reserve could be the fairly liberal manners of the dwarves. Zoltan and his company swore obscenely and often and the parrot, Field Marshal Duda, had an even richer repertoire. They sang bawdy songs, valiantly supported by Dandelion. They spat, blew their noses in their fingers and farted loudly, which was usually followed by laughter, jokes and competitions.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"*** During one of their stops, Geralt and Milva chatted longer with Zoltan Chivay, the incorrigible and compulsive altruist. The dwarf was well informed about the course of the war or at least he gave that impression. The attack,  he replied, trying again and again to silence Field Marshal Duda, who was now swearing loudly,  Came from Drieschot. It began at dawn on the seventh day after Lammas. The Verdanian army marched with Nilfgaard because Verden, as you know, is now an Imperial protectorate.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"Dandelion dismounted. If its a trap, we'll be safer in a large group. I'll leave Field Marshal here. Zoltan took the parrot from his shoulder and handed it to Figgis Merluzzo. He may decide to suddenly launch his profanities at point bank range, and our stealth approach would go to hell.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"The western end of the old road was located in Brugge, the eastern in Temeria and the middle in Sodden, every kingdom devastated their part as they needed it. In response, Zoltan obscenely described a place where they could remove the kings and their politics. Field Marshal Duda added something offensive about the royal mothers. The further along they went, the worse it got. Zoltan's comparison to the donut and the jam turned out to be increasingly less relevant – the road looked like a yeast cake, which had been laboriously gouged of all its raisins and almonds.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"A ghoul did that.' 'Monsters?' Zoltan Chivay stopped and spat. 'A corpse eater?' 'Exactly. We will need to guard well at night.' 'KRR-rrwa mother!' Field Marshal Duda croaked. 'You took the word right out of my mouth, bird.' Zoltan frowned. 'So we have a dilemma.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"It slipped from the hands of the dwarves, rolling down the hit to the bottom of the ravine, where it shattered into pieces. 'Rrrrurr... Mother!' Field Marshal Duda croaked, creating a chorus counterpoint to Zoltan and his company. *** 'Truth be told,' Dandelion said, eyeing the remains of the cart and the luggage strewn about it. 'It was a happy accident.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"Behind them stomped Zoltan Chivay, leading his chestnut stallion by the bridle. The dwarf had found in the hut of the surgeon a gnarled piece of ash wood, which he was banging against the menhirs, as he passed he wished the long dead elves, eternal rest. For his part, Field Marshal Duda, who sat on his shoulder, shouted from time to time, but his curses somehow seemed tired and unconvincing. The least resistant to the effects of the mandrake proved to be Milva. She marched with great difficulty, she was sweaty, pale and irritated like a wasp.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"But, this is the fourth, we have no money.' 'So give us the horses.' 'Hey, Hey.' Milva's eyes narrowed ominously. 'Leave quickly peasant. Take care where you pass.' 'Krrrrwa mother!' croaked Field Marshal Duda. 'Oh the bird has hit the nail on the head,' Zoltan drawled while patting the axe in his belt. 'Know this peasants that I do not have the best opinions about the mothers of individuals who think only about profit, even if it is earned from the broken head of a fellow traveller.",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"motherfuckers!' 'Greetings, boys,' Geralt said as he came out from behind a pile of logs. 'I'm glad to see you alive and healthy. Even with the parrot.' 'Damn it!' Zoltan Chivay dropped his cards in surprise, after which he jumped to his feet so suddenly that Field Marshal Duda, who was on his shoulder, flapped his wings and shrieked with terror. 'The Geralt has found us! Or is he a mirage?",Baptism of Fire,Field,Zoltan
"I will tell you everything!' 'Of course you're going to tell me everything,' drawled the elf. 'Especially since the beginning is behind us and the beginning is always the hardest. Continue.' 'I had orders to force you to confess where you are hiding Rience, Vilgefortz and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach!' 'Amusing. You set a trap to ask me about Rience and Vilgefortz? What can I know about them?",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Come on, begin. Fast, neat and to the point.' 'The Emperor is convinced that those at Thanedd betrayed him. The traitor Vilgefortz Roggeveen, sorcerer. And his assistant, called Rience. And above all, Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
But instead the Emperor called Kalous. I mean Lord Skellen and Lord Vattier and ordered the capture of Cahir... and Rience and Vilgefortz... Everyone who might know something about the events on Thanedd had to be subjected to torture... And you too...,Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"But you will repeat everything to Vattier de Rideaux, word for word.' The spy nodded eagerly. 'In mid Blathe, that is, by your reckoning the beginning of June,' began the elf, 'The sorceress Enid an Gleanna, also known as Francesca Findabair, established contact with me. At her command there soon arrived to my commando unit a certain Rience, reportedly a factotum of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, also a sorcerer. In the deepest secrecy a plan of action was developed, aimed at eliminating a number of wizards at the Congress on the island of Thanedd. The plan was presented to me as an action that had the full support of the Emperor Emhyr, Vattier de Rideaux and Stefan Skellen, otherwise I would not have agrees to cooperate with the Dh'oine, sorcerers or not, because I have seen too many provocations in my life.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Rience had amulets which he used to cover the ship in magic mist. We sailed the boat into caverns beneath the island. From there we came to the basement under Garstang.' 'Already in the basement, we knew that something was wrong, Rience received some telepathic communication from Vilgefortz. We knew that when we began our march we would be entering into an on-going struggle. We were ready.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"We could not eliminate all of the king's witches and suffered big losses. Some of the magicians on our side were killed, others wanting to save their own skin, teleported away. At some point Vilgefortz disappeared, the Rience disappeared and soon after them Enid an Gleanna. The last disappearance I took as the definitive signal to retreat. I did not want to issue the order until the return of Cahir and his group, who had at the beginning of the action gone to perform his mission.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Even in the dungeons of Nastrog you would not have gotten more. Lies and fabrication, which I probably would have provided to your torturer, would have proved to be harmful to you, rather than help. I do not know anything more, in particular, I do not know the whereabouts of Vilgefortz and Rience, I also don't know whether to rightly suspect them of treason. And to tell you the truth, I know nothing about the princess of Cintra, neither true nor false. I have told you everything I know.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood. He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"I was compressed and packed in a box for a month and a half as a jade statue. And you expect me to thank you for that.' 'That would be nice.' Francesca Findabair replied coldly. 'At Thanedd there was a certain Rience who had made it a point of honour to set himself the task of giving you a slow and cruel death and Vilgefortz promised to make it possible. Rience travelled in search of you throughout Garstang. But he couldn't find you, because you were already a jade figure hanging around my neck.' 'I was a figurine for forty-seven days.' 'Yes.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"But here in the dungeon, The spell did not reach. I don't know why...' 'I know. The fire was not lit by Vilgefortz but by his handyman Rience or another sorcerer. Vilgefortz would not make such a mistake; we would have left us with nothing but black soot on the walls. Yes, he knows that fire purifies...",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Do you mock us, Philippa? First you demand that we keep this from our kings and our colleagues, which you have not seen fit to invite. And there sits Enid Findabair, by the grace of Emhyr var Emreis the reigning ruler of the elves of Dol Blathanna, who actively supports and arms Nilfgaard. That's not to say I'm not more amazed at the projection of a Nilfgaardian sorceress here in this room. Since when did the sorcerers of Nilfgaard cease to profess blind obedience and docile servility towards the Imperial power?",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"Sabrina finished quickly. Philippa, Triss and I, all three of us were at Sodden Hill. Emhyr will make us pay, as we will pay forThanedd, and for the entirety of our involvement. But this is just one of the reservations that stops me from agreeing to the declared political neutrality of the convention. Does participation in it mean the immediate resignation of the active and political, after all, service that we act in now with our kings?",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"To expect that we would immediately, on command, explain the mysteries and secrets that we ourselves have tried to unravel for centuries.' Francesca raised her hand and examined her rings. 'Interesting,' she said, 'and Philippa knows about the strange hobbies of Vattier and Skellen? And Emhyr var Emreis, whom they both serve.' 'It would be prudent to assume that she does not know.' Ida Emean looked keenly at the Queen. 'And to hide it at the meeting in Montecalvo of what we know, both to Philippa and the entire Lodge. It would not throw a good light on us...",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"But here is one obstacle... *** Aha, thought Triss Merigold, we finally begin to talk about what we started to. The sobering fact that Ciri is in Nilfgaard under Emhyr var Emreis's power. Far from the plans that are being established here... 'There is no question,' said Philippa, 'that Emhyr has hunted Ciri for a long time.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"'There is no question,' said Philippa, 'that Emhyr has hunted Ciri for a long time. Everyone thought that it was for a political marriage with Cintra and the seizure of a fief, which is the legal legacy of the girl. But we can not exclude the possibility that this was not about politics, but the Elder Blood gene, which Emhyr wants to introduce into the imperial line. If Emhyr knows that we want to fulfil the prophecy he may wish for the future Queen of the World to be born in Nilfgaard.' 'A correction,' Sabrina Glevissig interjected. 'This is not what Emhyr wants, but Nilfgaard's sorcerers.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"Now I get it.' 'So Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' Yennefer said quietly. 'She is not there.' 'She is not there.' Philippa Eilhart confirmed seriously. 'Emhyr was cheated, someone slipped him a doppelganger. I heard about this yesterday. However, I am glad Assire's confession confirms this.",Baptism of Fire,Emhyr,Philippa
"Zoltan Chivay licked his lips in response, and told her he was a master at preparing horsemeat, which infuriated Milva even more. They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"He cursed as he ran, because once again he felt the pain through his knee. Just behind him rushed Zoltan Chivay, seizing his sword wrapped in its skins on the cart. Percival Schuttenbach and the rest of the dwarves ran after them, armed with their clubs and at the back Dandelion followed, who'd been awakened by the screaming. From one side, Figgis and Munro appeared. Throwing their baskets of mushrooms down, both dwarves caught the fleeing children.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"What? Do not argue with a specialist Zoltan. said Dandelion. Percival Schuttenbach made his way to the cart and in the blink of an eye provided the required items. The Geralt winked at the company, then with all his strength began banging the spoon on the lid.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Despite this, they rode slowly. They followed the example of Milva, who immediately after leaving the forest, place a freckled little girl with braids into her saddle. Dandelion also seated a child on Pegasus, and Zoltan, took two on his chestnut stallion, as he walked alongside holding the reins. But the pace did not increase; the women of Kernow were in no condition to go faster. *** It was almost evening, when after hours of wandering among the gorges and ravines, Zoltan Chivay stopped and exchanged a few words with Percival Schuttenbach, after which he turned to the rest of the company.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Fen Carn, while I've never been here, if something dangerous had occurred, I would have heard about it.' No one made a comment, not even Field Marshal Duda. The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Oh yes, just to be sure...' 'Get in there and ask to borrow a fork.' 'Why a fork?' 'Why not?' The dwarf looked up at him, but finally decided to; he strode to the hut, knocked on the door frame and entered. He spent a long time inside, before he again appeared at the door. 'Geralt, Percival, Dandelion, come see something interesting. Well, go ahead, Regis has invited you.' The interior of the cabin was dark and filled with heavy, intoxication smells from bundles of herbs and spices hanging on the walls. The only furniture was a bed, also covered in herbs, and a crooked table, covered with countless glass, earthenware and porcelain bottles.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest. 'Are you deaf? The moonshine is made of mandrake.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Thank you, sir surgeon.' 'The pleasure is all mine.' The constantly topped up vessel was circulated among those present and provoked a good mood, relaxation and talking. 'I often used to hear, that the mandrake is a vegetable with great magical power.' Said Percival Schuttenbach. 'You can say that again,' Dandelion confirmed, emptied the cup, shook his head and continued. 'Many ballads are composed on the subject. Sorcerers add mandrake to elixirs, which provide them with eternal youth.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"We want to drink, but it drips like a running nose.' 'The distillate is cool enough. The spirit will come out warm.' 'Never mind that, the night is cold.' The liquor stimulated conversation. Dandelion, Zoltan and Percival were flushed, their voices had changed even more – in the case of the poet and the gnome it came out a lisp. They grew hungry and chewed on cold horse meat and horseradish, which was in the hut in decent supply. The alchemist collected a mass of roots as strong as the liquor and they were reduced t tears.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"It is not unusual beautiful women are hard to see, The more proud the tree, the high you have to climb it. 'Idiot.' Milva commented. Dandelion continued unfazed. A girl can be a tree but a fool who is not, should get an ax and end the problem. 'The grail...' Percival Schuttenbach muttered.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"'He dreams of a heap of diamonds. Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep! He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots. All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring. However, when the mist had been dispelled and the red ball of the sun blazed on the crown of the pines and larches of Fen Carn, the company was on its way, marching swiftly among the tombs. Regis led, behind him followed Percival and Dandelion, singing a song about three sisters and an iron wolf. Behind them stomped Zoltan Chivay, leading his chestnut stallion by the bridle. The dwarf had found in the hut of the surgeon a gnarled piece of ash wood, which he was banging against the menhirs, as he passed he wished the long dead elves, eternal rest.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"I bet they are sitting somewhere and playing cards!' 'We must get fodder for the horses,' Milva said. 'And drink. Let's go down to the river.' 'Maybe we will be able to find some hot food.' Dandelion said. 'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry. 'Did you find something to eat?' The gnome blew his nose and wiped his fingers on the fleece of a sheep returning from the river.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Such a procedure makes sense for wolves, allowing the individual to survive healthier and stronger. But among intelligent races such selection usually allows the dominant and biggest bastards to survive. Analyze this how you want.' Dandelion objected violently, and started to protest and bring forth cases of price gouging and utilitarianism by dwarves, but Zoltan and Percival drowned him out by imitating the sounds of a raspberry, which was considered by both races as a sign of contempt for the opponent's arguments in the dispute. An end was put to the dispute by the sudden appearance of a group of peasants led by the famous vampire hunter, the old man in the felt hat. 'We are here about Clog.' said one of the peasants.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Did you see?' 'No. I have not ruled out that during the fighting they were cut down or trampled by horses. There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Percival
"Geralt first heard the whinny of a horse following them. With a stony face, he turned Roach. Dandelion opened his mouth, but Milva passed him a silent gesture, she took her bow from the quiver on her saddle. The intruder emerged from the bushes. He saw that they were waiting for him and stopped his horse, a chestnut stallion.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"In silence. Not looking back. I must be getting old,  he muttered after a while, when Roach had caught up with Milva's black bay. I am beginning to have scruples. Aww well, it happens when you're old,  the archer looked at him with compassion.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking. Zoltan Chivay whistled on his fingers, signaling it was time to end the salvaging, then he cast a professional eye over Roach, Pegasus, and Milva's black bay. Your horses,  he said, wrinkling his nose with an air of disapproval. They are useless.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"First, she was seized in a frenzied, panicked crowd, then the way was barred by rushing wagons and then she plunged into a flock of woolly sheep, which she waded through like a snow drift. She eventually jumped into the mud and reeds on the shore of the Chotla, which saved her form the swords of the Nilfgaardians who were mercilessly everyone, giving no quarter even to women or children. Milva threw herself into the water and escaped to the other side, partly wading, partly by swimming on her back among the corpses being washed away. She continued her chase. She remembered the direction the peasants went in, who stole Roach, Pegasus, the chestnut stallion and her own black.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"Or rather a sluggish run, which Pegasus considered a gallop. But even this pseudo-gallop was enough to catch the horse thieves, since their escape was slowed by a more unusual horse: Roach, the Geralt's bay mare, which Geralt had promised more than once to replace with a donkey, mule or even a goat. Milva overtook the thieves when the unskilful rider pulling on Roach's reins fell to the ground and the rest of the peasants jumped from their saddles, trying to tame the frisky, kicking mare. They were so busy that they did not noticed when Milva came up on Pegasus and kicked one in the face, breaking his nose. When he fell back, crying and begging for divine help, she recognized him.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"You'll have to swim for it. So take us across then come back. An hour of fear, then forget about it.' 'But you will wear a big purse,' hissed Milva 'so you won't forget us until winter.' In view of these arguments, the ferryman relented and soon the whole company was on the ferry. Some of the horses, especially Roach, were stubborn and refused to embark, but the ferryman and his assistant managed to get them aboard. The skill with which they did this, argued that this was not the first time they had smuggled stolen horses across the Yaruga.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"However, the actual slaughter the hail of bolts cause was among the horses. The grey was pierced by three bolts and fell to its knees. It fell kicking its legs and struck Milva, and Regis's bay stallion. Roach shot in the withers reared up and jumped overboard. 'Don't shoot!' Dandelion shouted.",Baptism of Fire,Milva,Roach
"I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well. The problem would solve itself, I am sure that treacherous black-haired beauty would not anticipate the day nor the hour. The Geralt does not like it when someone touches his little girl, Artaud Terranova conclusively found that out on Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion. 'You were seriously wounded, a carter drove you out. At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"An institution standing above personal resentments and animosity. But am I a suitable candidate? Will I find in myself the strength of character to get rid of the animosity I feel to the people who took my Ciri, or tortured a man who is not indifferent to me, and myself...' 'I'm sure,' interrupted the elf, 'that you will find in yourself the strength of character, Yennefer. I know you and know you do not lack such a force. You do not lack ambition, which should dispel doubts about the honour of the promotion.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"I'm going to explode at any moment. And that is before I start to wonder why you recommended me for this lodge instead of another elf of Dol Blathanna or the Blue Mountains.' 'In Montecalvo,' Francesca replied coldly, 'you can find out why.' 'I'd rather not wait.' 'Tell her.' Ida Emean murmured. 'It's about Ciri,' Francesca said after a moment's thought, staring at Yennefer with impenetrable eyes. 'The Lodge is interested in her. And nobody knows the girl as well as you.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Assire, however, remained silent and commanded her with a look that she stay silent. Philippa Eilhart took the floor again. 'Most of us saw Ciri on Thanedd, where she was in a trance and her predictions caused considerable commotion. Some of us have even had close contact with her. I speak mostly of you, Yennefer.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress. And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt. Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl. About her study in the temple of Melitele and Ciri's mysterious abilities. They listen with stone faces, thought Triss, looking at Assire and Fringilla. Like sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Are they surprised because they did not know Emhyr was trying to kidnap her to Nilfgaard? Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence. And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is. Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts. She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face. She was not fooled. A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident. Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Continue, Yennefer.' Philippa said. 'I have nothing more to say.' The black-haired sorceress pursed her lips. 'I repeat, it was Tissaia de Vries who ordered me to bring Ciri to Garstang.' 'It is easier to blame everything on the dead.' Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture. 'I did not want to interfere in what was happening in Aretuza,' said Yennefer, pale and clearly upset. 'I wanted to take Ciri and escape from Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Hence, all these incredible connections. Calanthe, Pavetta... Ciri. Yennefer was involved in it. And now regrets it.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Those who carry the gene, have it available even in their hair. I examined her hairs and I found something I did not understand. Now I get it.' 'So Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' Yennefer said quietly. 'She is not there.' 'She is not there.' Philippa Eilhart confirmed seriously. 'Emhyr was cheated, someone slipped him a doppelganger.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Assire var Anahid, who clearly felt uncomfortable in her tight dress, had just said something about a young nobleman from Nilfgaard. Yennefer knew who she meant and unconsciously clenched her fists. A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes... 'There will therefore be a great opportunity,' Keira Metz cried excitedly 'to regain Ciri and also rip the skin from Vilgefortz, then set fire to the floor under the rogue's ass!' 'Burning the ground will be preceded by discovering Vilgefortz hideout,' Sile de Tansarville scoffed, who had never had much sympathy for Yennefer. 'And so far none have succeeded. Even some of the ladies sitting at this table have spared their invaluable time and talents in the search.' 'We have already found two of Vilgefortz many hiding places.' Philippa Eilhart replied coolly.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.' 'Triss is right,' Margarita Laux-Antille supported, 'I know why she ran away, who she wants to save. I saw them both, her and Ciri, together. I understand everything.' 'And I don't understand anything!' Sabrina screamed out loud again. Assire var Anahid leaned towards her friend.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"What am I to tell?' 'Of Yennefer,' cried Nimue, the youngest of the listeners, who because of her height was called Thumbelina, was stroking a cat that had fallen asleep on her lap. 'Tell us about the Sorceress. How she escaped the convent at Bald Peak in a magical way to save Ciri. I'd love to hear it. When I grow up, I want to become a Sorceress.' 'Certainly!' the miller's son, Bronik yelled.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"When I grow up, I want to become a Sorceress.' 'Certainly!' the miller's son, Bronik yelled. 'Better wipe your nose, Thumbelina because sorceresses don't teach people with snot! And you, old man, don't tell us about Yennefer, but about Ciri and the Rats, how they were going to steal...' 'Quiet,' said Connor, gloomy and thoughtful. 'You are a flock of idiots. If we are to hear anything today, then it must be in order.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer
"Tell us of the Geralt Geralt, from the point where the company was leaving the Yaruga.' 'But first,' interjected Bronik, 'Tell us about all the others, grandfather, let us not be bothered by our curiosity. What happened to them? Briefly about Yennefer and Ciri. We can't wait until you visit our village again. Please.' 'Yennefer,' grandfather Pogwizd chuckled, 'cast a spell and escaped from the castle on Bald Peak and splashed straight into the sea.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Yennefer

"They found a relatively dry place, sat down, and wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets. Milva went to inspect the area. As soon as she left, Dandelion proceeded to vent his curiosity, which the Brokilon archer had aroused in him. That girl certainly likes a bit of action,  he muttered. You're lucky, you have a gift for meeting these kinds of women, Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Her thighs, I tell you, they are like marble. Oh I tell you, you can't have been bored during the month you spent in Brokilon...

Why do you stare at me when my back is turned?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva

"The number of dead was impossible to determine, or even to approximate. To get rid of them hastily, not only were arrows, swords and lances used, but also lumberjack equipment they had found on site - axes, saws and long handsaws.

"Geralt first heard the whinny of a horse following them. With a stony face, he turned Roach.

"Must be that still not wed, that is why so jolly! Um-ta, um-ta, uhu-ha! Dandelion laughed suddenly, pulled out the lute from under his wet coat, and paying no attention to the hisses of Geralt and Milva, he plucked the strings and sang in a loud voice: In the grass can you see, wolf just limps along, Looking down, awful frown, crying like a dog. Why is this mighty beast so badly rampaged? Must be that, freshly wed or lately engaged!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Hello, I am Zoltan Chivay. I'm Geralt,  the Geralt introduced himself after a moment's hesitation. The one who sang is Dandelion. And this is Milva. Rrr-rrwa mother!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"After some thought, Zoltan Chivay ordered that there be room left for the children to sit. The command was carried out with hesitation – Geralt noticed that the refugees kept their distance from the dwarves and were reluctant to give up the children. Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking. Zoltan Chivay whistled on his fingers, signaling it was time to end the salvaging, then he cast a professional eye over Roach, Pegasus, and Milva's black bay.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Zoltan Chivay licked his lips in response, and told her he was a master at preparing horsemeat, which infuriated Milva even more. They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The women from Kernow dried their black and grey clothes on the surrounding branches, shamefully hiding in the bushes in their underwear, scoffing their meals. The scruffy children ran about having fun, disturbing the dignified calm of the steaming forest. Dandelion slept off his fatigue. Milva had disappeared. The dwarves rested, but remained active.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"And now go away. I want to be alone. When after a while he turned round, he saw only Dandelion had gone. I had the dream again,  he stated dryly. Milva, I'm losing time.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I'd be happy to eat it. Zoltan is right,  said Milva. And you be quiet, Dandelion, because its not poetic. If there's milk in the oatmeal, then there is a cow. And any peasant, would have noticed the fumes of the fires, taken his cow and escaped into the woods.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Obviously they are not afraid of smallpox. Yazon Varda shook his head. Fear,  whispered Dandelion,  is a human thing. In them is no longer anything human. Except their guts,  Milva croaked, carefully embedding her arrow on the string.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Strategy, which jumps out of the bushes, I leave to dwarves. And hanging from an oak, too.' Zoltan waved his hand and walked to the tree. Dandelion who could not resist his curiosity, spurred on Pegasus, and went after the dwarf. Geralt, after a moment's reflection, followed them. Milva trailed after him.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'They need to guard their wives and daughters.' Milva growled. 'The monsters are aware that there are horny soldiers in the procession, and they would not let even a sheep pass. And if they put clothing on a willow tree, it would be just them and the knot hole.' Dandelion, who had no longer lost his humour and talkativeness, tightened the strings on his lute and began to compose a couplet to the use of willows, lustful soldiers and knot holes; the dwarf and the parrot competed in helping with the rhymes. *** 'O.' Zoltan said. 'What?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Farewell.' 'Interesting.' Milva muttered to Geralt, when their weakened squad departed on the road, waving farewell to the four dwarves left behind. 'I wonder what was in those boxes, that they needed to bury them and mark the place. And so that none of us saw.' 'It's not our business.' 'I don't think,' Dandelion said softly while carefully guiding Pegasus among the fallen trunks, 'that the boxes contained clean underwear. They had high expectations for that shipment. I've talked to them on many evenings to know what they are hiding.' 'And what might they be hiding, in your opinion?' 'Their future.' The poet looked to see if anyone was listening.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Figgis and Yazon are blacksmiths, and spoke of a forge. Caleb Stratton wants to get married but his bride's parents expelled him once for being penniless. And Zoltan...' 'Stop, Dandelion. Gossiping is for women.' 'I apologize, Milva.' 'There is no need to.' Once they cross the river, the dark damp strip of trees became more spares and turned into low birch trees and dry grassland. Despite this, they rode slowly.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Despite this, they rode slowly. They followed the example of Milva, who immediately after leaving the forest, place a freckled little girl with braids into her saddle. Dandelion also seated a child on Pegasus, and Zoltan, took two on his chestnut stallion, as he walked alongside holding the reins. But the pace did not increase; the women of Kernow were in no condition to go faster. *** It was almost evening, when after hours of wandering among the gorges and ravines, Zoltan Chivay stopped and exchanged a few words with Percival Schuttenbach, after which he turned to the rest of the company.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"That's impossible!' 'It's possible.' Milva said grimly, patiently pulling dry leaves and pine needles from the hair of the girl with freckles, who she was carrying on her horse. 'All the turns have confused use. We have turned in the wrong direction.' 'But it is still the river O.' Dandelion repeated stubbornly. 'If we stay with it we can't get lost. The river will meander, and twist, but eventually it will empty into an estuary.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Milva rode alongside the Geralt, the little girl with the braids asleep in her arms. 'If I understand,' she said, 'something in those woods three years ago, almost ended your life. You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion. 'You were seriously wounded, a carter drove you out. At his family's farm you later found Ciri.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt. He decided that when the next time they camped he would box Dandelion's ears for his uncontrollable tongue. Knowing the poet, it would have no effect; especially considering Dandelion sung everything he knew. 'Maybe we made a mistake by not going through the moss forests,' Milva mussed aloud.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"All in there. And you know what they are whispering now? There is no need to fetch dinner because it has already come.' 'Why don't we turn around?' Dandelion suggested anxiously. 'Let's run away while there is still light?' 'I am also of the same opinion.' 'The women are stumbling,' Milva said angrily. 'The children fall from their arms.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Fen Carn, while I've never been here, if something dangerous had occurred, I would have heard about it.' No one made a comment, not even Field Marshal Duda. The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"You're a Geralt; it would be unacceptable for your body.' 'So the best thing is your mandrake.' The Geralt raised the glass that Milva had filled and given to him, and drank to the bottom, then coughed until tears came to his eyes. 'Damn, I feel better.' 'I'm not sure,' Regis said with a tight-lipped smile, 'you are treating the disease properly. I remember you should cure the causes not the symptoms.' 'Not for this Geralt.' A ruddy faced Dandelion snorted. 'For him and his worries, booze will do him good.' 'You should too.' Geralt froze the poet with a look. 'Especially if it numbs your tongue.' 'Do not count on it.' The surgeon smiled again.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened. Regis also listened and even added comments, completely calm about being the only sober one among those present. Dandelion strummed his lute and sang. It is not unusual beautiful women are hard to see, The more proud the tree, the high you have to climb it. 'Idiot.' Milva commented.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots. All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Everyone knows that if you ride around the cemetery on the back of a black horse, when it stops in front of a grave and refused to move, that is where the vampire is. Then we must dig it up and drive a stake through its heart. We must have the black horse!' 'Could you not use another coloured horse?' Dandelion asked conciliatory, offering the reins of Pegasus to the peasant. 'We can not.' 'Then you are unlucky,' Milva said through clenched teeth, 'because I'm not giving up my horse.' 'Why will you not give it? Have you not been listening to what I said, woman?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Nor could it hurt to rest. And whatever killed the girl and the boy, better look out, because there will be a Geralt in the camp.' 'And while we're at it,' Geralt pursed his lips, 'I'll ask you not to go around telling everyone who I am and my name. This goes for you to, Dandelion.' 'As you wish.' The dwarf nodded. 'You have your reasons. Well, you warned us just in time, because the camp is already in sight.' 'And in earshot,' Milva said, breaking a long silence.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'I do not believe what the old woman said. You are not disgusting underground goblins. You are not a white freak from hell, and you Uncle Dandelion, you're not a gaudy peacock. The old woman lied. And you Aunt Milva, you're no pervert with a bow, Aunt Milva, I like you.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I bet they are sitting somewhere and playing cards!' 'We must get fodder for the horses,' Milva said. 'And drink. Let's go down to the river.' 'Maybe we will be able to find some hot food.' Dandelion said. 'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry. 'Did you find something to eat?' The gnome blew his nose and wiped his fingers on the fleece of a sheep returning from the river.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'We had the notion to marrying him off.' 'I have nothing against it,' Zoltan said angrily. 'I wish him happiness in his new way of life. Health, happiness and prosperity.' 'And lots of small Clogs' Dandelion said. 'No, no, gentlemen,' said the peasant 'Do not laugh, how are supposed to marry him? After you knocked him in the head his mind is completely addled, he can not even distinguish between day and night.' 'Well, that doesn't sound so bad after all,' Milva said, looking at the ground.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I don't want to talk about it anymore – pay the blood money.' 'What?' 'When a knight kills a peasant, he has to pay the blood money. So the law now stands.' 'I am not a knight!' Milva screamed. 'That is the first,' supported Dandelion. 'Secondly, it was an accident. Thirdly, Clog is still alive, so it can not therefore be a question of blood money, but of damages and compensation.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Therefore, she readily serves demons to be able to satisfy her insatiable and unnatural lust!' 'Now we learn something fundamental about women,' murmured Regis. 'This is phobia, in its pure, clinical form. Holy men often dream of vagina dentata.' 'I bet its worse,' Dandelion replied, also in a whisper. 'He probably daydreams all the time about a normal one, without teeth. And the desire has risen to his brain.' 'And that deranged girl will pay for it.' 'Can we not find anyone,' growled Milva, 'who will stop this black fool?' Dandelion looked meaningfully and with hope towards the Geralt but Geralt avoided his gaze.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I am familiar with the ways and means of sorceresses; I know what this decoction was made with! The witch boiled a cat alive!' The crowd murmured with horror. 'How gruesome,' Dandelion shuddered. 'Boiling a living creature? I feel sorry for the girl, but this has gone a little too far...' 'Shut up,' Milva said.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Our horses!' Milva yelled, sending kicks and punches around her. 'Our horses, Geralt! To me, quickly!' 'Geralt!' Dandelion screamed. 'Help!' The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it. Geralt grabbed Dandelion by the collar but was not carried away because he managed to latch onto the wagon, which the girl accused of witchcraft was tied to.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Did you see?' 'No. I have not ruled out that during the fighting they were cut down or trampled by horses. There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Second, because we lie bound in a shed which is located in the center of a camp of an army of several thousand people.' 'And the third reason? You mentioned three.' 'Third,' he replied wearily, 'the limit of miracles for this month has already been exhausted when the women of Kernow found their missing husbands.' *** 'There,' the surgeon said, pointing out the glowing dots of campfires. 'There is the fort of America, the current troop camp for the Temerian army concentrated in Mayena.' 'The Geralt and Dandelion are imprisoned there?' Milva stood in her stirrups. 'Ha, it is so dark... There will be crowds of armed people around and guards.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Straight to the Ina. Milva is waiting there with horses.' 'Help me get up...' He stood up on one leg, then the second, biting his fist. Dandelion's circulation had had time to return to normal. The Geralt, after a moment, was also ready. 'How do we get out?' the poet suddenly asked.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"*** 'Dawn will be here soon,' Milva said not looking at the sky but at the glossy surface of the river. 'The catfish chase the salmon. But there is no sign of the Geralt or Dandelion. Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion. 'Pah...",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The archer gasped when she saw how the surgeon's eyes gleamed in the darkness, with a cat's light. 'Well, go on,' Regis said calmly. 'Push.' 'Geralt,' Dandelion moaned from the floor, fully conscious, 'Are you crazy? He saved us from the gallows... He healed my head...' 'He saved us and that girl in the camp.' Milva gently reminded him.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror. 'Farewell and good luck.' 'Goodbye, Regis. Same to you.' Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy snapped his cloak, wrapped it around himself and disappeared.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession. The recovery of Pegasus and the lute strapped to his saddle had significantly improved his mood. At around noon they came back to a sunny meadow behind which they could see the wide floodplain of the Great Yaruga.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"He watched the cormorants sitting withered in a tree. Cahir, after the talk, disappeared into the bushes and did not come back. Milva and Dandelion were looking for something to eat. Inside the boat they had found under the seats a copper saucepan and a basket of vegetables. They made a trap out of wicker found in the boat and waded around the shore with sticks beating the seaweed, trying to propel the fish into the trap.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The poet was feeling better already and walked with his head bandaged heroically, proud as a peacock. The Geralt was thoughtful and angry. Dandelion and Milva pulled the wicker trap from the water and started to curse, because instead of carp, they had caught little fish among the weeds. The Geralt stood. 'Come here you two!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"It is dangerous and a long way. And I cannot wait. So I'm going alone.' 'Having disposed of cumbersome baggage,' Dandelion nodded.' The ball and chain hindering your march. In other words, me.' 'And me,' Milva added, looking away. 'Listen,' said Geralt, much calmer now.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"But I'll give you advice anyway. The need for atonement, a baptism of fire, guilt, these are things to which you can claim an exclusive right. Life is different from banking; it allows debts to be repaid by the debt of others.' 'Go, please.' 'As you wish.' The vampire left and joined Dandelion and Milva. While changing the bandages, the trio discussed what there was to eat. Milva looked in to wicker basket at the small fish.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Milva looked in to wicker basket at the small fish. 'There is no need to meditate,' she said. 'We can stuff these little fish onto sticks and roast them over a fire.' 'No.' Dandelion said shaking his bandaged head. 'Not a good idea. The fish are too small, there aren't enough of them.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I will bring water and start a fire. And you can clean these loaches yourself.' 'These are not loaches,' Regis said. 'They are chub, roach and bream.' 'Ha,' Dandelion could not resist. 'I see you know about fish.' 'I know many things,' the vampire acknowledged modestly. 'I have studied here and there.' 'If you are such an expert,' Milva again blew on the fire, and then got up.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"The cauldron, full of little fish and vegetables started to boil. The vampire stirred it with a spoon that Milva had carved from wood. Once Cahir had cleaned and divided the pike, Dandelion through the tail and head into the cauldron and stirred thoroughly. 'Yum, yum, it smells good. When everything is cooked lets strain the remains.' 'Unless you use your socks,' Milva raised her eyebrows, while carving another spoon, 'we don't have a strainer.' 'My dear, Milva,' Regis smiled.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'What remains in the armor we can then discard.' 'Make sure you wash it first,' Milva said. 'Otherwise, I won't eat this soup.' The filtration went smoothly. 'Now throw away the slops, Cahir,' Dandelion ordered. 'It smells good, yum, yum. There is no need for more wood, Geralt!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Is not an excuse for thoughtless actions. When one doesn't know or is in doubt, it is good to seek advice...' 'Shut up, Vampire!' Geralt stood up and turned his back. Dandelion snorted. 'Look at him, you've offended him again.' 'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan. If he doesn't know what to do he just talks and sulks.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"After eating half of the soup they carefully stared catching pieces of pike, and finally drained the cauldron to the bottom. 'I say,' gasped Milva. 'That it was a silly thing to have soup, Dandelion.' 'Certainly,' Regis agreed. 'What do you say, Geralt?' 'I say – thank you.' The Geralt stood up with effort, rubbed his knee, which began to bite back with pain. 'Is that enough?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Ignore him. He was just lucky, I was with him when he was quarrelling with Yennefer, a pale beauty with raven hair.' 'Be more discreet,' the vampire reminded him. 'And do not forget, he has problems.' 'Problems,' Cahir stifled a belch, 'must be addressed.' 'True,' Dandelion said. 'But how?' Milva snorted and stretched out to make herself more comfortable on the warm sand. 'The vampire is a scholar.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'May the devil take you, you idiots cooperating in your groups united by a common goal, which none of you understand. And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head. 'Comrades in arms!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Or I'll grab a stick and tan you all, bastards! I said in order. Grandfather Pogwizd will tell us about the Geralt and how he wandered with Dandelion, Milva...' 'Yes!' Nimue squeaked again. 'About Milva. I want to hear about Milva!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Did you check and see if you have teeth marks on your neck?' 'Do not mock,' Milva snorted. 'You know more about vampires than us. You can mock, Dandelion, but you must answer me. I grew up in the mountains, I didn't go to schools, and I'm in the dark. It is not my fault and not right to mock.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you. I'm a vampire, yes.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt. 'He doesn't. You do not need to confide or to explain.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'You have made into an evil myth. Many men and women secretly want something similar, and yet are reluctant to provide their partner with anything but the generally accepted sexual stereotype. So we do it for you in this vampire mythology and thus it grows into a fascinating symbol of evil.' 'Did I not tell you?' Milva cried at the same moment that Regis had finished explaining to Dandelion. 'It's always the same! They begin with wisdom and always end up between a girl's legs!' *** The cries of the cranes gradually disappeared into the distance.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"*** Since dawn they had not seen or heard any troops. Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"It came from a fire, which was baking something. 'Will we avoid it?' Milva asked softly. 'First let's take a look,' he said getting off his horse and handing the reins to Dandelion. 'Better to know what we are avoiding. And who it is behind us.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Milva! Regis!' Zoltan shouted, squeezing all. 'Dandelion, alive, albeit with a bandage on his head! And what do you have to say about this melodramatic cliché? Life, is not poetry!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"There is nothing ridiculous about it poet. And you yourself, out of curiosity, what is your name? Because Dandelion is an obvious pseudonym.' 'I cannot reveal my true name,' said the bard mysteriously, looking proudly down his nose. 'It is too well known and famous.' 'And mine,' Milva suddenly joined in the conversation, after being grim and silent, 'made me sick in the guts when I was named so I shortened it to: Maria, Mariquilla or Marieta. Well when on hears my name, they think they are free to slap my ass...' *** It was growing dark.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Yes, we all knew that Milva vomited at dawn. But sometimes we ate things that had all of our guts churning. Dandelion also vomited once or twice, and once Cahir got diarrhoea, and was terrified that he had caught dysentery. The fact that the girl now and again jumped from her saddle and ran off to the bushes, I took for a bladder infection... How could I have been so stupid?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'We are a team, and so we assume mutual responsibility. Nothing changes the fact that among us there is one who bears the highest responsibility. Directly, so to speak.' 'Express yourself more clearly, damn it!' snapped Dandelion. 'Team, responsibility...What is wrong with Milva? What is this disease?' 'This is not a disease,' Cahir said quietly.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"As primitive tribes, adhering to shamanic taboo? It is obvious that only a woman could make such a decision, it is their inherent right! If Milva decides to...' 'Shut up, Dandelion,' the Geralt growled. 'Be so kind as to shut up.' 'Do you believe otherwise?' the poet raised his voice. 'Would you forbid...' 'Shut up, damn it, because I will not vouch for myself!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Go away, Geralt. Go away, before you shatter my world completely.' *** When they left at dawn, Milva was at the head of the company, calm and smiling. And riding behind her was Dandelion who began to strum his lute, while whistling a tune. Regis and Geralt were bringing up the rear – at one point the vampire looked over at the Geralt, smiled and nodded with approval and admiration. Without a word.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'The Nilfgaardians! Death! Gods, save us!' 'Hold the horses, Dandelion!' Milva ordered, removing her bow from its case. 'Hold the horses!' 'It is not the imperials,' Cahir said. 'I do not think...' His voice was drowned by the cries of the nearest horse and the screaming ferryman.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'Grab those spars, my lords! Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"But from around a bend in the river, appeared another beach, sandy and with shallow shoals and on the shore were the Nilfgaardian troops. Some rode into the river and prepared their bows. Everyone, including Dandelion, rushed to the spars. Soon they were unable to reach the bottom; the current was dragging the ferry. 'Well,' said Milva, panting and releasing the spar.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle. However, the actual slaughter the hail of bolts cause was among the horses. The grey was pierced by three bolts and fell to its knees.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"It fell kicking its legs and struck Milva, and Regis's bay stallion. Roach shot in the withers reared up and jumped overboard. 'Don't shoot!' Dandelion shouted. 'We are your people!' This time he succeeded. The ferry, carried by the current, crashed to a halt against the bank.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"'I want him to stay with me...' A tear run down her cheek. Above them the bridge resonated with the boots of soldiers. 'Geralt!' Dandelion cried. The Geralt, seeing what the vampire was doing to Milva, turned his head in embarrassment. He saw soldiers in white jackets rushing along the bridge.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"We also need to run!' 'We can't' he said gritting his teeth. 'Milva miscarried. She will not be able to walk.' Dandelion swore disgustingly. 'We will need to carry her,' he said. 'It is our only chance...' 'Not our only,' Cahir said.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"They are still fighting! Shame on him who does not go to their aid! Follow me!' 'Dandelion,' the Geralt hissed. 'Go back to the island. You have to help Regis get Milva to the left bank.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Milva
"I never do. I also do not carry anything of worth in my pouch. My name is Emiel Regis. I come from Dillingen. I am a surgeon.' 'Of course,' Zoltan Chivay grimaced slightly.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"I am a surgeon.' 'Of course,' Zoltan Chivay grimaced slightly. 'Herbalist, barber or surgeon. No offence, but you smell like an apothecary.' Emiel Regis smiled a thin-lipped smile and raised his hands apologetically. 'The smell gave you away, sir surgeon,' said Geralt, sliding his sword into its sheath. 'Did you have a specific reason why you were hiding from us?' 'Specific?' The man turned his black eyes on him.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"Well in war, life can become quite a jumble. You've frightened us, and we you. Fear has big eyes.' 'For my part,' the man who had introduced himself as Emiel Regis did not look up at them. 'There is no threat. I hope the reverse is true.' 'What do you take us for, footpads?' Zoltan's beard bristled.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"Come on, we'll introduce you to the rest of our company.' As they approached the camp, the horses snorted and beat the ground with their hooves. 'Stand a little upwind, Mister Regis.' Zoltan threw the medic a meaningful look. 'The smell of sage frightens the mounts, and to me, I'm ashamed to admit it, I associate it with pulling teeth.' *** 'Geralt,' murmured Zoltan as Emiel Regis disappeared behind a hanging curtain, which substituted as a door for his cabin. 'Let's keep our eyes open. I do not like this smelly herbalist.' 'Any particular reason?' 'I'm suspicious of people who spend their summers near cemeteries.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"And on top an alembic equipped with a rectification device and a copper cooler! Beautiful work! Did you build this yourself, master surgeon?' 'Yes,' Emiel Regis modestly acknowledged. 'I am dedicated to making elixirs, so I have to distill. To extract the fifth essences, as well as...' He paused, seeing Zoltan place his thumb below the tube to catch a drop and then licked it.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"'But do not expect they are bothered with hot horseshoes.' 'From the fire to the bastard is all of three steps.' Zoltan hissed through clenched teeth. 'Somehow I'll endure; I worked in a forge... But pray for me to those gods of yours...' 'Wait a minute.' Emiel Regis, put his hand on the dwarf's shoulder. 'Please refrain from praying.' The surgeon approached the fire, respectfully bowed to the priest and to the audience and then without the slightest hesitation, reached his hand into the burning coals. The crowd gasped in unison, Zoltan cursed.",Baptism of Fire,Emiel,Zoltan
"Yes, hem, hem. Dear Philippa. Miss Triss Merigold is definately concerned about the fate of the Geralt, whom she teleported from Thanedd to Brokilon. Making this fact a profound secret even from me, hurt me terribly. But you can reassure her.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"*** The spell of teleprojection was tricky, the sorcerers were to speak with one voice, by joining hands and thoughts. Even then, it turned out to be a devilishly strenuous exercise, partly because the distance was so considerable. The clenched eyelids of Philippa Eilhart quivered, Triss Merigold panted, and sweat beads ran down the high forehead of Keira Metz. Only the face of Margarita Laux-Antille expressed no fatigue. The small room plunged into semi-lit darkness, suddenly, a mosaic of light began to dance along the dark wood paneling.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"I, Philippa Eilhart, the mistress of this castle, as hostess and instigator of this meeting will handle the introductions. To my right, Margarita Laux-Antille, the head of the Academy of Aretuza. To my left, Triss Merigold, of Maribor, and Keira Metz, of Carreras. Next, we have Sabrina Glevissig, of Ard Carraigh and Sheala Tancarville of Creyden, representing Kovir. Then Francesca Findabair, known as Enid an Gleanna, the current ruler of the Valley of Flowers.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"And I, Sheala de Tancarville, will personally take appropriate action against the indiscreet. None of the sorceresses moved nor uttered a word. Triss did not for a moment doubt Sheala's warning. The Kovir recluse did not make threats she threw to the wind. We give you the stage, Philippa.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"And yet we know how our fellow sorcerers are treated in Nilfgaard. We talk of being apolitical, but when Nilfgaard wins and we find ourselves under Imperial power, we will all look like ... Triss moved uneasily, Philippa let out a barely audible sigh. Keira looked down, Sheala pretended to adjust her boa. Francesca bit her lip.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"It's a sad fate that awaits us all. Sabrina finished quickly. Philippa, Triss and I, all three of us were at Sodden Hill. Emhyr will make us pay, as we will pay forThanedd, and for the entirety of our involvement. But this is just one of the reservations that stops me from agreeing to the declared political neutrality of the convention.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Even if it is a game, let's put our trust in it.' 'And if this is provocation?' 'You know better than I the people involved in this.' Enid an Gleanna reflected. 'Sile de Tansarville,' she said at last, 'is a secretive recluse, she has no political connections. Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?'

"The magicians from the north were beautiful, charming and sparkled with jewellery, but in their eyes, gently emphasized by makeup, there was no hint of either drugs or nymphomania. None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable. Sile de Tansarville, a researcher, immediately found a lot of common topics with the researcher Assire var Anahid and Fringilla quickly gained a liking to the cheerful Triss Merigold. The conversations were accompanied by the greed absorption of oysters. Only Sabrina Glevissig refused, being a faithful daughter of Kaedwen's forests, she even expressed her contempt for the  slimy filth  and her desire for a piece of cold venison with prunes.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes. 'And Scoia'tael hidden in the basement.' Keira Metz muttered. Triss froze her with a glare. Philippa made the introductions. Fringilla stared curiously at Francesca Findabair, Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, the famous Queen of Dol Blathanna, ruler of the elves who had recently regained their country.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Trust, respect, credibility, the general belief in our usefulness, it that magic is essential. Standing before us seems to be a simple alternative – either the loss of status and isolation in ivory towers, or service. Service even on the hills of Sodden, even as war leaders...' 'Or as servants and messengers?' Triss Merigold said throwing back her beautiful hair. 'With bowed neck, ready to serve whenever the Emperor moves a finger? Because at the end of the day that is the role that Nilfgaard will give us, if they were to conquer us.' 'If you were to be conquered,' Philippa said with emphasis,' We would have no alternative.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"A young girl, suitable for a young prince. A girl who can give birth, because this is about a dynasty. That sets the bar and excludes you, Philippa and excludes me, it even excludes Keira and Triss, the youngest among us. It also excludes all adepts from my school, which, after all, are not very interesting because the buds of the petals are still of an unknown colour, it is unthinkable that any one of them could sit with us as at the empty place at this table as the twelfth. In other words, even if the whole of Kovir goes mad and was willing to accept the king's marriage to a sorceress, a sorceress can not be found.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"A black knight with wings on his helmet, the nightmare of Ciri's ravings... She felt the eyes of Francesca and Philippa on her. Triss, however, whose gaze she was trying to attract, avoided her eyes. Damn, thought Yennefer, with effort keeping an indifferent expression on her face. What damn snare entangles this girl?",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"It became immediately clear that her hopes were going to be dashed. Margarita m clearly wished to speak with her, Philippa quickly pulled her to the other end of the hall. Triss Merigold, who approached her was accompanied by Francesca. The elf monitored the conversation without embarrassment. But Yennefer saw the anxiety in Triss's eyes and she was sure had the conversation had no witnesses it would have been full of useless pleas for help.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Philippa
"Especially since we benefit from such a rear guard. Milva said, looking meaningfully at Geralt. Are you certain that this Cahir is your enemy? The Geralt did not answer. He handed Zoltan his sword.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"But we will not be able to save them if we are killed or captured. Grab the horses and follow me into the forest. Hurry!' *** He is called Cahir, Milva recalled, casting a look at her strange companion who was sitting on a fallen tree. The strange Nilfgaardian who says he isn't a Nilfgaardian. Cahir.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"She didn't say a word. Although I saved her life.' 'It'd take the devil to understand this,' she said. 'Your destiny, Cahir, is intricate and complex. Not for my head.' 'And what is your name?' he asked suddenly. 'Milva...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Not a soul there either. The camp held two hundred refugees. Did no one save their neck?' 'If the imperials won, they would have taken everyone into slavery,' Cahir replied, also in a whisper. 'If your side won, they would have taken the refugees away from this place.' They moved closer to the shore, to the overgrown marsh reeds. Milva stepped on something and jumped back, stifling a cry at the sight of a hand emerging from the mud covered in leeches.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Regis is that you?' 'It is I,' the surgeon quietly appeared out of the darkness. 'I was worried about you. You are not alone, I can see.' 'You see well,' Milva let go of Cahir's arm, who had already reached for his sword. 'I am not alone but the same cannot be said about yourself. Regis, where is the Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Wait at the river where the Chotla empties into the Ina. When I manage to free the Geralt, we'll head in that direction. There we will meet.' 'He is highly arrogant,' Cahir whispered to Milva after dismounting from their horses found them close to each other. 'Alone, without any help he is going into trouble, did you hear? Who is he?' 'I truly, do not know,' whispered Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Yesterday with his bare hands, he pulled a horseshoe out of red hot coals, before my eyes...' 'A wizard?' 'No,' Regis said from behind Pegasus, giving evidence of exceptionally sensitive hearing. 'Is it that important? I do not ask for your personal details.' 'I am Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.' 'Thank you and I am full of admiration,' the surgeon's voice held a hint of mockery. 'as that Nilfgaardian name was pronounced with almost no accent.' 'I'm not...' 'Enough!' Milva cut him off. 'There is no time to argue and dawdle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Have a drink. I will sit close to you and warm you.' More catfish hit the shallows, the group coming close to the surface in a shower of silver.

Banish these thoughts.' 'Are you not afraid?' 'I'm scared.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"The contents of the report were known to Dijkstra the same evening. Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon. *** When the horse carrying the Geralt and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous. They had recently been hearing the sounds of battle carried along the waters of the Ina. While helping lower the port from the saddle, Milva saw Geralt tense at the sight of the Nilfgaardian.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"But you are no ordinary vampire.' 'How much?' 'I doubt,' The Geralt's voice was cold as ice. 'I doubt anyone could afford it.' 'I understand and thank you,' the vampire smiled, this time revealing his teeth. At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror. 'Farewell and good luck.' 'Goodbye, Regis. Same to you.' Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy snapped his cloak, wrapped it around himself and disappeared.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"The day broke with a red sun, which shone blindingly off of the water lily covered lakes; they turned towards the spot where one of the many branches of the Ina flowed into the Yaruga. The now rode through the dark gloomy forests, where the trees grew directly from the duckweed from the green marshes. Milva rode at the head, next to the Geralt, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir. Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour. Dandelion moaned and cursed, complaining of a headache, but held up bravely and did not inhibit the procession.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"I should have killed him. I am only interested in one thing: to get at the skins of those who have hurt Ciri. I vowed to myself that those who have hurt her will pay for it with their blood.' Cahir remained silent. 'Your revelation, which Milva told me about, does not change anything. They only show one thing: At Thanedd you had not managed to kidnap Ciri, although you tried hard.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Ciri dances in a shed on a table and is happy...' 'Milva told you my dreams.' 'No. She did not tell me anything. You do not believe me?' 'No.' Cahir bowed his head and a scuffed his heel in the sand. 'I forgot,' he said, 'that you cannot believe m, you don't have to trust me. I understand that.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'I'll buy you another.' *** The Geralt was sitting on the sand among the reeds, sullen, angry and pensive. He watched the cormorants sitting withered in a tree. Cahir, after the talk, disappeared into the bushes and did not come back. Milva and Dandelion were looking for something to eat. Inside the boat they had found under the seats a copper saucepan and a basket of vegetables.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"The cauldron, full of little fish and vegetables started to boil. The vampire stirred it with a spoon that Milva had carved from wood. Once Cahir had cleaned and divided the pike, Dandelion through the tail and head into the cauldron and stirred thoroughly. 'Yum, yum, it smells good. When everything is cooked lets strain the remains.' 'Unless you use your socks,' Milva raised her eyebrows, while carving another spoon, 'we don't have a strainer.' 'My dear, Milva,' Regis smiled.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Of course we can! What we do not have, we can easily replace with what we have. It is simply a matter of initiative and positive thinking.' 'To the devil with your learned chatter, vampire.' 'We can strain it threw my chainmail,' Cahir said. 'What remains in the armor we can then discard.' 'Make sure you wash it first,' Milva said. 'Otherwise, I won't eat this soup.' The filtration went smoothly.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Look at him, you've offended him again.' 'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan. If he doesn't know what to do he just talks and sulks. Have you noticed that yet?' 'Long ago.' Cahir said quietly. 'Add pepper.' Dandelion said licking the spoon and chewing. 'And salt.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Ignore him. He was just lucky, I was with him when he was quarrelling with Yennefer, a pale beauty with raven hair.' 'Be more discreet,' the vampire reminded him. 'And do not forget, he has problems.' 'Problems,' Cahir stifled a belch, 'must be addressed.' 'True,' Dandelion said. 'But how?' Milva snorted and stretched out to make herself more comfortable on the warm sand. 'The vampire is a scholar.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"So I thought.' 'Until recently,' the vampire continued, 'we thought Ciri was in Nilfgaard. Getting there and rescuing her or stealing her seemed an impossible task. Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is. It is difficult to speak of initiative when you have no idea what direction to go.' 'What shall we do then?' Milva pouted. 'The Geralt insists we move south...' 'For him,' Regis smiled, 'the cardinal points have no meaning.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Let the plague take you all,' the Geralt said finally waving a spoon indignantly. 'May the devil take you, you idiots cooperating in your groups united by a common goal, which none of you understand. And let the devil take me also.' This time they all followed the example of Cahir, and kept tactfully silent. Dandelion, Maria Barring, called Milva and Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. 'I've found a company!' Geralt continued shaking his head.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Along the way the poet had composed a heroic song, in which military rhymes and melodies resonated and was reminiscent of their recent adventures. The shape of the work clearly suggested that during these adventures, the author of the song and performer had shown himself to be the bravest of the brave. The procession was capped off by Milva and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. Cahir was riding his recovered horse and led by the bridle a gray horse loaded with their modest equipment. At last they left the riverside wetlands and found themselves on dry lands covered with hills from which they could see to the south the Great Yaruga as a shiny ribbon and to the north in the distance, the Mahakam Mountains.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'No. In the case of blood, no. But if you fancy it, do not hesitate.' Geralt, Milva and Cahir observed the exchange in silence, as heavy as a tomb. 'I know what you are doing, Dandelion,' Regis said slowly. 'And let me reassure you.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Despite the late hour, no one seemed inclined to go to sleep. Milva heated water in a pot hung over the fire and used the steam to straighten the fletching on her arrows that were wrinkled. Cahir was repairing a broken boot buckle. Geralt was carving a stick. And Regis ran his eyes over each of them in order.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"It seems that I should have explained some things to you a long time ago...' 'Nobody is forcing you,' Geralt threw a long and carefully carved piece of wood into the fire and raised his head. 'I do not need your explanations. I'm the old-fashioned type, when someone extends their hand to me; I accept them as a companion and that means more to me that a contract signed in the presence of a notary.' 'I too am old-fashioned.' Cahir said, still bent over his boot. 'I do not know there was a new fashion,' Milva said dryly, placing another arrow in the steam the rose from the pot. 'Do not worry about Dandelion's chatter,' added the Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"objects. They laughed at my expense.' Milva, who was still occupied in fixing the deformed arrows, muttered angrily. Cahir finished fixing his boots and gave the impression that he was sleeping. 'Later,' Regis went on, 'I started developing alarming symptoms. The fun and companionship started to play a secondary role.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'I have spoken of fears rooted in the consciousness and the subconscious,' he said quietly. 'Do not be bothered by the metaphor, but the crow is not afraid of the coat and hat hanging on a stick, when it settles on it in apprehension. But when the wind stirs the fear, the crow will react by fleeing.' 'The behaviour of the crow explains the struggle for life.' Cahir pointed out from the darkness. 'The crow is smart,' Milva snorted. 'It is not afraid of a straw man, but real men, because men throw stones and shoot arrows.' 'Self-preservation,' said Geralt, 'is inherent in all living things, crows and people.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Someone is trying to block the trails, I think.' 'It is not impossible,' Regis admitted, 'that the Temerian army is hunting for Squirrels here. But I think there are too many soldiers around here. I suspect that the Nilfgaardians have finally crossed the Yaruga.' 'That's what I suspect,' the Geralt grimaced slightly, looking at Cahir's stony face. 'The corpses we saw this morning, showed signs of the Nilfgaardian method of warfare.' 'Some others are no better.' Milva growled, coming to the young Nilfgaardians defence. 'And do not look askance at Cahir, for both of you share the same fate.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"*** Since dawn they had not seen or heard any troops. Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'We, the Nilfgaardians! Only yesterday, when I called you a Nilfgaardian you jumped like you had been stung by a wasp. See if you can decide, Cahir, who you are.' 'To you,' Cahir shrugged, 'I am a Nilfgaardian, and I can see I'm not going to convince you otherwise. However, to be accurate, know that such a name in the Empire is only entitled to the indigenous inhabitants of the capital and the surrounding area, located along the lower basin of the Alba. My family comes from Vicovaro and therefore...' 'Shut your mouth!' Milva ordered sharply with little courtesy, who was at the forefront.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Yes, we all knew that Milva vomited at dawn. But sometimes we ate things that had all of our guts churning. Dandelion also vomited once or twice, and once Cahir got diarrhoea, and was terrified that he had caught dysentery. The fact that the girl now and again jumped from her saddle and ran off to the bushes, I took for a bladder infection... How could I have been so stupid?",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Directly, so to speak.' 'Express yourself more clearly, damn it!' snapped Dandelion. 'Team, responsibility...What is wrong with Milva? What is this disease?' 'This is not a disease,' Cahir said quietly. 'At least not in the strict sense of the word,' confirmed Regis. 'The girl is pregnant.' Cahir nodded as a sign that he had guessed.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'One vote in favour. And you, Geralt?' 'What about me?' 'My lords,' the vampire fixed them with his dark eyes. 'Do not pretend you do not understand.' 'In Nilfgaard,' Cahir said, blushing and lowering his head, 'such matters are determined solely by the woman. Nobody has the right to influence her decision. Regis said that Milva is determined to take the...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Death! Gods, save us!' 'Hold the horses, Dandelion!' Milva ordered, removing her bow from its case. 'Hold the horses!' 'It is not the imperials,' Cahir said. 'I do not think...' His voice was drowned by the cries of the nearest horse and the screaming ferryman. Spurred on by the shouts, the assistant grabbed an axe, swung and cut at the rope.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Push us away from the banks!' The obeyed immediately, grabbing the spare spars on board. Dandelion and Regis stayed with the horses. Milva, Cahir and the Geralt supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant. With the five spars they were slowly able to turn the ferry about and send it gliding towards the center of the river. The soldiers on the bank again raised a roar, and laid their hands on their bows, arrows began to whistle through the air and one of the horses whinnied wildly.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"At first it did not react to all of their efforts, but finally they planted the spars firmly into the ground. It seemed like they would succeed, when suddenly Milva let go of her spar and without a word pointed at the right bank. 'This time...' Cahir said, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'This time, it is Nilfgaard.' Geralt also saw it. The riders, who had appeared on the right bank, wore black and green cloaks, the horses wore distinctive harnesses.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"When after a few moments of straining with the spar, Geralt looked up and saw pine boughs over his head. An arrow shot from the top of the cliffs, struck on the deck of the barge only two feet away from him. Another was heading straight for Cahir, which the Geralt deflected with a slash of his sword. Milva, Cahir, the ferryman and his assistant, no longer pushed from the bottom, but from the shore and the slope. Geralt threw down his sword and sized a spar to help them, and the ferry began to drift back towards the center of the river.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"His black cloak began to puff out like a balloon. 'There, it is done,' Milva put down her bow. 'But it is already too late for him to learn.' 'The other troops behind us,' Cahir pointed to the right bank. 'I assure you that they will not cease in their pursuit. Not after Milva shot their officer.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"Among the people the only one hit was the ferryman, still trying to steer with his spar. The bolt went through him from side to side. Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time. Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts. Dandelion, still shaking his hands and yelling, was not hit by some inexplicable miracle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"She will not be able to walk.' Dandelion swore disgustingly. 'We will need to carry her,' he said. 'It is our only chance...' 'Not our only,' Cahir said. 'Geralt, to the bridge.' 'Why?' 'Let's halt the flight. If the Nordlings can hold the right side of the bridge, we can get Milva to the left bank.' 'How do we stop them fleeing?' 'I have led soldiers before.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"'Go back to the island. You have to help Regis get Milva to the left bank. Why are you still standing here?' 'Follow me, lads!' Cahir yelled, brandishing his sword. 'Follow me, those who believe in the gods! For Binduga!",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
"And so it was that those who had recently been deserting in panic, rushed over the Nilfgaardians like ravenous wolves, cutting with swords, axes, stabbing with spears and bludgeoning with clubs and halberds. The railings on both sides of the bridge cracked, the horses flew into the river along with their riders on their black cloaks. The uproarious army pushed onto the opposite shore, howling and pushing Geralt and Cahir, the accidental commanders, not letting them do what they wanted to do. Which was to withdraw stealthily, back to Milva and move her to the left bank. The battle raged on.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Milva
And yet ... Speak. The an'giyare inquires about a Geralt named Geralt of Rivia and a little girl named Ciri. They were ordered to take those two alive. Under order of execution: it is forbidden to touch a hair on their heads or a button on their clothes.,Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"But you can reassure her. The Geralt is fine now. He's even started sending a Brokilon emissary with the task of finding traces of the princess Ciri, the young one who has so interetested you all. Our friend Geralt apparently does not know that Ciri is in Nilfgaard where she is being prepared for her marriage to Emperor Emhyr. The Geralt must be anxious as he sits quietly in Brokilon, so I will try to send him this news.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"I wonder why the Geralt is not seeking contact with Yennefer. I find it hard to believe that his affection bordering on obsession just suddenly evaporated, regardless of his political ideals. On the other hand, if Yennefer was the one who led Ciri to Emhyr and if I were to find evidence of this, it would make me very glad to inform the Geralt as well. The problem would solve itself, I am sure that treacherous black-haired beauty would not anticipate the day nor the hour. The Geralt does not like it when someone touches his little girl, Artaud Terranova conclusively found that out on Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"This hand obviosuly hasn't served him very well in defense,  Milva muttered. Still, something here does not make sense. If this one kidnapped Ciri on behalf of Nilfgaard, why has he fallen into that coffin? Why did the hawker want to sell him to Nilfgaardians? Remove the gag from his mouth, Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Wait, do not fret. But look at the truth. You protect Ciri and you consider yourself her guardian, but this is no ordinary girl. She is a royal child, Geralt. She is predestined for the throne, and there is no doubt about it.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"They did not know how to defend themselves. The girl with braids rose onto all fours, then stood on her feet, and with shaking hands tried unsuccessfully to improve the remnants of her torn garments. The Geralt was surprised, seeing that in general, she was in absolutely no way similar to Ciri, when only a moment before he swore she looked like her twin sister. With an uncoordinated movement the girl rubbed her face, and moved unsteadily towards the cottage, not avoiding the puddle of manure. Hey, wait,  called Milva.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"You've a dangerous craft, Geralt.' 'I can not deny it.' 'I know what happened back then,' boasted Dandelion. 'You were seriously wounded, a carter drove you out. At his family's farm you later found Ciri. Yennefer told me.' At the sound of that name, Milva smiled slightly. This did not escape the attention of Geralt.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt? Have you dreamed of Ciri again? Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream! Ciri is a Child Surprise, Geralt is tied to her by ties of destiny, and therefore he sees her in his dreams.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Just a little drink... And I'll tell you everything... About Ciri and the Geralt... In detail...' 'For fuck's sake bastards!' 'Keep you voice down, dwarf! You are going to wake the children sleeping outside the hut!' 'Don't be angry, archer.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"'Perhaps he is a poet, but he was captured in the company of this miscreant Geralt, I would not vouch for him. It seems to me that you still don't realize what bird you have caught in your snares.' 'The Geralt?' 'Of course, Geralt, who is called the White Wolf. The same rogue who laid claim to the right of Ciri, Pavetta's daughter, granddaughter of Calanthe, the same Ciri of who there is so much talk of now. You are too young to remember those times, when the scandal was all that was talked about at the courts. But I was an eye witness to those events.' 'And what binds him to the princess Ciri?' 'That dog,' the Marshal pointed at Geralt, 'contributed to the marriage of Pavetta, daughter of Queen Calanthe, to Duny, an unknown stranger from the south.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"But keep talking, Marshal.' 'The Geralt,' Vissegerd again pointed his finger at Geralt, 'after the death of Pavetta, wanted to take the girl, but Calanthe wouldn't allow it and threw him out. But he waited for the right time. When the war started with Nilfgaard and Cintra fell, he took advantage of the confusion and turmoil and kidnapped Ciri. He kept the girl hidden, because he knew that we were seeking her. And he eventually grew bored of her and sold her to Emhyr.' 'These are all lies and slander.' Dandelion bellowed.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"'In all that there is not one word of truth!' 'Shut up or I'll gag you. Combine the facts, Count. The Geralt had Ciri, now Emhyr Emreis has her. And the Geralt is arrested mixed in with the vanguard of the Nilfgaardian patrol. What does it mean?' Daniel Etcheverry shrugged.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"The sooner the better.' 'That's what I've been waiting to do,' the poet exploded, 'but the lord Marshal threatened to gag me! We are innocent; it's all blatant fabrication and hideous slander. Ciri was kidnapped from Thanedd Island and Geralt was seriously wounded in her defence. Anyone can confirm this. Any wizard who was on Thanedd.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Any wizard who was on Thanedd. And the Redanian Chancellor, Count Sigismund Dijkstra...' Dandelion stopped suddenly, remembering that Dijkstra was completely unsuitable as a defence witness in this case, and invoking the wizards of Thanedd to improve their position was not a good idea either. 'It is also an absurdity,' he continued talking loudly and quickly, 'accusing Geralt of kidnapping Ciri from Cintra. Geralt found the girl after the massacre of the city, wandering and hid her from others, Nilfgaard agents that were looking for her. I myself was captured by these agents and subjected to torture, to confess where he had hidden Ciri!",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"As everyone knows he intends to marry her and make her the Empress of Nilfgaard. For the time being he is hailing her as the Queen of Cintra and the surrounding area, which causes us many problems.' 'Emhyr,' declared the poet, 'could have sat on the throne of Cintra whenever he wanted. Ciri, whether she takes it however, has the right to the throne.' 'The right?' Vissegerd roared, splashing Geralt with saliva. 'Shit, she has no right! Let Emhyr marry her if he wishes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"A few hundred desert and the king Foltest removes the baton. Already, it is difficult to call this army Cintran. Vissegerd thrashes about, wanting to stop the desertions, thus he is spreading the rumours of the uncertain origin of Princess Ciri and her ancestors.' 'What of yourself, Count,' Geralt could not help it. 'You listen with clear distaste.' 'You have noticed?' Daniel Etcheverry smile slightly. 'Vissegerd knows about my lineage...",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"And Ciri in the hands of Emhyr, is a threat to the unit and the army, and to my king and country. I have no intention of denying rumours surrounding Vissegerd's slander and undermining the authority of his commanded. I'm going to support him in proving that Ciri is a bastard and has no rights to the throne. I will not resist the Marshal, or his decisions and orders. On the contrary, I will support him.' The Geralt twisted his lips into a smile.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"But it was your destiny, Geralt. Since that night, your fate was sealed, inscribed in black runes among the stars. Ciri, Pavetta's daughter is your destiny. And your death. For Ciri, Pavetta's daughter, you'll hang!' The  7th Daerlan  brigade was available to the operation as a separate branch of the Fourth Army Cavalry.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Of all of the commandos there were no more than twelve left and they were mostly wounded.' 'The wind favoured us. We disembarked west of Hirundum and hid in the woods. Cahir tore at his bandages, shouting something about a crazy lady with green eyes, about Ciri the lion of Cintra, about a Geralt who had destroyed his group and about a sorcerer who flew like a bird towards the Tower of Gulls. He asked for a horse and ordered us back to the island, claiming it was the Emperor's orders, which, in this situation, I had to consider the ravings of a madman. In Aedirn, as we already knew, the war was already raging and I thought it best to put together a new squad and resume the fighting against the Dh'oine.' 'Cahir was still with us when I found the contact box which contained your secret orders.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Though you are not the sorcerer who broke the Geralt's bones at Thanedd, I don't think it is safe for you to get close to his sword. What is between you I don't understand, but you saved me and I look at you kindly... So I tell you, Cahir, the Geralt is looking for those who kidnapped Ciri and took her to Nilfgaard, he grits his teeth so much that sparks fly. And when he spits, the saliva hisses.' 'Ciri,' he repeated. 'Beautiful name.' 'You didn't know it?' 'No.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Maria Barring. But they call me, Milva.' 'The Geralt is moving in the wrong direction, Milva,' he said after a moment. 'Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. It was not Nilfgaard who kidnapped her. If she was kidnapped.' 'How is that?' 'It's a long story.' *** 'By the Great Sun,' Fringilla standing in the threshold, tilted her head in surprise and looked at her friend.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Who is this man, Milva?' 'This man,' the archer said, getting angry, 'helped me out of trouble. This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning. Geralt know that that there were three of them, so he listened, but the third soldier issued no sound.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"So I thought.' 'Until recently,' the vampire continued, 'we thought Ciri was in Nilfgaard. Getting there and rescuing her or stealing her seemed an impossible task. Now, after Cahir's revelations, we don't even know where Ciri is. It is difficult to speak of initiative when you have no idea what direction to go.' 'What shall we do then?' Milva pouted. 'The Geralt insists we move south...' 'For him,' Regis smiled, 'the cardinal points have no meaning.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"The rest will follow. In other words, movement is everything, the goal is nothing.' 'That's silly,' said Milva. 'His goal is Ciri. Is she not important to him?' 'I joke,' admitted the vampire, watching Geralt with his back still turned. 'Without much tact.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"'And soon. But back to the matters for which you are clumsily pretending indifference. Your Geralt who was so enthusiastic about the defence of Ciri, acted very foolishly. He threw himself at Vilgefortz. And Vilgefortz destroyed him.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself. You will be asked to explain your relationship with Ciri. From the beginning, from the events that your Geralt was involved in fifteen years ago, when the story took place in Cintra, until the events of the last month and a half. The Lodge will require your absolute honesty and truthfulness, to confirm your loyalty.' 'Who said anything about confirming?",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress. And Fringilla Vigo, the youngest, friendly, with a natural grace and simple elegance, with green eyes and hair as black as Yennefer's, but less abundant, shorter and combed smooth. Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog. She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the Geralt. Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen. About the Nilfgaardian agent, Rience and how he was chasing the girl. About her study in the temple of Melitele and Ciri's mysterious abilities. They listen with stone faces, thought Triss, looking at Assire and Fringilla. Like sphinxes.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Are they surprised because they did not know Emhyr was trying to kidnap her to Nilfgaard? Or is it that they have known everything for a long time, maybe even more than we do? Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss. Of the bloody struggle in Garstang, which resulted in Geralt being mutilated and Ciri being kidnapped. Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play. Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence. And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is. Ciri, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister. *** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about Geralt, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face. She was not fooled. A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident. Equally obvious, however, was the relationship between the sorceress and the Geralt. Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"What damn snare entangles this girl? Damn, how can I look in the Geralt's eyes... 'There will therefore be a great opportunity,' Keira Metz cried excitedly 'to regain Ciri and also rip the skin from Vilgefortz, then set fire to the floor under the rogue's ass!' 'Burning the ground will be preceded by discovering Vilgefortz hideout,' Sile de Tansarville scoffed, who had never had much sympathy for Yennefer. 'And so far none have succeeded. Even some of the ladies sitting at this table have spared their invaluable time and talents in the search.' 'We have already found two of Vilgefortz many hiding places.' Philippa Eilhart replied coolly.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"But where it ends happily, grandfather. Not where it ends in death.' 'Shut up, fool, who is interested in love stories? It's war we want, fighting!' 'About the Geralt's sword!' 'About Ciri and the Rats!' 'Hold up!' Connor threatened them with his fist. 'Or I'll grab a stick and tan you all, bastards! I said in order.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Tell us of the Geralt Geralt, from the point where the company was leaving the Yaruga.' 'But first,' interjected Bronik, 'Tell us about all the others, grandfather, let us not be bothered by our curiosity. What happened to them? Briefly about Yennefer and Ciri. We can't wait until you visit our village again. Please.' 'Yennefer,' grandfather Pogwizd chuckled, 'cast a spell and escaped from the castle on Bald Peak and splashed straight into the sea.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Because you see, her anger was great at the wizard Vilgefortz. She was convinced that he had kidnapped Ciri and she was determined to track him down, have her revenge and rescue Ciri. And that's all I will tell you for now.' 'What about Ciri?' 'Ciri was with the Rats, hiding under the name of Falka. She took to the bandit's life because, although nobody knew it then, in that girl was wickedness and cruelty, all that is wrong, which is hidden in each person, had emerged from her and gradually took advantage over the good. Oh, it was a big mistake made by the Geralts of Kaer Morhen, who taught her to kill!",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"She, however, could not imagine that by killing, the Grim Reaper himself was on her heels. Because the terrible Bonhart was on her trail. It was written that they would meet, Ciri and Bonhart. But that is a story for another time. Now you shall hear the story about the Geralt.' The children were silent and sat in circle around the old man.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Milva led the way, far ahead of the rest of the company. Regis, Dandelion and Cahir talked. 'I hope your druids will help in the matter of Ciri.' worried the poet. 'I meet druids occasionally, and believe me, they are usually recluses. They might not want to talk to us, let alone use magic.' 'Regis,' reminded the Geralt, 'knows someone among those of Caed Dhu.' 'And this knowledge doesn't go back three or four hundred years?' 'It is far more recent,' the vampire said with an enigmatic smile.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Thank you for your help, Surgeon. I see that you have also joined the company of the Geralt.' 'It just came out.' 'Hmmm,' Zoltan stroked his beard. 'So then, what are your plans to find Ciri?' 'We are headed to the east, to Caed Dhu, to the Druid Circle. We hope the druids will help...' 'There is no help,' the girl sitting next to the piles of logs with a bandaged arm spoke in a loud and metallic voice. 'There is no help.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"But it would be nice to at times, over a beer, to mention that a Mahakam forged Sihil is wielded in good hands and for a good cause. There is no disgrace. And when you find the ones who wronged your Ciri, give them one for Caleb Stratton. And remember Zoltan Chivay and the dwarven forges.' 'You can be assured,' Geralt took the sword and buckled it across his back. 'You can be assured that I well remember.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"After the remedy, I will not be able to climb into the saddle. But I will heal, and I will follow you. Because I want you to find Ciri, Geralt. With my help you can find and recover her.' 'That is why you came with me,' he said raising his head. 'For this reason.' She bowered her head.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"For the armies roam the hills and we must get to the Druids in Caed Dhu. It seems to me that this is urgent. That we want to get the information as quick as possible and be off to rescue Ciri.' 'Yes,' Geralt looked away. 'It is important. I want to save and recover Ciri.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Everyone felt the excitement. Even the ferryman and the assistant, who suddenly began to whistle a tune. Geralt also felt a strange exhilaration, as if at any moment from the alders on the left bank Ciri would emerge and he would shout with joy at the sight. Instead the ferryman shouted. And it was not in joy.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"Throwing spears of burning branches with their bare hands at the Nilfgaardian horses. A baptism of fire, thought the Geralt, frantically slashing all around him. I had to pass through a baptism of fire to save Ciri. And now I go through a fire in battle, that generally I do not care about. Which in general I don't understand.",Baptism of Fire,Ciri,Geralt
"I do apologise, my memory fails me. I have it here. Ah yes, a certain Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. Undeniably the allegations against him are serious. He is wanted for murder, desertion, kidnap, rape, theft and forgery of documents.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"personal relations. What did you say was the name of this criminal? Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. Dijkstra was silent for a long time, pretending to rack his memory. No.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Damn! I wrote:  Dear Philippa. Good, continue.''You might be interested to know, that the oddity in the winged helmet, who disappeared as mysteriously as he appeared on Thanedd, is called Cahir Mawr Dyffryn and is the son of steward Ceallach. Surprisingly, we are not the only ones looking for this strange individual, but as it turns out, Vattiera de Rideaux and people of that son of a bitch ...''    Lady Philippa, hem, hem, does not like such words. I wrote:  the scoundrel .",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Such as the kind in the village, which you must have passed, following our trail. Dismount, I said. I am Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. I did not ask you to introduce yourself. I ordered you to dismount.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Or if you prefer, tell this elf to shoot me with her bow. I'm not going to fight you. I'm Cahir Mawr Dyffryn ... son of Ceallach. I want ...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"I will put an arrow in his horse's belly and we can be on our way. He'll not be able to follow. Cahir, son of Ceallach, took one jump and caught his chestnut stallion, leapt into the saddle and galloped off, shouting at the horse to run faster. The Geralt watched him for a moment, climbed onto Roach, and rode on. In silence.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"I will tell you everything!' 'Of course you're going to tell me everything,' drawled the elf. 'Especially since the beginning is behind us and the beginning is always the hardest. Continue.' 'I had orders to force you to confess where you are hiding Rience, Vilgefortz and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach!' 'Amusing. You set a trap to ask me about Rience and Vilgefortz? What can I know about them?",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"The traitor Vilgefortz Roggeveen, sorcerer. And his assistant, called Rience. And above all, Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. Vattier... Lord Vattier is not sure that you have not been dipping your fingers into this betrayal, even unknowingly...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"In the deepest secrecy a plan of action was developed, aimed at eliminating a number of wizards at the Congress on the island of Thanedd. The plan was presented to me as an action that had the full support of the Emperor Emhyr, Vattier de Rideaux and Stefan Skellen, otherwise I would not have agrees to cooperate with the Dh'oine, sorcerers or not, because I have seen too many provocations in my life. The involvement of the empire in this affair was confirmed at Cape Bremervoord by the arrival of the vessel that brought Cahir, the son of Ceallach, equipped with special powers of attorney and orders. According to these orders I was to appoint a small group of my commandos which was subject only to Cahir. The group was tasked with abducting from the island...",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"'Ceallach visited me, in despair, asking me for help for intercession, with his son, whom Emperor Emhyr has ordered captured, tortured and executed. To whom is a desperate father to turn to, if not a relative? Mawr, Ceallach's wife, the mother of Cahir, is my niece, my sister's youngest daughter. Despite this, I promised nothing. Because I cannot do anything in this case.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Let me explain it to you. But first, let me hear the information I asked you to collect.' Fringilla secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She was afraid that her friend wanted to get involved in the business of Cahir, the son of Ceallach, a matter that smelled of the scaffold. And if she had been asked for help, she would not be able to refuse. 'About mid-July,' she began, 'the entire court of Loc Grim had the opportunity to admire a fifteen year old girl, who was allegedly the princess of Cintra, which, during the audience, Emhyr portrayed as the queen and treated her so graciously, that rumours spread about the imminent marriage.' 'I heard,' Assire stroke the cat, which had become discouraged that Fringilla would not move, considered the possibility of getting into another chair, 'that there is still talk about this undoubtedly political marriage.' 'But in lower voices and less often.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Was he appointed Secretary of State? Head of the Department of Impossible Tasks?' 'No. They threw him in the dungeon a week later.' 'I'm afraid I don't understand what this has to do with Cahir, son of Ceallach.' 'Patience. Let me do this is order, It is necessary.' 'Sorry. I'm listening.' 'Do you remember what Emhyr gave us three years ago when we began to look?' 'A lock of hair.' 'Right.' Fringilla reached into her purse.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"I have examined them and there is no doubt about it.' 'I imagined a revelation of this kind,' Assire admitted, 'as soon as I heard that the Cintran had been isolated in Darn Rowan. The astrologer either failed to find the correct subject or was pulled into a conspiracy to provide a fake person to Emhyr. The conspiracy that will cost the head of Cahir aep Ceallach. Thank you, Fringilla. Everything is clear.' 'Not everything,' the black-haired sorceress shook her head.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Yesterday with his bare hands, he pulled a horseshoe out of red hot coals, before my eyes...' 'A wizard?' 'No,' Regis said from behind Pegasus, giving evidence of exceptionally sensitive hearing. 'Is it that important? I do not ask for your personal details.' 'I am Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.' 'Thank you and I am full of admiration,' the surgeon's voice held a hint of mockery. 'as that Nilfgaardian name was pronounced with almost no accent.' 'I'm not...' 'Enough!' Milva cut him off. 'There is no time to argue and dawdle.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"This man will tell the Geralt when he meets with him, that we are going the wrong way. Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.' 'Indeed, a revelation.' The surgeon's voice softened. 'And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?' 'That is a long story.' *** Dandelion had been silent a long time when one of the soldiers set to guard them broke off his conversation in mid curse, slurring, a second one groaning. Geralt know that that there were three of them, so he listened, but the third soldier issued no sound. He waited with bated breath.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"'But in time he will finally use his brain. He may even draw a valid conclusion. That the only activity that a man does alone is masturbation.' Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach remained tactfully silent. 'Let the plague take you all,' the Geralt said finally waving a spoon indignantly. 'May the devil take you, you idiots cooperating in your groups united by a common goal, which none of you understand.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood. He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"Along the way the poet had composed a heroic song, in which military rhymes and melodies resonated and was reminiscent of their recent adventures. The shape of the work clearly suggested that during these adventures, the author of the song and performer had shown himself to be the bravest of the brave. The procession was capped off by Milva and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. Cahir was riding his recovered horse and led by the bridle a gray horse loaded with their modest equipment. At last they left the riverside wetlands and found themselves on dry lands covered with hills from which they could see to the south the Great Yaruga as a shiny ribbon and to the north in the distance, the Mahakam Mountains.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"But he did not finish the move. On his forearm shone a silver scorpion. 'Cahir!' he cried in amazement. 'Cahir aep Ceallach!' 'Morteisen...' Cahir, stretched on the ground, said in a voice no less astonished. A dwarvern mercenary, who ran alongside Geralt, dressing in a doublet that was burned and charred, lost no time in amazement at all.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Ceallach
"*** The spell of teleprojection was tricky, the sorcerers were to speak with one voice, by joining hands and thoughts. Even then, it turned out to be a devilishly strenuous exercise, partly because the distance was so considerable. The clenched eyelids of Philippa Eilhart quivered, Triss Merigold panted, and sweat beads ran down the high forehead of Keira Metz. Only the face of Margarita Laux-Antille expressed no fatigue. The small room plunged into semi-lit darkness, suddenly, a mosaic of light began to dance along the dark wood paneling.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"The image flickered several times, it started to lose its vague picture and unnatural glow, the contours and colours became more acute. The sorceresses were now carefully observing the silhouette that was facing them. Triss bit her lip and glanced at Keira. The woman within the projection was pale and her complexion was ugly. She had bland, expressionless eyes, narrow bluish lips and a slightly hooked nose.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"I, Philippa Eilhart, the mistress of this castle, as hostess and instigator of this meeting will handle the introductions. To my right, Margarita Laux-Antille, the head of the Academy of Aretuza. To my left, Triss Merigold, of Maribor, and Keira Metz, of Carreras. Next, we have Sabrina Glevissig, of Ard Carraigh and Sheala Tancarville of Creyden, representing Kovir. Then Francesca Findabair, known as Enid an Gleanna, the current ruler of the Valley of Flowers.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"I'm sorry, but I do not see myself in that role. Having finished her speech, Assire leant, as if to lay her hand on something that was not in the projection. Triss thought she heard meowing. She has a cat! whispered Keira Metz.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"And yet we know how our fellow sorcerers are treated in Nilfgaard. We talk of being apolitical, but when Nilfgaard wins and we find ourselves under Imperial power, we will all look like ... Triss moved uneasily, Philippa let out a barely audible sigh. Keira looked down, Sheala pretended to adjust her boa. Francesca bit her lip.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"Even if it is a game, let's put our trust in it.' 'And if this is provocation?' 'You know better than I the people involved in this.' Enid an Gleanna reflected. 'Sile de Tansarville,' she said at last, 'is a secretive recluse, she has no political connections. Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"The magicians from the north were beautiful, charming and sparkled with jewellery, but in their eyes, gently emphasized by makeup, there was no hint of either drugs or nymphomania. None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
Sabrina Glevissig face was covered in unbounded astonishment. Keira Metz dropped the oyster knife onto the ice. Triss Merigold gasped loudly. Three sorceresses came through the portal. Three elves.,Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes. 'And Scoia'tael hidden in the basement.' Keira Metz muttered. Triss froze her with a glare. Philippa made the introductions. Fringilla stared curiously at Francesca Findabair, Enid an Gleanna, Daisy of the Valley, the famous Queen of Dol Blathanna, ruler of the elves who had recently regained their country.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"Fringilla sat beside Assire var Anahid, the right hand chair was free, separating her from Sile de Tansarville beside her was Sabrina Glevissig and Keira Metz. To the left of Assire sat Ida Emean, Francesca Findabair and Yennefer. And exactly opposite of Assire was Philippa Eilhart, who to her right sat Margarita Laux-Antille and to her left Triss Merigold. All of the chairs had armrests carved in the shape of sphinxes. Philippa started.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira
"A young girl, suitable for a young prince. A girl who can give birth, because this is about a dynasty. That sets the bar and excludes you, Philippa and excludes me, it even excludes Keira and Triss, the youngest among us. It also excludes all adepts from my school, which, after all, are not very interesting because the buds of the petals are still of an unknown colour, it is unthinkable that any one of them could sit with us as at the empty place at this table as the twelfth. In other words, even if the whole of Kovir goes mad and was willing to accept the king's marriage to a sorceress, a sorceress can not be found.",Baptism of Fire,Triss,Keira

"According to these orders I was to appoint a small group of my commandos which was subject only to Cahir. The group was tasked with abducting from the island... a certain person.'

We sailed the boat into caverns beneath the island.",Baptism of Fire,Cahir,Rience
"At some point Vilgefortz disappeared, the Rience disappeared and soon after them Enid an Gleanna. The last disappearance I took as the definitive signal to retreat.

I did not want to issue the order until the return of Cahir and his group, who had at the beginning of the action gone to perform his mission.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Cahir
"Although he has a position, he is nobody. 'Stefan Skellen,' Ida Emean said slowly, 'was also here to see us, where he had more luck. He spoke with Filavandrel and Vanadain.' 'And just like Vattier to me, he asked about Vilgefortz, Yennefer, Rience and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach?' 'Among other things. You would be amazed, but what interested him was the original version of the prophecy of Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, especially the passages that speak of Aen Hen Ichaer, The Elder Blood. He was also interested in Tor Lara, the Tower of Gulls, and the legendary portal that once connected the Tower of Gulls to Tor Zireael, the Swallow's Tower.",Baptism of Fire,Vilgefortz,Cahir
"This is Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda, Caleb Stratton, Figgis Merluzzo and Percival ... Schuttenbach. Percival Schuttenbach was not a dwarf. From under his wet hood, instead of a tangled beard, protruded a very long and pointed nose, reliably identifying the nationality of the holder to be that of the old and noble race of gnomes. And the others,  Zoltan Chivay pointed to the nearby group who had caught up and stopped not far away.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome. Although his size and stature was smaller than that of the dwarves, he had equal the amount of strength and his agility far surpassed theirs. During the march he ran around tirelessly, rummaging in the bushes, darting forward and disappearing, then suddenly emerging nervously, making monkey gestures from a distance giving a sign that everything was okay, they could go on.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"They did not stumble upon the army, and saw no smoke or fire. However, they were not alone. Scout Percival reported to them several times about groups of refugees hiding in the forest. They passed several such groups, and quickly at that, because the peasants, armed with pitchforks and stakes did not encourage them to make contact. It was suggested, however, to try to negotiate with them and leave the group of women from Kernow, but Zoltan was opposed to it and Milva supported him.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"The dwarves rested, but remained active. Figgis Merluzzo and Munro Bruys went in search of mushrooms. Zoltan, Yazon Yarda, Caleb Stratton and Percival Schuttenbach sprawled not far from the cart and played 'Screwed', their favourite card game, to which they devoted every free moment, even on wet evenings. The Geralt sometimes sat and played with them and encouraged them, as he did now. He still could not understand the complicated rules of the game, but he was fascinated by the cards themselves, which were beautifully and meticulously painted.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"He cursed as he ran, because once again he felt the pain through his knee. Just behind him rushed Zoltan Chivay, seizing his sword wrapped in its skins on the cart. Percival Schuttenbach and the rest of the dwarves ran after them, armed with their clubs and at the back Dandelion followed, who'd been awakened by the screaming. From one side, Figgis and Munro appeared. Throwing their baskets of mushrooms down, both dwarves caught the fleeing children.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Do not argue with a specialist Zoltan. said Dandelion. Percival Schuttenbach made his way to the cart and in the blink of an eye provided the required items. The Geralt winked at the company, then with all his strength began banging the spoon on the lid. Enough!",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Geralt listened with interest, shared his own experiences, and took the opportunity to enrich his knowledge asking about this and that, examining and testing Zoltan's sihill. He did not know that the very next day he would have to demonstrate the theory with practice. The first sign that people lived in the area, was a very regular stack of bark chips, which Percival Schuttenbach had spotted by the road while he was at the front of the group. Zoltan stopped the procession and sent the gnome to scout further. Percival disappeared, and after half an hour he returned at full speed, excited and breathless, waving from afar.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"On the contrary, they were casually dressed in colourful clothes, and their equipment gave the impression of being completely mismatched - not taken from the barracks, but found on the battlefield. Thirteen. Percival Schuttenbach counted quickly. Who are they? They aren't Nilfgaard or any other regular army,  said Zoltan.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"At the sight of the armed dwarves, they abandoned their feast in a panic. Only one man and a dog remained, neither of which showed any terror, they continued to tear flesh from the ribcage of the carrion. Zoltan and Percival tried to interrogate the man, but failed to learn anything. The man only groaned, shuddered, put his head between his arms and continued to strip the bones of its remains. The dog barked and bared its teeth to the gums.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"O, what?' 'The river.' Zoltan replied calmly. 'It flows into the Chotla. It is called O.' 'Ahh...' 'Oh, no!' Percival Schuttenbach laughed, shaking his head. 'A flows into the Chotla upstream, well away from here. This is O, not A.' The ravine, through which the river, with the complicated name ran, was overgrown with nettles which reached above the heads of the dwarves, they had an overwhelming smell of mint and rotten wood and resounded with the constant croaking of frogs.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Face it Zoltan, we have been lucky as hell that nobody has discovered or pursued us. If we had to run, we could do nothing but leave the cart with all of your packs and sacks. ' The dwarf snorted angrily into his beard, but surprisingly Percival Schuttenbach supported the troubadour. Support, the Geralt saw, which was accompanied by several significant winks. It was assumed the winks were to be stealthy, but the exaggerated pantomime of the little gnome's face excluded discretion.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Dandelion also seated a child on Pegasus, and Zoltan, took two on his chestnut stallion, as he walked alongside holding the reins. But the pace did not increase; the women of Kernow were in no condition to go faster. *** It was almost evening, when after hours of wandering among the gorges and ravines, Zoltan Chivay stopped and exchanged a few words with Percival Schuttenbach, after which he turned to the rest of the company. 'Do not worry and do not laugh at me.' He said. 'But it seems that I have gotten us lost.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"I will be silent. Let us hear what you propose as someone who is familiar with the forest.' Zoltan slapped the parrot on the head, cursing, his finger got caught in a lock of his beard, he pulled at it furiously. 'Percival?' 'We roughly know the desired direction.' The gnome looked at the sun, hanging just above the treetops. 'The first proposal is this: We turn around and walk away from the mud to dry ground and go through Fen Carn, following the river to the Chotla.' 'What about the other plan?' 'The O is shallow. Although after the recent rains it carries more water than normal, it can be easily forded.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"If you went into the mossy forest would the event repeat?' 'It is well we turned back.' He answered curtly. 'I do not have the slightest desire to repeat that nightmare.' *** 'You're welcome.' Zoltan shook his head while looking around. 'We've gotten to a charming place, Percival.' 'Fen Carn,' muttered the gnome, scratching the tip of his long nose. 'The Meadow of the Tombs... I always wondered where the name came from...' 'Now you know.' The broad valley before them was covered in the evening mist.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Fen Carn, while I've never been here, if something dangerous had occurred, I would have heard about it.' No one made a comment, not even Field Marshal Duda. The Kernow women took their children, sat down in a tight crowd, silent and clearly frightened. Percival and Dandelion tethered the horse and let them to graze on lush grass. Geralt, Zoltan and Milva approached the edge of the meadow, watching the cemetery that sank into the shadows and mists. 'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"'There is no one,' Zoltan said, looking around. 'Not a soul. It was a hallucination, Percival. A false alarm. You've stirred up fear where none was needed; you really do deserve a kick in the ass.' 'I saw it!' The gnome persisted.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"'I told you a distillation...' 'Moonshine.' Zoltan correctly him indignantly. 'And what a residue. Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"We want to drink, but it drips like a running nose.' 'The distillate is cool enough. The spirit will come out warm.' 'Never mind that, the night is cold.' The liquor stimulated conversation. Dandelion, Zoltan and Percival were flushed, their voices had changed even more – in the case of the poet and the gnome it came out a lisp. They grew hungry and chewed on cold horse meat and horseradish, which was in the hut in decent supply. The alchemist collected a mass of roots as strong as the liquor and they were reduced t tears.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"'Iron, steel and metallurgy! Blast furnaces, not some shitty chimney. Water and steam hammers...' 'Here, Percival, wet your whistle.' Zoltan passed the gnome a full cup. 'You'll bore us all with your techniques. But not everyone knows that Mahakam exports steel.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"I have no desire to spend the rest of my years down the mine. Forty years on the bottom, breathing methane was enough. But we have other plans, right, Percival? We already have a secured future...' 'Future, future...' The gnome emptied the cup, blew his nose and looked at the dwarf with his bleary eyes. 'Do not say a peep, Zoltan.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"I had a whole pile...' 'Do you hear that, Geralt?' Zoltan waved his arms in the air, almost knocking himself over on his back. 'He dreams of a heap of diamonds. Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep! He may take your diamonds.' 'Dreams, dreams,' Dandelion stammered again. 'And you, Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots. All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring. However, when the mist had been dispelled and the red ball of the sun blazed on the crown of the pines and larches of Fen Carn, the company was on its way, marching swiftly among the tombs.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"For you I've picked the prettiest flowers.' 'Thank you.' said Milva with a sad voice. 'We all thank you.' Zoltan repeated. 'Hey, Percival, you disgusting underground goblin, give the child a present. Something to remember us by. Do you have in your pockets a worthless stone?' 'I have, here, young lady.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"'And drink. Let's go down to the river.' 'Maybe we will be able to find some hot food.' Dandelion said. 'Percival, take a tour of the camp and make use of your nose. We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry. 'Did you find something to eat?' The gnome blew his nose and wiped his fingers on the fleece of a sheep returning from the river. 'I found it.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Such a procedure makes sense for wolves, allowing the individual to survive healthier and stronger. But among intelligent races such selection usually allows the dominant and biggest bastards to survive. Analyze this how you want.' Dandelion objected violently, and started to protest and bring forth cases of price gouging and utilitarianism by dwarves, but Zoltan and Percival drowned him out by imitating the sounds of a raspberry, which was considered by both races as a sign of contempt for the opponent's arguments in the dispute. An end was put to the dispute by the sudden appearance of a group of peasants led by the famous vampire hunter, the old man in the felt hat. 'We are here about Clog.' said one of the peasants.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"Only four people had not joined in the general panic, and one of which was against his will. The latter was the priest, his neck stuck in an iron grip by the Mayor Hector Laabs. The two other people were Zoltan and Percival. The gnome with a quick movement pulled up the back of the priest's robe, the dwarf armed with pincers pulled from the fire a burning horseshoe and threw it down the pants of the priest. Released from Laabs grip, the priest rushed forward like a comet with a smoking tail, and his screams were drowned in the roar of the crowd.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"The encampment was a smoking ruin after the assault, but it appeared the peasants who survived did not flee too far. Mounted soldiers with lilies on their shields pushed them to form groups, shouting at them. Milva, Zoltan, Percival and Regis were nowhere to be seen. Next to them sat the hero of the recent witch trial, the black cat, staring impassively at Geralt with golden eyes. The Geralt was somewhat surprised, usually cats did not like to be any proximity of him.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"The guard were professional soldiers, it was possible for them to communicate using compound sentences with pronouns exclusively filthy and disgusting. 'Geralt?' 'What?' 'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis... Did you see?' 'No. I have not ruled out that during the fighting they were cut down or trampled by horses.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"I have not ruled out that during the fighting they were cut down or trampled by horses. There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself. Even if they survived, they cannot help us.' 'Why?' 'For three reasons.",Baptism of Fire,Percival,Zoltan
"I regret that we meet as teleprojections, however, due to the times and the distances between us, a real meeting would have been impossible.

Triss Merigold and Keira Metz have them, but are now both in exile because king Foltest expelled all the sorceresses from Temeria. Margarita Laux-Antille is only interested in her school and nothing else. Of course, at this moment the last three are strongly influenced by Philippa and Philippa is a mystery. Sabrina Glevissig has not surrendered her political influence, which is in Kaedwen, but will not betray the Lodge.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Sabrina
"Her skin was dry from the compression and was still unbearably itchy. 'Who else is part of this Lodge? Apart from you and Philippa?' 'Margarita Laux-Antille, Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, Sile de Tansarville of Kovir, Sabrina Glevissig and two Nilfgaardian sorceresses.' 'Is this the international republic of females?' 'You could call it that.' 'They probably still consider me Vilgefortz accomplice. Will they accept me?' 'They have accepted me. The rest you will have to do yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Sabrina
"None had exposed her breasts. On the contrary, two of them had dresses up to their neck – austere, black-clad Sile de Tansarville and young Triss Merigold with beautiful blue eyes and auburn hair. The brunette Sabrina Glevissig and the blond Margarita Laux-Antille and Keira Metz wore necklines down to their cleavage, but not much deeper than Fringilla's own. Waiting for the other participants of the convent gave them time to talk, during which all had the opportunity to say something about themselves and with tactful statements and comments Philippa Eilhart quickly and deftly broke the ice, although the only ice in the area was piled on a mountain of oysters. Other ice was not palpable.",Baptism of Fire,Margarita,Sabrina

"She will go right...' 'Nonsense,' Triss Merigold interrupted, looking at Francesca and Ida Emean. 'Yennefer will not betray us. Nothing says that Yennefer fled in order to betray us.'

Keira looked down, Sheala pretended to adjust her boa. Francesca bit her lip. Assire var Anahid's face did not flinch, but was covered with a slight blush.",Baptism of Fire,Keira,Francesca
"Tell me, Enid.' 'Your Geralt,' said Francesca, 'during only one hour did more than many do throughout their whole lives. In short: He broke Dijkstra's leg, cut off the head of Artuad Terranova and brutal killed about ten Scoia'tael. Oh, and not forgetting, awakening an unhealthy desire in Keira Metz.' 'Horrible,' Yennefer exaggeratedly wrinkled her brow. 'But Keira has since come to her senses, right? She does not hold a grudge, I hope.",Baptism of Fire,Keira,Francesca
"And Lady Ida Emean aep Sivney, Aen Saevherne of the Blue Mountains.' Ida Emean bowed her head with her red hair slightly, her flowing dress rustled. 'I suppose,' Francesca looked around, 'that we are complete.' 'We are missing only Vilgefortz.' Sabrina Glevissig said softly but with evident anger, while watching Yennefer with piercing eyes.

"After some thought, Zoltan Chivay ordered that there be room left for the children to sit. The command was carried out with hesitation – Geralt noticed that the refugees kept their distance from the dwarves and were reluctant to give up the children. Dandelion watched with evident disgust as two dwarves tried on clothes pulled from the corpses. The others prowled among the carts, but found nothing they considered worthy of taking. Zoltan Chivay whistled on his fingers, signaling it was time to end the salvaging, then he cast a professional eye over Roach, Pegasus, and Milva's black bay.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Zoltan Chivay licked his lips in response, and told her he was a master at preparing horsemeat, which infuriated Milva even more. They had maintained a regular formation, and at the centre they pulled the cart. Zoltan marched in front of the cart, Dandelion rode next to him on Pegasus and quarrelled with the parrot. Geralt and Milva followed, and behind them dragged the six women from Kernow. The guide was Percival Schuttenbach, the long-nosed gnome.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Geralt attributed the behavior of the women to the tragedy they had recently survived, but he suspected that the reason for their reserve could be the fairly liberal manners of the dwarves. Zoltan and his company swore obscenely and often and the parrot, Field Marshal Duda, had an even richer repertoire. They sang bawdy songs, valiantly supported by Dandelion. They spat, blew their noses in their fingers and farted loudly, which was usually followed by laughter, jokes and competitions. They only took the trouble to go deep into the bushes for larger commissions, and for lighter ones, they did not bother to go that far.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"It seemed to be highly effective, as everyone obediently and meekly started going to the toilet in the bushes. In order to not be seen as treacherous conspirators, however, they went in groups. The new company had completely changed Dandelion meanwhile. The poet fit in with the dwarves like a brother, especially when it appeared that some of them had heard of him before and knew a few verses of his ballads.

"Well, okay. Said Zoltan. Dandelion blurted everything. He must have felt that we appreciate honesty, and that we are sympathetic towards you. He did not need to test us, because we do not hide our nature.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"No need,  Geralt rubbed his knee, which after a few days the pain had still not abandoned. Keep your advice, Zoltan. He found Dandelion playing cards with the cheering dwarves. Without a word, he took the poet's sleeve and pulled him into the forest. Dandelion immediately realized what was going on, one look at the Geralt's face was enough.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"I'd be happy to eat it. Zoltan is right,  said Milva. And you be quiet, Dandelion, because its not poetic. If there's milk in the oatmeal, then there is a cow. And any peasant, would have noticed the fumes of the fires, taken his cow and escaped into the woods.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Black smallpox ... Did you touch anything? Zoltan Chivay retreated abruptly, almost knocking Dandelion over. Did you touch anything in the yard? No...",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan

"'His accent was barely noticeable, but some refugees hiding in the woods, may have recognized...' Milva looked down. 'I should have killed him then, Geralt.' She said quietly. 'He would have had a lighter death.' 'He escaped from the coffin,' Dandelion nodded, looking at Geralt meaningfully, 'just to rot in a ditch.' Thus was pronounced the epitaph to Cahir, the son of Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who emerged from a coffin, who claimed that he was not Nilfgaardian. They spoke about him no more. Geralt - despite repeated threats – decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"And people. 'We have to look.' Zoltan Chivay decided, putting an end to discussions about risks and dangers. 'Let's get closer.' 'Why the hell,' Dandelion raised his voice, 'do you want to look at those hanged men, Zoltan? For loot? I can see from here that they have no boots.' 'You're an idiot.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Strategy, which jumps out of the bushes, I leave to dwarves. And hanging from an oak, too.' Zoltan waved his hand and walked to the tree. Dandelion who could not resist his curiosity, spurred on Pegasus, and went after the dwarf. Geralt, after a moment's reflection, followed them. Milva trailed after him.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'They need to guard their wives and daughters.' Milva growled. 'The monsters are aware that there are horny soldiers in the procession, and they would not let even a sheep pass. And if they put clothing on a willow tree, it would be just them and the knot hole.' Dandelion, who had no longer lost his humour and talkativeness, tightened the strings on his lute and began to compose a couplet to the use of willows, lustful soldiers and knot holes; the dwarf and the parrot competed in helping with the rhymes. *** 'O.' Zoltan said. 'What?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'Rrrrurr... Mother!' Field Marshal Duda croaked, creating a chorus counterpoint to Zoltan and his company. *** 'Truth be told,' Dandelion said, eyeing the remains of the cart and the luggage strewn about it. 'It was a happy accident. Your creaky cart was slowing down the march.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Figgis and Yazon are blacksmiths, and spoke of a forge. Caleb Stratton wants to get married but his bride's parents expelled him once for being penniless. And Zoltan...' 'Stop, Dandelion. Gossiping is for women.' 'I apologize, Milva.' 'There is no need to.' Once they cross the river, the dark damp strip of trees became more spares and turned into low birch trees and dry grassland. Despite this, they rode slowly.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Despite this, they rode slowly. They followed the example of Milva, who immediately after leaving the forest, place a freckled little girl with braids into her saddle. Dandelion also seated a child on Pegasus, and Zoltan, took two on his chestnut stallion, as he walked alongside holding the reins. But the pace did not increase; the women of Kernow were in no condition to go faster. *** It was almost evening, when after hours of wandering among the gorges and ravines, Zoltan Chivay stopped and exchanged a few words with Percival Schuttenbach, after which he turned to the rest of the company.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan

'To make matters worse, today the moon is full,' muttered the dwarf.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'Or a spirit?' 'It might work.' 'On my Sihil,' Zoltan growled, barring his sword, 'are etched dwarven runes to an ancient dwarven spell. Any ghoul that gets within the reach of my sword will remember me. You'll see.' 'Ha.' Dandelion exclaimed who during their conversation had approached them. 'So there are the famous secret dwarven runes. What is on the sword?' ' Go fuck the motherfuckers.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Try it, Percival.' 'But I do not understand organic chemistry.' The gnome said distractedly, on his knees examining the details of the construction of the alchemical stove. 'It is doubtful I would recognize the ingredients...' 'It is a distillation of Alraune,' Regis dispelled his doubts, 'with the addition of belladonna. The alcohol fermentation enzymes I used...' 'In other words, yeast?' 'You could call it that.' 'Are there any glasses around here?' 'Zoltan, Dandelion.' The Geralt stood with his hands folded across his chest. 'Are you deaf? The moonshine is made of mandrake.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"For one pound of yeast I get five ounces of Alraune and only half an ounce of belladonna...' 'It is not about that.' Zoltan looked at the Geralt, he understood the point, he turned serious and carefully backed away from the stove. 'It is not that, Mister Regis, but about how much the Alraune costs. It is too expensive a drink for us.' 'Mandragora.' Dandelion whispered admiringly, pointing to the towering pile in a corner booth resembling small bulbs of sugar beets. 'This is mandrake? True mandrake?' 'The female variety,' said the alchemist.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"When she learned of Regis's hospitality, she initially shrugged, but it did not take long to convince her. When they entered the hut, they found the company inspecting the stored mandrake roots. 'This is the first time I've seen one,' said Dandelion, turning the branched root in his hands. 'They are indeed, somewhat reminiscent of a man.' 'Twisted by back pain.' Zoltan said. 'And the other, looks like a pregnant woman.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"There is no reason for concern.' 'Of course not,' Zoltan said. 'You can even run it through nettles, fish scales and old lace. Give me the cup, Dandelion, because you're holding up the queue.' The cup started moving again. Everyone sat comfortably on the trampled ground. The Geralt hissed and swore under his breath.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'It is easy to fall into mannerisms and start using those words every day. The people around them then consider them a pompous fool.' 'Or by an alchemist.' Said Zoltan, pouring another cup. 'Or by a Geralt,' snorted Dandelion, 'who has been reading, in order to impress a certain sorceress. The sorceresses, gentlemen, do not go crazy for convoluted far-fetched tales. Am I right, Geralt?",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Come on, tell us...' 'Skip a few rounds, Dandelion,' interrupted the Geralt coldly. 'Some of the alkaloids have started to act too quickly on you. You talk too much.' 'I might end up with those secrets of yours, Geralt.' Zoltan frowned 'Dandelion has told us nothing new. You can't avoid being a walking legend. The stories of your adventures are played in puppet theaters.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"We want to drink, but it drips like a running nose.' 'The distillate is cool enough. The spirit will come out warm.' 'Never mind that, the night is cold.' The liquor stimulated conversation. Dandelion, Zoltan and Percival were flushed, their voices had changed even more – in the case of the poet and the gnome it came out a lisp. They grew hungry and chewed on cold horse meat and horseradish, which was in the hut in decent supply. The alchemist collected a mass of roots as strong as the liquor and they were reduced t tears.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"But it added fire to the discussion. Regis showed surprise when it turned out that the final purpose of the journey was not an area in the mountains of Mahakam, which had long been the home of the dwarves. Zoltan, who had become even more talkative than Dandelion, said he would not return under any circumstance to Mahakam, venting his displeasure of the order prevailing there, particularly in regards to the politics and the governor, Brouver Hogg who had absolute power over the dwarven clans. 'Old fart!' He yelled and spat into the coals of the stove. 'When you look at him it is hard to tell if he is alive or stuffed.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"The edge was rimmed with jasper and the base was made of gold. A veritable wonder...' 'Do not give him more spirits.' Zoltan said. 'What a minute,' Dandelion said with interest, also mumbling. 'What happened to this legendary grail?' 'I traded it for a mule. I needed a mule to carry the load...",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Nobody!' 'I have not heard anything,' Zoltan said, looking boldly at the Geralt. 'It seems I have an earwig in my ear.' 'These earwigs are a real pest,' said Regis, pretending to poke in his ear. 'We travel to Nilfgaard...' Dandelion rested on the dwarf. It should have helped him maintain balance, but instead proved to be highly unstable. 'But it as I said, a secret.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"The cold morning woke up and energized the revellers, but was not completely able to eliminate the effects of the mandrake moonshine. Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap. Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed. Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots. All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"All five betrayed clear, although different symptoms of fatigue, as well as an intense desire to quench their thirst at the spring. However, when the mist had been dispelled and the red ball of the sun blazed on the crown of the pines and larches of Fen Carn, the company was on its way, marching swiftly among the tombs. Regis led, behind him followed Percival and Dandelion, singing a song about three sisters and an iron wolf. Behind them stomped Zoltan Chivay, leading his chestnut stallion by the bridle. The dwarf had found in the hut of the surgeon a gnarled piece of ash wood, which he was banging against the menhirs, as he passed he wished the long dead elves, eternal rest.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'What do you think of their vampire?' Zoltan Chivay asked the Geralt. 'Do you believe their story?' 'I have not seen the victims. I can not say anything in advance.' 'It is obviously nonsense,' Dandelion said with conviction. 'The peasants said the victims had been torn apart. Vampires don't do this; they bite into an artery and suck the blood, leaving behind two clear signs of fangs.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Two of the women from Kernow who had been traveling with them had found in the camp their husband and his brother, who they had thought had died or disappeared without a trace during the maelstrom of war. The joy and tears were endless. 'Something as trivial and melodramatic,' Dandelion said with conviction, pointing his finger at the touching scene, 'can only happen in real life. If I tried to finish one of my romances this way, I would be made fun of mercilessly.' 'Inevitably,' Zoltan confirmed. 'Although all are glad of something so banal.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'Do not confuse the child, she will not remember anyway.' 'Oh lovely! Green! Thank you very, very much!' 'Take care.' 'And don't lose it.' Dandelion muttered. 'Because that stone is worth a much as a small farm.' 'Bah,' Zoltan said, planting on the bonnet of flowers he received from the girl. 'A stone is a stone, what else can you say.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"We can eat where there are the best cooks.' To their surprise, the way to the river was fenced and guarded and those guarding the river demanded a penny per horse. Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them. Surprisingly, it was Dandelion who dug up a few coins from the bottom of his pocket. Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry. 'Did you find something to eat?' The gnome blew his nose and wiped his fingers on the fleece of a sheep returning from the river.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"And on top of that there isn't any grass around here. With the local circumstances there is nothing we can do. We could haggle with the peasant selling the oats and have Dandelion give him the rest of his money. Or from Zoltan and his parrot, he could receive a nasty stream of abuse, which, of course would do nothing. Bu the horses are eager to get their heads in a bag of feed.' 'Bloody rip off!' Cried the dwarf, venting his anger with blows of his stick on the passing wheels of the carts.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Such a procedure makes sense for wolves, allowing the individual to survive healthier and stronger. But among intelligent races such selection usually allows the dominant and biggest bastards to survive. Analyze this how you want.' Dandelion objected violently, and started to protest and bring forth cases of price gouging and utilitarianism by dwarves, but Zoltan and Percival drowned him out by imitating the sounds of a raspberry, which was considered by both races as a sign of contempt for the opponent's arguments in the dispute. An end was put to the dispute by the sudden appearance of a group of peasants led by the famous vampire hunter, the old man in the felt hat. 'We are here about Clog.' said one of the peasants.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'We had the notion to marrying him off.' 'I have nothing against it,' Zoltan said angrily. 'I wish him happiness in his new way of life. Health, happiness and prosperity.' 'And lots of small Clogs' Dandelion said. 'No, no, gentlemen,' said the peasant 'Do not laugh, how are supposed to marry him? After you knocked him in the head his mind is completely addled, he can not even distinguish between day and night.' 'Well, that doesn't sound so bad after all,' Milva said, looking at the ground.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"The self-satisfied leaders have renounced the gods, expelled the priests who held positions on their councils, and replaced them with witches who were awarded with honours and gold! And here is the result!' 'Aha! Herein lies the vampire.' Dandelion said. 'You're wrong Regis. This is about politics, not vaginas.' 'And the money.' added Zoltan Chivay.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Did you see?' 'No. I have not ruled out that during the fighting they were cut down or trampled by horses. There in the camp, lay their bodies.' 'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice. 'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"'Milva! Regis!' Zoltan shouted, squeezing all. 'Dandelion, alive, albeit with a bandage on his head! And what do you have to say about this melodramatic cliché? Life, is not poetry!",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"Life, is not poetry! And you know why? Because it is not subjected to criticism!' 'And where is Caleb Stratton?' Dandelion said looking around. Zoltan and the other fell silent and suddenly became serious. 'Caleb,' the dwarf said at last, inhaling through his nose, 'lies under the ground next to a birch tree, away from his beloved mountain peaks and coal.",Baptism of Fire,Dandelion,Zoltan
"the local dynasties still rule there. Though only in appearance, of course.'   'They're called puppet-states', boasted Reef. 'I've heard the term.'   'The problem with Cintra, however, was that the royal line had been extinguished there...'   'Extinguished?' For a moment it looked as if green sparks were about to shoot from Ciri's  eyes. 'Extinguished due to the fact that the Nilfgaardians murdered Queen Calanthe! Nothing  but common murderers!'   'I confess', Hotsporn gestured for Giselher to reseat himself, because he had risen at Ciri's  repeated interference, 'that Miss Falka's knowledge continues to shine brilliantly here.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"Nothing  but common murderers!'   'I confess', Hotsporn gestured for Giselher to reseat himself, because he had risen at Ciri's  repeated interference, 'that Miss Falka's knowledge continues to shine brilliantly here. Queen  Calanthe has indeed fallen during the war. Also supposedly killed was Ciri, her  granddaughter, the last of the royal blood. So Emhyr did not have much to work with to  create, as Mr. Reef has so wisely identified, a puppet-state.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"How could she know what feelings had come over me when I  heard Hotsporn speak of Cintra, of my grandmother... Calanthe. When he assumed that any  'Ciri' would become the wife of the Emperor of Nilfgaard. The same Emperor who had  murdered my grandmother and had sent the black knight with the bird of prey wings on his  helmet after me. I've told you about him, remember?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"He looked at the Roach's  mane. 'Calanthe' he picked up the thread again, 'made a few knights take an oath just before she  jumped to her death. They were not to allow Ciri to fall into Nilfgaardian hands. During the  escape the knights were killed and Ciri was left alone in the midst of corpses and fires, in the  narrow streets of a burning city. She would not have escaped with her life, no doubt about  that.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"The sorcerers who were experimenting with the  descendants of Lara and Riannon, did not get their desired results and abandoned the  experiment. But the experiment continued, only now spontaneously. Ciri, Pavetta's daughter,  granddaughter of Calanthe and descendant of Riannon, a direct descendant of Lara Dorren. Vilgefortz probably learned this by chance. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard is  aware of this too.'   'And you know this too.'   'I actually know more than both of them.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"And she shows me a nice but very young girl. Do you know who  the girl is, Zuleyka? Ciri, Calanthe's granddaughter. Remember Calanthe, Zuleyka?'   'Of course I remember, my husband.'   'Ciri of Cintra,' Esterad continued talking, playing with the sceptre, 'is said to be  chosen to marry Emhyr of Nilfgaard. The Emperor's intention surprised everyone...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"Ten years ago. To the same person. Ciri, the granddaughter of  Calanthe. The lion cub of Cintra. I, Yennefer of Vengerberg, care for Ciri as my daughter.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"You should know I do not do this  for your sake. The Bloedgeas, the blood oath that I gave in front of Calanthe, practically  binds my hands. So if you plan to help Ciri, genuinely and honestly – which I assume is true  – it seems to me that I have no choice but to help you in this endeavour...'   'Thank you. But please spare me that pathetic tone. I repeat: I did not participate in the  conspiracy on Thanedd.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"Three  times. After the death of Adalia the Seer, after the death of Calanthe... And after the death  Pavetta, the mother of Ciri.'   'Pavetta' remarked Yennefer, 'was killed during a storm, so one can hardly say that...'   'Pavetta' interrupted Crach, still thoughtfully, 'was not killed during a storm. The assault  began after her death. The sea, as usual, responded to the death of someone of Cinterein  blood.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"And this led to a highly raised  nose – he challenged anyone to try to defeat him. And his challenge was accepted. By Ciri,  Pavetta's daughter from Cintra. She was not even one of the islanders, although she was  allowed because she had spent more time here than in Cintra.'   'Even after Pavetta's accident? I thought Calanthe had forbidden her to stay here?'   'You know about that?' He shot her a quick glance.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"'Then you know a lot Yennefer. A  lot. Calanthe's anger and bans lasted no longer than six months, and then Ciri once again  started to spend summers and winters here... and to skate. She was quick as hell, but that she  would compete with the other boys in 'Salmon Jumps'?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe
"Fortunately,  Hjalmar was stuck in there for a while, so they couldn't run off and do anything stupid...'   'How old were they then?'   'He was fifteen, she nearly twelve.'   'Your fears might have been exaggerated a little.'   'Perhaps. But Calanthe, who I had to tell all of it to, did not take the matter lightly. I know  she had wedding plans for Ciri, to join her with young Tancred Thyssen of Kovir or perhaps  to the Redanian prince, Radovid, I don't know exactly. But rumours can hurt marriage plans,  even rumours about innocent kissing or semi-innocent kissing... Calanthe immediately  brought Ciri back to Cintra.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Calanthe

"Specifically, experiments on human  embryos... and pregnant women. So if Vilgefortz had Ciri in his power, then I fear that the  continued search for her...'   'Shut up, damn it!'   'On the other hand,' Vattier de Rideaux hastily steered the conversation away, obeying  the unspoken order in the Emperor's angry eyes, 'it could all be disinformation. To discredit  the magician. That would be like Dijkstra.'   'You should remove him and find Vilgefortz and Ciri!",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"And against my master Vilgefortz?'   'Your insolence is disarming.'   'Hell, Vattier. I assure you that we are still on your side, myself and Vilgefortz. Well, I  confess we have betrayed you, because we gave you the wrong Ciri, but that was done in  good faith, may I be drowned if I lie. After the real one was gone, Vilgefortz figured wrong  was better than none. We thought you would not care...'   'Your insolence is not disarming, but insulting.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz

"'Of course the sorcerers poked their noses in. Deliberately combining selected people in  pairs, but eventually it got out of their control. Few could guess, how the genetic material  could be reborn so powerfully in Ciri and what was the trigger. I think Vilgefortz knows, the  same man who broke your bones at Thanedd.

"Well, if you have a knife to your throat...'   'Exactly. The Commission also thinks so. And thus has formulated the following  conclusion: Vilgefortz kidnapped Ciri, but had no other escape route, so he had to use the  emergency exit – he teleported with the girl to the Sedna-Depth, to a Nilfgaardian ship  waiting there. The Commission's conclusion is supported by the fact that Ciri was presented  at the imperial court in Loc Grim on the tenth of July, just ten days after the events on  Thanedd.'   'Well.' The Earl's eyes narrowed. 'That explains a lot.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"There is a chance... a  shadow of a chance... that Ciri was the one who travelled through the portal of Tor Lara. That  she escaped Nilfgaard and Vilgefortz...'   'Where is she then?'   'I would also like to know that.'      ***       It was devilishly dark out. The clouds clustered together to hide the moon behind them,  letting through almost no light.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Yennefer, Dijkstra has found some traces of... some  traces of certain activities have been found. If Vilgefortz does have Ciri, then the girl faces a  horrible death.'   'Be quiet, Triss,' Philippa Eilhart hissed sharply. 'We are not trading or bargaining.'   'I will leave you the information', Yennefer said slowly. 'I'll leave you the information on  what I've found and what I plan.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"And Bonhart? Bonhart is an unpredictable sadist. When he speaks of Ciri, his voice  trembles with anger. Depending on the discretion he would execute or kidnap the girl, to  make her fight in the arena. The deal with Vilgefortz?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"She saw another chair, a strange steel  structure on a stone pedestal. 'That,' she heard Vilgefortz's voice behind her . 'That little chair is for your Ciri. It has  waited a long time, it can wait no longer. Me neither.'   She could tell he was close, could almost feel his breath.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"But it could not.'   Yennefer was quite enmeshed in a web of silver and copper wires, surrounded by a  scaffolding of tubes made of silver and porcelain. Tripods mounted on the chair held glass  vials that fluctuated with colourless liquids. 'I've therefore concluded' – Vilgefortz pushed another tube into her nose, this time it was  made of glass – 'that the only way to locate Ciri is an empathic probe. For this, however, I  needed someone with whom the girl had a sufficiently strong emotional connection and has  developed an empathic matrix algorithm and mutual sympathy, to borrow a neologism. I  thought of the Geralt, but he has vanished, and also Geralts are unsuitable to use as  mediums.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"The sooner you start with the  locations, the sooner it's over. Well, Yennefer. Here on this screen, I want to see Ciri. Where  she is, whom she is with and what she is doing, along with where and with whom she is  sleeping.'   Yennefer screamed piercingly, wildly, desperately. 'It hurts,' Vilgefortz fixed both his living eye the dead crystal eye on her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Vilgefortz turned again to the megascope, where an  image appeared on the screen, produced by the giant crystal. 'That's all she located,' he said, pointing at the screen. 'I wanted Ciri and she has given  me the Geralt. She did not have the empathic matrix of the girl, but when she became weak  she gave me Geralt's. I would not have believed she had such deep feelings for him...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Since the world began, the night of the autumn equinox has also been a night of ghosts,  nightmare and apparitions, sudden awakening in the night, with breath and heartbeat caught  in fear, between sheets, twisted and wet with perspiration. The apparitions and awakenings  did not even spare the clearest of heads, in Nilfgaard, in the Towers of Gold, the emperor  himself, Emhyr var Emreis, woke up screaming. Far to the north in Lan Exeter, King Esterad  Thyssen jumped out of bed, waking his wife, Queen Zuleyka. In Tretogor, Dijkstra woke up  and reached for his knife, waking the Minister of Treasuries wife. In the palace of  Montecalvo, Philippa Eilhart jumped up from damask bed linens, without waking the wife of  Count de Noailles.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"He entered the room and stopped immediately, astonished. He bowed. 'Welcome, Dijkstra,' said Esterad Thyssen, King of Kovir, Poviss, Narok, Velhad and  Talgar. 'Do not stand at the door, come here, closer. Leave the labels outside; this is not an  official audience.'   'Your Majesty.'

"Leave the labels outside; this is not an  official audience.'   'Your Majesty.'   Esterad's wife, Queen Zuleyka, responded to his bow full of respect with a slight nod,  never for a moment pausing with her crocheting. Apart from the royal couple, there was not a soul in the room. 'That's right,' Esterad noticed his gaze, 'We'll talk in private, excuse me, just the six  eyes. I consider this to be the most sensible solution.'   Dijkstra sat in the chair that was opposite Esterad that was offered to him. The king wore  across his shoulders an ermine, crimson mantle, a jacket and a matching velvet hat.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"He    always looked sturdy and healthy, like a sailor who had just returned from sea, until it seemed  that he emanated a scent of cold seawater and salty wind. As with all Thyssens, it was  difficult to guess the exact age of the king. Looking at his hair, his complexion and hands,  places that clearly showed age, he could guess that Esterad was forty-five. But Dijkstra knew  that the king was fifty-six. 'Zuleyka,' the King leaned towards his wife.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"It was not secret that he loved her  immeasurably. Love, which for twenty-nine years of marriage had never waned, and still  clearly burned. Esterad, so it was claimed, had never betrayed Zuleyka ever. Dijkstra did not  think too much on something so unlikely, but he had more than three times tried to insert a  female agent into the king's favour, to gather information. Nothing had ever come of it.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"To buy all  of Nilfgaard?'   Dijkstra did not answer. Zuleyka crocheted with eagerness. Esterad during this time,  pretended to be admiring the naked nymph painted on the ceiling. 'Follow me,' he suddenly stood up and nodded to the spy. They went to a huge painting  showing King Gedovius sitting on a grey horse with a sceptre of the military pointing to  something not on the canvas, probably in the right direction.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Then the couples went off to their  own chambers and beds. The royal couple of Kovir in this regard were an exception. Esterad Thyssen and Zuleyka  always slept together in one bedroom in a huge bed with a huge canopy. Before bed, Zuleyka put on glasses, something she was ashamed to show in front of her  subjects and read the Good Book. Esterad Thyssen usually talked.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Esterad Thyssen usually talked. This night was no  different. Esterad put on his nightcap and took his sceptre in hand. He liked to hold the  sceptre and have fun with it, but did not do so in public because he feared his subjects would  call him pretentious. 'You know, Zuleyka,' he confided.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Do you know who  the girl is, Zuleyka? Ciri, Calanthe's granddaughter. Remember Calanthe, Zuleyka?'   'Of course I remember, my husband.'   'Ciri of Cintra,' Esterad continued talking, playing with the sceptre, 'is said to be  chosen to marry Emhyr of Nilfgaard. The Emperor's intention surprised everyone... How the  devil, could she become Tankred's wife?'   'Our Tankred,' the queen's voice was soft as always when talking about her son, 'needs a  woman.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"But these dreams...'   'The Good Book,' Zuleyka turned a few pages, 'says that when humans sleep, the gods  will open their ears and speak. Meanwhile, the Prophet Lebioda teaches that seeing a dream,  you see either great wisdom or great folly. The important thing is to know how to recognise  it.'    'The marriage of Tankred to Emhyr's promised bride seems like no great wisdom,'  Esterad sighed. 'And speaking of wisdom, I would be very happy if it came to me in a dream. It is the thing for which we gave been visited by Dijkstra.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Are you  listening, dear?'   'I hear you, husband.'   'And what do you say?'   'All wisdom is contained in the Good Book.'   'And does your Good Book says we would get a visit from Dijkstra asking for a million  linters?'   'The book,' Zuleyka blinked from behind her glasses, 'does not say anything about  unworthy mammon. But in one passage it says that it is more blessed to give than to receive  and helping the poor with charity is noble. It says – give to all, and it will make your soul  noble.'   'And great dinners fill graves,' Esterad Thyssen murmured. 'Zuleyka, apart from the  passages that deal with the noble soul, does the book share some wisdom on business? What  does the book say, for example about exchange of equivalent?'   The queen adjusted her glasses and quickly flicked through the pages.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"'I found,' she soon announced, something in the wisdom of the prophet Lebioda. Shall I  read it?'   'Please.'   'And the prophet Lebioda says: indeed, give to the poor in abundance. But instead of  giving to the poor all the melon, give him only half a melon, to the poor it will seem like  luck.'   'Half a melon,' snorted Esterad Thyssen. 'You mean half a million linters? You know,  Zuleyka that having half a million and not having half a million, it all adds up to a million?'    'You did not let me finish,' the queen chided her husband with a stern look over her  glasses.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"In this case you'll find happiness twice. You get rid of the cat and  your neighbour will rejoice. Because most of the time, the neighbour will not be pleased so  much with the gift, but knowing that he was gifted.'   Esterad was silent for some time, his forehead wrinkled. 'Zuleyka?' he asked at last. 'Is that the same prophet?'   'Take the stray cat...'   'I heard the first time!' cried the king, but immediately recovered.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"And for grandfather they were the  sly cats.'   'Then,' Guiscard Vermuellen murmured, 'grandfather took me by the hand and led me to  the terrace, where grandmother Zuleyka was feeding the seagulls. Grandpa said... said...'   The old man slowly and with effort tried to recall the words that eighty-five years ago  Esterad Thyssen said to his wife, Queen Zuleyka, on the terrace of the palace of Ensenada,  high above the Great Canal. 'You know, my dearest wife, I've seen another wisdom from the Prophet Lebioda? One  that will still give me an advantage over having donated my cats to Redania.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Cats always come home. And when my cats return, bringing home  their wages, their booty, their riches... I will tax those cats!'       ***      When King Esterad Thyssen spoke one last time with Dijkstra, he did so alone, without  even Zuleyka. On the floor of the giant ballroom, was a ten-year-old boy, but he did not count  because he was so busy playing with his tin soldiers to pay attention to any of the talking. 'This is Guiscard,' Esterad explained, pointing to the boy with a nod of his head, 'my  grandson, son of Gaudemunda and that rascal, Duke Vermuellen.",The Tower of the Swallow,Esterad,Zuleyka
"Grandfather shielded and protected Zuleyka  and only Zuleyka and did not care about himself. When at last help came, Zuleyka had not a  scratch. Esterad had received more than twenty stab wounds. He died after three hours  without regaining consciousness.'      ***      'Have you ever read the Good Book, Dijkstra?'   'No, Your Majesty. But I know what is written in there.'

"For  although Geralt had fought shoulder to shoulder with Cahir, and although he had stood at  his side, facing death, he still looked at the Nilfgaardian suspiciously and never considered  him with favour. Though he sought to hide his resentment, when a person is – as I have  probably already pointed out – as straightforward as a halberd shaft, it cannot be helped and  at every turn the antipathy crept out like an eel from a leaky bucket. The reason was obvious, and it was Ciri. As fate willed it I was on the island of Thanedd during the new moon in July, when the  bloody conflict between magicians broke out. On one side were sorcerers loyal to the kings,  on the other side were traitors incited by Nilfgaard.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"On one side were sorcerers loyal to the kings,  on the other side were traitors incited by Nilfgaard. The traitors were supported by the  Squirrels, rebellious elves – and by Cahir, son of Ceallach. Cahir had been sent to Thanedd  on a special mission – to capture and kidnap Ciri. When Ciri defended herself, she wounded  him – the sight of the scar on Cahir's hand always leaves my mouth dry. It must have hurt like  hell, and two of the fingers still cannot bend.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"And why he was entrusted with such a strange mission. A foreign mission, no less. Because Cahir had already attempted to kidnap Ciri. Nearly four years ago, during the  massacre in Cintra. That was the first time he felt providence, which rules the fate of this girl.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
I want the real Ciri! Now move your ass. Find me Ciri. Find Cahir. And  Vilgefortz.,The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"'You? What could  you give me? Perhaps the real Ciri? Maybe your boss, Vilgefortz? Perhaps Cahir aep  Ceallach?'   'Halt!' The illusion of Rience raised his illusory hand.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"You could have pulled back, but you  didn't want to. You stayed in the company. To save Ciri. Right?'   'Yes.'   'So, you will ride through the Sansretour Valley with Regis and Cahir. You will be in the  mountains waiting for us – do not exceed the borders of Toussaint yet.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"From the beginning, from that moment the company  was formed after eating the famous fish soup. When it enrolled in its ranks a Nilfgaardian. A  Nilfgaardian, who wants to bring Ciri into his power so he can pass her to his Emperor  Emhyr, because his life and future career depend on this...?'   'So I was not wrong,' Cahir said slowly. 'I am a traitor. A vicious, duplicitous traitor?'   'Geralt,' Regis rejoined the discussion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"Also, I ask all of you for  forgiveness, because it was cruel to make you watch and listen to it all.'   'I have omitted to Cahir and to you the reason for my anger, my rage, and my grief. They  stem from the fact that I know who betrayed us. I know who betrayed and kidnapped Ciri,  who we want to save. My anger stems from the fact that we are talking about a person who  was once very close to me.'   'Where we are, what we are doing, which way we go, and what we want – it's all been  determined by means of detection and acquisition magic. It is not too difficult for a master of  magic to locate a person from a distance and observe them – as long as that person was once  well known and close to them.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Cahir
"So:  That battle took place on the last day of August during the Great War. It was fought in  Angren, on the bridge connecting the two shores of the river Yaruga near a fortress called  the Red Binduga. The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army  Corps of Lyria – led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company – myself, the writer of  these lines, the Geralt Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the  archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian  who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a  Nilfgaardian. You, reader, might be unclear on how the Queen came be alive and in Angren, as you  may have heard that she disappeared and perished along with her army when the  Nilfgaardians thrust into Lyria, Rivia and Aedirn in July, which ended with the complete  subjugation of those countries and their occupation by Imperial troops. Meve was not,  however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Rather than quickly and anonymously vanishing from the scene, Geralt  rode around in the royal camp, delighting in the honour, enjoying the patronage and basking  in the glory. But fame and attention were the last things we needed. To those to who have forgotten, I  call to mind that the afore-mentioned Geralt Geralt, now knighted, was wanted in  connection to the uprising on Thanedd, the island of magicians, by the intelligence services of  all four kingdoms. To me, a person who has never been guilty of anything, they tried to attach  the charge of espionage. In addition was Milva who, as it turned out, had collaborated with  the Dryads and the Scioa'tael and had been involved in the infamous massacres of people on  the edges of Brokilon Forest.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Therefore, it was sufficient that only one of us needed to be exposed and identified in order to  bring sharpened aspen stakes on all of us. Every day we spent in the shadow of Lyrian flags –  which at first were spent comfortably, well fed and safe, by the way – increased the risk. When I strongly reminded Geralt of this, his face darkened a little, but he presented his  motives to me, of which he had two. First, Milva still needed nursing and care after her  unfortunate accident and there were field medics with the army. Second, Queen Meve's army    was travelling east, towards Caed Dhu.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Naive as a child, he rushed to Queen Meve to receive a  discharge from the army and the royal blessing for his private affairs. And at that moment the  royal grace and favour came to an end, and the respect and admiration for the heroes of the  Battle on the Bridge scattered like smoke. The knight Geralt of Riva was reminded in a cold,  but firm tone of his duties to the Crown. The still-ailing Milva, the vampire Regis and the  author of these lines were advised to join the column of refugees and civilians who followed  the camp. Cahir aep Ceallach, a tall young man who looked nothing like a civilian, had a  blue and white sash tied to him and was assigned to the so-called Free Company – a cavalry  unit comprised of all sorts of scum the Lyrian Corps had picked up along the way.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Yes, it was not even the  beginning! As soon as Milva learned of the development of things, she immediately declared  herself to be healthy and fit for travel – and issued the watchword to escape at the first  opportunity. Cahir threw the royal colours in the bushes and disappeared from the Free  Company, and advised Geralt to do the same from the exquisite luxury tents of the  knighthood. I will not indulge details about myself – my modesty does not allow me to highlight my  own achievements in the company's escape – though they were not small. I will only state the  facts: On the night between September fifth and sixth, our company quietly left the Corps of  Queen Meve.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"After all, we deserved a bonus for  our participation in the memorable Battle for the Bridge. And if not a reward, at least  satisfaction and compensation for the losses suffered. Apart from Milva's tragic accident and  the numerous injuries and wounds Geralt and Cahir had sustained, all of our horses had  been killed or maimed in the battle – excepting my trusty Pegasus and the wayward Roach,  the mare of the Geralt. So, as recompense, we took three thoroughbred horses and a pack  horse. We also provided ourselves with as much equipment as we could fit into our hands – in  fairness I should add that we threw half of it away later.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"I've always held this supposed evidence of high  intelligence is instead evidence of rudeness and arrogance, properties that fit well in the  university environment or circles at court, but are difficult to endure from a companion with  whom you spend the day riding stirrup to stirrup, and the nights sleeping in the same camp. Thanks to Milva, however, no one got seriously upset by this. In contrast to Geralt and Cahir,  who seemed to be prompted to adopt the style of the vampire and even to compete with him in  this regard, the archer Milva enacted a simple and unpretentious solution. The third time she  noticed him answer her in the middle of a question, she swore at him vigorously, using words  and descriptions that could even drive an old trooper to blush with shame. And, wonder of  wonders, it helped – the vampire laid aside the enervating style in a jiffy.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'Where the scribe is, is also the judge', he always    said, 'today they are writing to you, tomorrow they hang on you.' And he was right, although  he was a scumbag like no other. I hope that he's stewing in hell, the son of a bitch!'   Milva threw off the blanket and sat down by the fire, finally giving up on sleeping. It  looked, Geralt noticed, like it would once again be a long night of conversation. 'You did not like your stepfather, I take it,' said Dandelion after a short silence. 'I did not.' Milva audibly gritted her teeth.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Don't you even dare, do you hear me?'      ***      It was strange that Milva had joined us and astonishing that the vampire kept us  company. But the strangest – and absolutely incomprehensible – motives were from Cahir,  who suddenly went from an enemy to something like a friend, or at least an ally. The young  man had proved that in the Battle on the Bridge when chose, without hesitation, to side with  the Geralt against his own people. Through that act, he had finally won our favour and  dispelled our doubts. When I write 'our', I refer to myself, the vampire and the archer.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble. He  was as noble as the cormorant who does not gobble a caught fish because it's had a choker  placed around its neck, making it impossible for it to swallow. He took the fish in his beak,  but could not swallow because he had to bring it back to his master.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"In truth, no  one actually knows. But one thing is certain, if the Druids catch you, they bind you to a  willow trunk and roast you. To go to them is to go to certain death.'   'We do not fear them,' said Geralt calmly. 'Of course.' The bee keeper looked at the Geralt, Milva, and Cahir, who had just come  into the hut after feeding the horses. 'One can see that you're not timid people, you're  combative and fortified.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'The fact strikes me...' said Milva, who was the first to crawl out of the haystack after  being awakened by voices. 'The fact strikes me that I am always right. Look at this, Geralt.'   The clearing was filled with people. It obvious at first glance that five or six bee keepers  had gathered here. The experienced eye of the Geralt also spotted a few trappers and at least  one coal burner in the crowd.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Speak, lad. But  remember what you said, because you actually might end up in the ground!'   The bee keeper lowered his eyes and stared nervously at the ground under his feet. Geralt  eloquently remained silent. Milva, who had finally understood what the Geralt had implied,  cursed indecently. Cahir snorted disapprovingly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"When the bee keeper  learned that the Druids were nearby, he came running to tell. And now he was beaming with  the contentment, pride, and importance that any liar has when their lie proves to be true by  chance. Geralt had originally planned to strike out immediately for Loc Monduirn, but his  companions protested vigorously. Regis and Cahir argued that they should use the money  from the bee keeper to replenish their supplies and equipment in the city. Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks. Dandelion wanted to spend at least one night sleeping  in a bed in an inn, where he could bathe and enjoy a nice beer before bedtime. The Druids, everyone told Geralt, would not run away. 'Although it is pure coincidence,' said the vampire Regis with a strange smile, 'Our team  is definitely on the right track and absolutely headed in the right direction. Therefore, it is  apparent that we are inevitably destined to encounter the Druids.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Six days before the autumn equinox. ***      Milva, Regis, and Cahir were in charge of making purchases and replenishing their  equipment. Geralt and Dandelion, in contrast, went out to get more news from the residents  of Riedbrune. Riedbrune was situated in a bend of the Newi River. It was a small town if you only  counted the brick and wooden buildings that were within the ring of palisade-crowned  earthworks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"He listened attentively and did not interrupt. The Geralt was not mistaken in his perspicacity. 'We are five, not four,' he quickly summarized after Geralt had finished his story. 'We  have been five since the end of August, and five crossed the Yaruga. Milva only cut off her  braid in the river country.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'You can order me. You brought me  out of jail and tore me from the clutches of Lord Fulk. You are now the leader of my  Hanse...'   'Be quiet, please.'   Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back,  because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir,  who rode ahead them. They rode towards the mountains, along the banks of the Newi River,  whose waters were cloudy yellow-brown after the recent rains, and streaked across stones and  swells. They were not alone.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"We were  not taught to cripple our neighbours with iron. In addition... I'm also...' he advised the Geralt  and Milva with flashing eyes. 'I'm a coward,' he confessed shortly. 'If I do not have to, I do  not want to go through something like that time on the barge and the bridge again.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'I don't quite understand what's being  discussed, but it was well said.'    'I'm not your aunt!' Milva's eyes sparkled threateningly. 'Watch it, lady! Call me that  again and you'll see!'   'What will I see?'   'Silence!' barked the Geralt sharply. 'Enough, Angouleme! I see I need to call all of you  to order.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"And they destroy the rabble. Which is us. Geralt, you should make one change to your  plans.'   'What?'   'If anyone is going to ride Belhaven and to Nightingale, it should be me, you and Lord  Cahir. And Aunty should ride with the others.'   'Why?' Geralt calmed Milva with a gesture. 'Because we need guys for this.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"I know what I'm talking about! If we get that far, we might be able to intimidate them rather than using force. And no one in  Nightingale's Hanse would be afraid of three people when two of them are women.'   'Milva rides with us.' Geralt's fingers clasped the shoulder of the archer, who was  furious. 'Milva, not Cahir. I do not want to ride with Cahir.'   'And why not?' Asked Angouleme and Cahir almost simultaneously.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Milva had removed the wide leather belt from her hips and wrapped the buckle once  around her hand. She ran to the fighters and began to beat them with all her strength, sparing  neither her arm nor the belt. The belt whistled and clapped as it met with hands, shoulders,  back, or arms – sometime's Cahir's, sometimes Geralt's. When they parted, Milva jumped  back and forth between them like a grasshopper, still continuing to whip them, one no more  than the other. 'You stupid jerks!' She cried, and sent a blow crashing onto Geralt's back.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Some of the miners  looked at them and then quickly looked away; others remained frozen with their mouths  open. Anyone that was in their way quickly moved aside. Geralt could imagine why. His face  still shone and Cahir's was still covered in stains, bruises, scratches and scrapes – the scenic  remnants of the fight and the beating Milva had given them. So they looked like individuals  who enjoyed cutting each other in the face, and who would also not take long to polish the  face of a third person.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Suddenly without warning, the picture became clear and sharp. Too sharp. 'Dandelion,' shouted Geralt. 'Milva! Angouleme!'   'What?' Avallac'h became interested.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Geralt was able to repulse him. The agile bandit moved into a position to  launch a dangerous low cut, when suddenly his eyes shut, he sneezed loudly and mucus ran  from his nose, at the time dropping his guard. The Geralt quickly slashed him in the neck,  the blade going all the way to his spine. 'Whatever anyone says,' he said looking at the expiring bandit, 'that drugs use is  extremely dangerous.'   A bandit who was coming at him with a club raise over his head, tripped and fell with his  nose into the mud, an arrow protruding from his groin. 'I'm coming, Geralt!' Milva cried.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'I'm coming, Geralt!' Milva cried. 'I'm coming! Hold on!'   Geralt turned around, but there was no one to fight. Milva shot the last remaining bandit  in the area. The rest had fled into the woods, chased by the colourful knights.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Where is Dandelion and Angouleme?'   'In the cabin with the pilgrims... Oh, shit.'   From the fog emerged three riders on war steeds, their coats and banners fluttering in the  wind. Geralt was expecting their battle cry. But Milva grabbed him and dragged him under a  wagon. There was no joking with someone who rode up armed with a length of spear  fourteen feet long, giving them an effective range of ten feet in front of their horse's head.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"The treaties! Not a foot  on the ground of the Druids!'   'It is them who are not allowed, not permitted,' snorted Angouleme, taking the reins of  two of the bandits horses. 'Leave this empty chatter, Geralt. Come on. I still have some  outstanding accounts with Nightingale, and you, so I guess, would still like to have a chat  with a certain half-elf.'   'I'm going with you,' said Milva.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Let him rest in peace... However, if this is so, let us go to Beauclair swiftly, gentlemen! Geralt, Milva, Angouleme,  we will be at the castle!'      ***      The forded the river, spurring their horses into the woods, among the spreading oaks, the  ferns reached up to their stirrups. Milva effortlessly found the trail of the band of fugitives. They travelled as fast as possible – Geralt feared for the Druids.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Milva tightened the bow in silence. But did not shoot, she waited until the bandit the  villain was head right towards them, as if he could not see them. He crossed at full speed  between the Geralt's horse and Angouleme's. They saw his face, white as a sheet and distorted by fear, eyes bulging. 'What the hell?' repeated Angouleme.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"The bushes snapped and branch broke and creaked. 'What is that?' Milva wailed, standing in the stirrups. 'What is it, Geralt?'   Geralt stared, saw and took a deep breath. Angouleme saw it too. And paled.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Milva, Angouleme... Run...'   'We will not leave you here!'   The tree creature must have heard, because it happily stamped it roots and hurried  towards them. Angouleme, when she failed to lift the Geralt, cursed vulgarly. Milva with  shaking hands was trying to put an arrow on the bowstring, as if that could somehow help. 'Run!'   I was too late.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"'Damn it all, I pissed myself!'   Milva just grunted. Her head dropped to her chest. Geralt cursed outrageously. It was all  he could do. The tree creature, spurred by the Druidess, moved through the forest.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"They fell down, none of them able to stand on their own. Milva was  unconscious, blood running from her nose. Geralt got up with difficulty and knelt over her. The steel-haired flaminica stood next to him and cleared her throat. Her face was very  thing, even emaciated, arousing an unpleasant association with a skull covered with skin.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Milva
"Before anyone arrived to  investigate us, we were already on the left bank of the Yaruga, deep in the forests of Riverdell  – where there was only one highway, leading south. To us, neither the direction of the  highway nor the number of Nilfgaardians travelling on it was convenient. At the first camp in the woods of Riverdell, I also had a strange dream – unlike Geralt I  dreamed not of Ciri, but of the sorceress Yennefer. The dream was strange, worrisome –  Yennefer was dressed, as usual, in black and white and flew through the air over a dark,  small, mountain castle, while other sorceresses underneath her shook their fists at her and  shouted insults. Yennefer waved the long sleeves of her dress and flew away like a black  albatross, out into a boundless sea, opposite the rising sun.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Yennefer,' Crach said after a while. 'There are other messages that have come from the  continent. I understand that your Geralt, who stayed in Brokilon after the fight on Thanedd,  has set out from there to reach Nilfgaard and liberate Ciri.'   'I repeat, Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. And what my Geralt, as you call him, intends to do, I  do not know. But he...",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Can we talk freely?'   'Of course.'   'You're alone?'   'Yes.'   'You're lying.'   'Yennefer...'   'You are deceiving me, brat. I know your face; I know you too well. It's the same look  you had when you started sleeping with Geralt behind my back. Back then you put on the  same sheepish, innocent mask that I see on your face now. And it means the same thing now  that it meant back then!'    Triss was red.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer
"And what do you think of them? You were a mentor to the girl, almost – as you put  it – a big sister. And Geralt...'   'Do not attack Triss' relationships, Yennefer.' Philippa retaliated with her own fire in her  eyes. 'We will find and rescue the girl without your help. And if you succeed, that's fine, a  thousand thanks, because you will have saved us the trouble.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer
"And if you succeed, that's fine, a  thousand thanks, because you will have saved us the trouble. You tear the girl out of the  hands of Vilgefortz and we will be happy. And Geralt? Who cares about Geralt?'   'Did you hear that, Triss?'    'Forgive me,' said Triss Merigold dully. 'Forgive me, Yennefer.'   'Oh no, Triss.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer
"Damn it! I'm freezing out  here and Schirru is surely sitting in the warmth... When I think that I myself urged that I be sent after Ciri and Schirru be sent after the  Geralt...

"Hmmm... Who will take this job? The final solution to the Geralt  question?'      ***      It was assigned to Schirru, Rience recalled as he shifted himself in the stirrups to gain a  moments relief from his aching, saddle-sore buttocks. Schirru volunteered to kill the Geralt. He knew the area where Yennefer had detected Geralt and his company – he had friends or  relatives there.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Yennefer

"'Good evening, Viscount.'   Vattier flicked his forearm, shaking loose the stiletto hidden in his sleeve. The handle  slipped into his hands. 'You are risking a lot, Rience,' he said coldly. 'You're risking a lot to show your scorched  visage in Nilfgaard. Ahh, it must be a magical teleprojection...'   'You've noticed?",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"Vilgefortz guaranteed that no one will be able to guess that it is an  illusion without contact.'   Vattier put away the stiletto. He had guessed that it was an illusion, but now he knew it. 'Rience,' he said, 'you're too cowardly to show up here in person. You know what you  could expect.'   'The emperor is still prejudiced against me? And against my master Vilgefortz?'   'Your insolence is disarming.'   'Hell, Vattier.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"I  promise. But until then... Apage, Rience.'   'I don't know you any more, Vattier. The Vattier I knew, even if the devil had appeared  before him, wouldn't fail to find out if it could be beneficial to him, accidently or not, before  he performed the exorcism.'    Vattier did not acknowledge the illusion by looking at it, but instead watched the algae- covered carp lazily stir up the mud in the pond. 'Beneficial?' He finally repeated, and pursed his lips with contempt.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"'You've got it.'   'What I have got?'   'Cahir. We will procure the head of Cahir for you. Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier. 'Modify the sequence of names, but still...'   'As you wish. Vilgefortz – with my humble help – will procure for you the head of Cahir,  son of Ceallach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"We know where he is, we know where he wants to go know,  and we know in whose company he travels. You want his head? We can get it.'   'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened  on Thanedd.'   'That will probably be better,' replied Rience cynically. 'Why give Cahir the opportunity  to give speeches? Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor,  not to deepen it.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"But wise in regards to what? Always the same mud and same  water lilies. 'Your price Rience?'   'A trifle. Where is Stefan Skellen and what are his plans?'      ***      'I told him what he wanted to know.'

'You see, my sweet, certain things  have to be addressed wisely.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"Vattier must value him very much, because he was extremely angry  about his disappearance.'   I, too, thought Assire, am furious by the disappearance of Jediah Mekesser.

Both were silent a moment.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"I'll do it with inexpressible pleasure. And I'll treat it as an expression of historical  justice. I bet you do not understand.'    Rience remained silent, so Skellen continued. 'You know, Rience, I counselled Vattier de Rideaux to burn your heels even then, seven  years ago, when you crawled up to the imperial intelligence like a dog, begging for the  privilege to be a double agent.

"You see, in exchange for the thin  teenager, I'll grant you the fulfilment of the ambitions and desires of your life. Do you see?'   'No,' The Owl shook his head. 'I can only hear.'   'Rience.'   'Yes, master?'   'Give Mister Coroner a sample of our information. Tell him what you know of Vattier.'    'In your unit,' said Rience, 'there is a spy.'   'What?'   'You heard. Vattier de Rideaux has a mole here.",The Tower of the Swallow,Rience,Vattier
"As usual, hard to  grasp and understand. I am glad to see you in health, Yennefer. I am happy that your crazy  teleportation from Montecalvo did not end in tragedy.'

Philippa shrugged her shoulders.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Philippa
"I will not tell on you.'   Philippa stared at her from under lowered eyelids. 'If you believe,' she said finally, 'that  you've won peace, time, or security with this declaration, then you've miscalculated. Make no  mistake about it, Yennefer. When you fled from Montecalvo, you made your decision. You  chose to stand on a different side of the barricade.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Philippa
"You do not want to allow us to use Ciri for  our political purposes. You should know that we will also do everything in our power to  make sure that you cannot use the girl for your sentimental purposes.'   'So its war?'   'Competition.' Philippa smiled toxically. 'Competition only, Yennefer.'   'Decent and honourable?'   'You must be joking.'   'Obviously. Though on at least one specific issue, I would like have an honest and  genuine conversation. And incidentally it involves a favour to me.'   'Speak.'   'Over the next few days, maybe even tomorrow, events will occur whose consequences I  cannot foresee.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Philippa
"Because we are primarily  concerned for her health! For her life! Yennefer, Dijkstra has found some traces of... some  traces of certain activities have been found. If Vilgefortz does have Ciri, then the girl faces a  horrible death.'   'Be quiet, Triss,' Philippa Eilhart hissed sharply.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Philippa
"It is not in  the interest of the Lodge for him to furiously attempt to avenge you. If he despises you, he  will not attempt to take revenge.

"And what do you think of them? You were a mentor to the girl, almost – as you put  it – a big sister. And Geralt...'   'Do not attack Triss' relationships, Yennefer.'

And if you succeed, that's fine, a  thousand thanks, because you will have saved us the trouble.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Philippa
"The past is the past and was not written into the register. Good night.'      ***       'Well, well.' Crach an Craite glanced at his visitor, his head tilted to one side. 'Triss  Merigold in person. What an exceptionally pretty dress. And the lining...",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"I would ask, what leads you to the Skellige... If I did not already know. But I do  know.'   'Very good.' Triss smiled seductively, flipping her beautiful auburn hair. 'Very well, you  know, Earl. That saves us the introduction and the introductory statements, so we can  immediately get down to business.'   'For what purpose?' Crach folded his arms across his chest and measured the sorceress  with a cold stare.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"That saves us the introduction and the introductory statements, so we can  immediately get down to business.'   'For what purpose?' Crach folded his arms across his chest and measured the sorceress  with a cold stare. 'What statements do you reckon we should we start with? Who do you  represent, Triss? In whose name are you here? King Foltest granted you employment as a  reward for your services with a curse.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"She decided to promote the digestion with white wine, made with the famous  Toussaint Est Est. She drank from a horn with Crach. 'So Yennefer,' Triss continued the conversation, 'turned up here on the nineteenth day of  August by spectacularly falling from the sky fell into a fishing net. You, a loyal vassal of  Cintra, granted her asylum. You helped her build a megascope...",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"And the Radcliffe Commission?'   Crach an Craite looked at the sorceress suspiciously. 'Here on the island,' – he sounded  sour -'neither politics nor culture penetrate. We are isolated.'   Triss thought it appropriate to note neither his voice nor his face. 'The Radcliffe  Commission examined the tracks leading away from Thanedd teleportation portal. The  teleportation portal of Tor Lara, located on the island, was disabled as long as the magical  blocks of the Tower existed in any considerable degree.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"Even if it were in ruins, surrounded by bare stones, I'm sure you  could find and activate it. And it would, I'm sure, obey your command. Because Ciri, I think  you are the chosen one.'      ***      'Your hair, Triss, is like fire in the candlelight. And your eyes are like Lapis Lazuli. Your  lips are like coral...'   'Stop it, Crach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"Me neither. But I've already gone too far... Perhaps the lion should hear the  lamb's complaint...'      ***      'I was afraid of that,' whispered Triss. 'That's exactly what I was afraid of.'   'I mean, I understood it at that time.' Crach an Craite's jaw muscles began to tense. 'Yennefer knew that someone had eavesdropped on the conversations she had through her  infernal machine.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"I have one last telecommunication I need to  conduct.'      ***       Crach an Craite's eyes were like a hawk's. They drilled deep inside her... 'By chance, do you happen to know, Triss Merigold, who Yennefer conducted her last  call with before she took her infernal machine apart? On the night of the twenty-seventh to  the twenty-eighth of August? With whom?",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"And Geralt? Who cares about Geralt?'   'Did you hear that, Triss?'    'Forgive me,' said Triss Merigold dully. 'Forgive me, Yennefer.'   'Oh no, Triss. Never.'      ***      Triss stared at the ground. Crach an Craite's eyes were like a hawk's.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Crach
"Between her shamelessly spread legs knelt a lean, long-haired individual in a gray-brown  coat. That could be none other than Master Alma Vera, the tattoo artist, because he was just  about to bite a colourful picture into Mistle's leg. 'Come closer,' Giselher motioned for Hotsporn to take an empty stool at the table where  he sat with Spark, Kayleigh, and Reef. The latter two were dressed similarly to Asse in black  calf leather jackets, which were littered with buckles, rivets, chains and other fanciful  embellishments of silver. They must have originally belonged to some craftsman, thought  Hotsporn.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle
"'It is a bounty hunter,' explained Giselher gloomily. 'He started as a soldier, then became  a travelling trader, and has finally succumbed to killing people for reward. He is a son of a  bitch beyond compare.'   'He is' Kayleigh said, rather carelessly, 'if everyone Bonhart has killed were buried in the  same cemetery, it would be a half acre in size.'   Mistle sprinkled a little white powder in the hollow between her thumb and forefinger,  and snorted it violently up her nose. 'Bonhart destroyed the gang of the Big Lothar', she said. 'He stabbed him and his brother,  the one they called the Toadstool.'   'More like he stabbed them in the back,' accused Kayleigh.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle
"Officially, as a  community service. And grant you protection. Officially and alternatively.'   Kayleigh was about to speak, and Mistle also wanted to say something, but a quick glance  from Giselher shut their mouths tight. 'Submit to the guild...' said the leader of the Rats in an icy tone, 'We are grateful for the    offer. We will think it over – contemplate it and discuss it amongst ourselves.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle
"Just yesterday I was thinking  that I would like to kill you for fun and entertainment, but you came here yourselves and  saved me trouble, and that touches my heart. So I leave you the choice. How do you prefer I  take you – alive or dead?'   Kayleigh clenched his jaw and Mistle leaned forward, ready to pounce. Giselher grabbed her by the shoulder. 'He wants to make us angry,' he whispered.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle
"He came down from the porch  without haste, his spurs jingling. The Rats quickly spread across the width of the road. Kayleigh went furthest to the left,  almost to the wall of a distillery. Next to him was Spark, her thin lips curled into her usual,  terrible smile. Mistle, Asse and Reef went to the right.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle
"And die. Spark, taken in the neck, fell in the mud and curled up like a kitten, blood spurting from  her aorta to her calves and knees. The bounty hunter beat back Mistle's and Giselher's wide,  sweeping attacks, then he spun around and, with a lightning-quick strike from his sword tip,    slit Kayleigh open – from collarbone to hip. Kayleigh dropped his sword, but did not notice –  he just crouched and grabbed his chest and abdomen with both hands, blood gushing from  under his palms. Bonhart dodged Giselher's blow with another spin, parried Mistle's attack  and dealt another blow to Kayleigh, which turned one side of his head into scarlet pulp.",The Tower of the Swallow,Kayleigh,Mistle

"Ciri, the granddaughter of  Calanthe. The lion cub of Cintra. I, Yennefer of Vengerberg, care for Ciri as my daughter. That is why I am asking, on her behalf, that you keep your oath.

"'Yennefer,' Crach said after a while. 'There are other messages that have come from the  continent. I understand that your Geralt, who stayed in Brokilon after the fight on Thanedd,  has set out from there to reach Nilfgaard and liberate Ciri.'   'I repeat, Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. And what my Geralt, as you call him, intends to do, I  do not know. But he...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"Crach, it's no secret that he and I... that I am sympathetic to him. But I  know he will not save Ciri. He will achieve nothing. I know him.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"He'll vent his anger and hack at anyone and  anything he comes across. Then, in expiation, he'll do some grand, but pointless deed. In the  end, he'll be slain, stupidly and needlessly, most likely by a stab in the back.'   'It is said', Crach threw in quickly, frightened by the ominous changes and strange  trembling voice of the sorceress, 'that Ciri is his destiny. I've seen it myself, back in Cintra, at  Pavetta's betrothal...'   'Predestination,' Yennefer sharply interrupted him, 'can be interpreted in different ways. Very different ways.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"As the representative of Ciri, as her only guardian, you have a formal right to order  me and to demand obedience and service.'   'Casuistic quibble.'   'Sure.' He laughed. 'I myself will call it such loudly, if after all it turns out that Emhyr var  Emreis has forced the girl to marry him. Even if Ciri is ruled out by any legal manoeuvrings  of the throne and someone else takes her place, such as that idiot Vissegerd. Then I will  immediately renounce my oath of obedience and fealty.'   'What if' – Yennefer narrowed her eyes -'it turns out that despite everything Ciri is  dead?'   'She's alive,' said Crach firmly. 'I know she is safe.'   'How?'   'You would not believe me.'   'Try me.'   'The blood of the queens of Cintra,' began Crach in a thoughtful tone, 'is strangely  connected with the sea.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"Three  times. After the death of Adalia the Seer, after the death of Calanthe... And after the death  Pavetta, the mother of Ciri.'   'Pavetta' remarked Yennefer, 'was killed during a storm, so one can hardly say that...'   'Pavetta' interrupted Crach, still thoughtfully, 'was not killed during a storm. The assault  began after her death. The sea, as usual, responded to the death of someone of Cinterein  blood.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"What it does it matter now who serves whom, who is on whose  side, and who remained loyal to whom for what reasons? Yennefer is no longer alive. It is  still not known where Ciri is and in whose power... What is the sense of this secrecy? I did  not come as a spy, Crach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"I did  not come as a spy, Crach. I came out of my own accord, as a private person. Guided by  concern for Ciri.'   'Many are concerned for Ciri. The girl is very lucky.' Triss' eyes flashed. 'I would not  mock it.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"Even if it were in ruins, surrounded by bare stones, I'm sure you  could find and activate it. And it would, I'm sure, obey your command.

'Stop it, Crach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Crach
"So:  That battle took place on the last day of August during the Great War. It was fought in  Angren, on the bridge connecting the two shores of the river Yaruga near a fortress called  the Red Binduga. The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army  Corps of Lyria – led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company – myself, the writer of  these lines, the Geralt Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the  archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian  who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a  Nilfgaardian. You, reader, might be unclear on how the Queen came be alive and in Angren, as you  may have heard that she disappeared and perished along with her army when the  Nilfgaardians thrust into Lyria, Rivia and Aedirn in July, which ended with the complete  subjugation of those countries and their occupation by Imperial troops. Meve was not,  however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"However, it soon wore off  because we received no rewards, only thanks. The exception was the Geralt Geralt. Because, contrary to his often proclaimed – and, as you can see, hypocritical – indifferent  attitude and his often declared neutrality, the Geralt Geralt displayed equally large and  overly-spectacular zeal on the battlefield. In other words: He fought so remarkably well that  it was impossible not to notice. And indeed, it did not go unnoticed – Meve, the Queen of  Lyria, personally knighted him.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"And indeed, it did not go unnoticed – Meve, the Queen of  Lyria, personally knighted him. However, this accolade soon revealed more inconveniences  than advantages. You must know, dear reader, that the Geralt Geralt was always a modest,  uncomplicated, balanced, and controlled man, who kept his feelings to himself and was as  straightforward as a halberd shaft. However, the unexpected promotion and apparent favour  of Queen Meve changed him – had I not known him better, I would have said that the glory  had gone to his head. Rather than quickly and anonymously vanishing from the scene, Geralt  rode around in the royal camp, delighting in the honour, enjoying the patronage and basking  in the glory.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"Therefore, it was sufficient that only one of us needed to be exposed and identified in order to  bring sharpened aspen stakes on all of us. Every day we spent in the shadow of Lyrian flags –  which at first were spent comfortably, well fed and safe, by the way – increased the risk. When I strongly reminded Geralt of this, his face darkened a little, but he presented his  motives to me, of which he had two. First, Milva still needed nursing and care after her  unfortunate accident and there were field medics with the army. Second, Queen Meve's army    was travelling east, towards Caed Dhu.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"Rampant horsemen and marauding  mercenaries in Angren had been the reason we were forced to stray from the straight path to  the Druids. Now, under the protection of friendly Lyrian army, and with the favour and  affection of Queen Meve, we could openly travel the way to Caed Dhu, easily and safely. I warned the Geralt that the Queen's apparent favour was fickle and deceptive. The  Geralt would not listen. However, it was soon shown who was right.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"However, it was soon shown who was right. When news arrived  from the east that a Nilfgaardian punitive expedition was marching to Angren from Klamat  pass, the Lyrian army turned north without hesitation, towards Mahakam. As one can easily  imagine, Geralt did not like this change of direction – he wanted to reach the Druids as  quickly as possible, not Mahakam! Naive as a child, he rushed to Queen Meve to receive a  discharge from the army and the royal blessing for his private affairs. And at that moment the  royal grace and favour came to an end, and the respect and admiration for the heroes of the  Battle on the Bridge scattered like smoke.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"Yes, it was not even the  beginning! As soon as Milva learned of the development of things, she immediately declared  herself to be healthy and fit for travel – and issued the watchword to escape at the first  opportunity. Cahir threw the royal colours in the bushes and disappeared from the Free  Company, and advised Geralt to do the same from the exquisite luxury tents of the  knighthood. I will not indulge details about myself – my modesty does not allow me to highlight my  own achievements in the company's escape – though they were not small. I will only state the  facts: On the night between September fifth and sixth, our company quietly left the Corps of  Queen Meve.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"'It is not Dijkstra. Nor Vissegerd. Nor Meve.'   'Who then?'   'Any judgment, any conclusion would be premature.'   True,' said the Geralt coldly. 'That case must be examined on the spot. And the  conclusions can be drawn from the autopsy.'   'But I,' insisted Dandelion, 'still consider this idea to be stupid and risky.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Meve
"She tried with all her might. ***      The next day Vysogota pulled out half the stitches. Ciri rubbed her cheek, hissing like a  snake, complaining of severe pain in her ear and hypersensitivity in her neck under her jaw. Still, she got up, dressed and went outside. Vysogota did not protest, but accompanied her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Even a hermit has to make a  living.'   'Where is my horse?'   'In the pen. '   The black mare greeted them with a loud snort and Vysogota's goat echoed with a bleat,  which echoed his great displeasure of having to share his accommodation with another  tenant. Ciri embraced the horse's neck and patted him, stroking his mane. 'Where is my saddle and saddle bags?'   'Here.'   He did not protest, make any comment or express any opinion. He was silent, leaning on  his cane.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"She massaged her face with her hands while sitting on the straw beside the saddle. 'As far away as possible.'   Vysogota nodded, as if the answer satisfied him, clarified everything and left no doubt. Ciri rose with effort. She did not even attempt to pick up the saddle and harness. She check to  see if the mare had hay and oats in the pen then began to rub his back and sides with straw.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"I'm just...'   'Just dizzy, because you are sick and weak as a newborn. Let's go back. You have to lie  down.'      ***       About sunset, having previously slept for a few hours, Ciri came outside again. Vysogota,  who had just returned from the river, met her at the hedge of hazel bushes. 'Do not go far from the hut,' he warned.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Vysogota looked on  calmly. 'I do not know,' he replied calmly. 'But I used to be a doctor, Ciri. It has been a long  time, but I can still distinguish a wound inflicted in a few hours to a wound that has been  untreated for four days. I found you on September twenty seventh, thus you were wounded  on the twenty sixth.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Not at all.'      ***       Three days later, Vysogota took out the last of the stitches. He had every reason to be  please and proud of his work – the stitching was straight and clean, there was no fear of dirt  being tucked in the wound. The surgeon's satisfaction was only marred by watching Ciri star  at the scar in gloomy silence, trying different angles with a mirror and trying to hide it,  without success, by throwing her hair over her cheek. The scar had disfigured here. A fact is a  fact.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"It was possible that the condition  might show a slow or rapid improvement. However, Vysogota knew there was no possibility  that the scar would disappear or cease to disfigure her. Ciri was feeling much better, to Vysogota's amazement and satisfaction and no longer  spoke of leaving. He took the black mare, Kelpie from his the pen. Vysogota knew that in the  north, Kelpie was a sea monster that could according to superstition take the form of horse, a  dolphin or even a beautiful woman, but in its real form it looked a lot like sea weed.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"It is a sign that the books were made at the University of Oxenfurt.'   She paused, still staring intently. Vysogota was silent; he struggle to make sure his face  did not betray anything. 'So I think,' Ciri said, throwing back her head in a move that was characteristic of her,  proud and somewhat violent, 'that you are not a simpleton or a hermit. That you did not leave  voluntarily from the world, but you ran away from it. And you hide here in the wilds, masked  between the impassable swamps.'   'If so,' Vysogota smiled, 'then our luck has joined in a very strange way, my well-read  maiden.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"And you hide here in the wilds, masked  between the impassable swamps.'   'If so,' Vysogota smiled, 'then our luck has joined in a very strange way, my well-read  maiden. Destiny has put us together in mysterious ways. At the end of the day, you too, Ciri,  are hiding. At the end of the day, you too, Ciri, deftly weave around you a veil of  appearances. I'm old and full of suspicions and mistrust, embittered by age...'   'Towards me?'   'Towards the world, Ciri.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Falka began to giggle and undress without ceremony. 'I want a rose,' she said. 'In the very same place as yours, darling.'      ***      'I think you might have mice, Vysogota.' Ciri interrupted her story and looked at the  floor, where the light from the small lamp illuminated a true tournament of mice. One could  only imagine what was going on outside the glow of the lamp, in the dark. 'You could use a cat.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"She didn't even try to hold me back... dawn was approaching already...'   'Dawn also approaches now.' Vysogota yawned. 'Time to sleep, Ciri. Tell me more  tomorrow.'   'Maybe you're right.' She also yawned, got up, and stretched herself vigorously. 'I can  barely keep my eyes open.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"A clean bed! Do you understand  Vysogota?'   'Yes.'   'All of the sudden, I was ready to ride to the next province, to the next fort, to those black  Nilfgaardians I feared and hated so much... I was willing to say, 'Hey Nilfgaardian idiots, I'm  Ciri, I have not been taken by your stupid emperor for his wife, they have planted some  brazen impostor with your emperor, and the idiot did not even notice the scam!' I was so keen    that I would have done it, if an opportunity presented itself. Without hesitation. Do you  understand Vysogota?'   'Yes.'   'Fortunately, I calmed down.'   'To your good fortune.' He nodded seriously.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"They had a lot of work to do. 'Did you catch up to Hotsporn?' Vysogota finally asked. 'Yes.' Ciri wiped her forehead with her sleeve. 'And I caught up with him quickly,  because he was in no hurry. And he wasn't even surprised when he saw me!'      ***      'Miss Falka!' Hotsporn pulled his reins and his black mare turned and pranced.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"So I had to watch what he was doing. He must make sure that the goods didn't  go bad, he said. That they did not decompose...'   Ciri's voice cracked, her words stuck in her dry throat. Vysogota, who knew at once what  he was about to hear, felt the bile rising in his throat like a flood. 'He cut their heads off,' Ciri said flatly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"I was not there at  all... Do you understand?'   'I understand.' Vysogota nodded. 'I understand, Ciri.'      ***      'This time, High Tribunal, it was our turn. Our group. Neratin Ceka received our  command and Boreas Mun was assigned our tracker.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"It would have been laughable if... if he had not been so terrible.'   Vysogota silently closed his eyes, which were watering from the wind. They stood on a  hill that towered above the marshes of Pereplut, near the spot where the old man had found  Ciri two weeks ago. The wind bent the reeds and made the water ripple on the flood plains of  the river. 'One of the four,' continued Ciri, while they allowed the mare to go to the water and  drink, 'had a small crossbow on his saddle, and his hand crept towards it a bit.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Instinctively. To kill yourself takes character, strength, determination, and courage. But that they could not  teach you.'      ***      'As you see, he was right,' admitted Ciri with difficulty. 'I have not managed to.'   Vysogota was silent. He held a muskrat pelt.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"And like ashes. Somewhere on the bank a beaver's tail hit the water, so that they both jumped. Ciri was  sure that Vysogota had dozed off and that the beaver had woken him.

But now it's high time to haul in the trap. There are bound to be eels in  it. Ready?'   'Ready.' Ciri spat on her hands and grabbed the boat hook. Vysogota reeled in the  vanishing line from the water. 'Out with it.,The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"When they had finished working, Vysogota  pulled out two or three of the fattest eels from the basket, cut them into pieces, rolled them in  flour, and fried them in a huge pan. Then they ate and talked. 'You know, Ciri, something still keeps me awake at night. I have not forgotten what we  disagreed about, just after your recovery. About the date and the wound on your cheek that  made the most accurate calendar imaginable.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Where have they been, in your opinion?'   'I do not know.'   'Wonderful, so...'   The cat interrupted her sentence by pouncing on a thin, squeaking mouse. The cat  casually bit its throat, tore out its entrails, and then began to eat with an appetite. Ciri looked  on indifferently. 'The portal at the Tower of Gulls,' resumed Vysogota 'leads to the Tower of the Swallow. The Tower of the Swallow, but...'   The cat had eaten the mouse, leaving only the tail for dessert.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"There is only one small problem. I have no idea where this  Tower of the Swallow is.'   'I, however, may be able to improve that situation. Ciri, do you know what earns a man  his college degree?'

This man who  hangs from a tree?'   'That?' Vysogota looked at the loose page. 'A scene from the legend of Hemdall. The  hero Hemdall hung for nine days and nine nights on the world-ash tree to gain knowledge and  power through sacrifice and pain.'   Ciri rubbed her forehead. 'I have dreamed such a thing a few times before. A man  hanging from a tree...'   'The engraving has...,The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota
"Second, in the trunks he had quite a bit of his daughters stuff and she needed warmer clothes. Several changes of clothes, because it had been cold and damp for days and the washed  clothes hadn't dried. Ciri chose, tried on, rejected and took off. Vysogota sat at the table. He ate two boiled  potatoes and chicken wings.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Vysogota

"After all, she is of the elder blood... Nevertheless, my Super-Orter should have  discovered her. But it could not.'   Yennefer was quite enmeshed in a web of silver and copper wires, surrounded by a  scaffolding of tubes made of silver and porcelain. Tripods mounted on the chair held glass  vials that fluctuated with colourless liquids. 'I've therefore concluded' – Vilgefortz pushed another tube into her nose, this time it was  made of glass – 'that the only way to locate Ciri is an empathic probe.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Well, Yennefer. Here on this screen, I want to see Ciri. Where  she is, whom she is with and what she is doing, along with where and with whom she is  sleeping.'   Yennefer screamed piercingly, wildly, desperately. 'It hurts,' Vilgefortz fixed both his living eye the dead crystal eye on her. 'Certainly, it  hurts.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
I give you my word: I will only take from Ciri  what I need. And then I'll give you both your freedom. I swear it.'   Yennefer gritted her teeth even more. A trail of blood flowed over her chin. Vilgefortz abruptly stood up and waved his hand.,The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"The final solution to the Geralt  question?'      ***      It was assigned to Schirru, Rience recalled as he shifted himself in the stirrups to gain a  moments relief from his aching, saddle-sore buttocks. Schirru volunteered to kill the Geralt. He knew the area where Yennefer had detected Geralt and his company – he had friends or  relatives there. I, however, Vilgefortz sent to the negotiation with Vattier de Rideaux, and  then to track down Skellen and Bonhart... And I was a fool then, happy because I was sure I had fallen to the far easier and more  enjoyable task.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"It was possible that the condition  might show a slow or rapid improvement. However, Vysogota knew there was no possibility  that the scar would disappear or cease to disfigure her. Ciri was feeling much better, to Vysogota's amazement and satisfaction and no longer  spoke of leaving. He took the black mare, Kelpie from his the pen. Vysogota knew that in the  north, Kelpie was a sea monster that could according to superstition take the form of horse, a  dolphin or even a beautiful woman, but in its real form it looked a lot like sea weed.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"What did it matter that mine had died before he could be my lover?'      ***      The mare stamped her front feet on the ground, whinnied, and turned to one side, as if she  wanted to be admired. Ciri could not suppress a sigh of admiration when she saw her neck,    straight and slim but very muscular, the small, well-shaped forehead, the high withers, and  the admirably well-proportioned physique. Ciri approached the mare cautiously and showed her the bracelet on her wrist. The mare  snorted and pricked her ears up, but allowed Ciri to take the bridle and stroke her velvety  nose. 'Kelpie' said Ciri.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"So you shall be called Kelpie. And I couldn't care less whether it is over the top  or not.'   The mare snorted, pricked her ears up, and flicked her silky tail, which reached to her  ankles. Ciri, who was used to riding in a high saddle, shortened the stirrup straps and stroked  the unusually shallow, wooden framed saddle with no saddle horn. She put a boot in the  stirrup, and grasped the horse by the mane. 'Calm down, Kelpie.'   Contrary to appearances, the saddle was quite comfortable.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"'Calm down, Kelpie.'   Contrary to appearances, the saddle was quite comfortable. And for obvious reasons,  much lighter than the usual cavalry saddles. 'Now,' said Ciri as she patted the mare's warm neck, 'we'll see if you're fiery as well. Whether you're a real thoroughbred or just a mix-breed. What do you think of a gallop of  twenty miles, Kelpie?'      ***      If someone managed to sneak through the night and find the deeply hidden hut with a  moss thatched roof amidst the swamps, and if they peeked through the cracks in the shutters,  they would have seen a gray-bearded old man listening to the story of a teenage girl with  green eyes and ash-blond hair.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Many  different lengths of measurement were used then, but if we use the most common, we can  deduce that sixteen of their leagues is about fifty of our miles. We are in Pereplut, about three  hundred and fifty miles to the south of Assengard. In other words Ciri, you are only separated  from the Tower of the Swallow by three hundred miles, give or take. On your Kelpie it would  likely only take you six weeks to get there. In the spring, of course.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"According to the Elvish  calendar within three days will be a new year. According to the calendar of humans we will  have to wait two more moths for the New Year. Kelpie, the black mare of Ciri's, was kicking and snorting in the goat pen. When he entered the cottage, he found Ciri searching the trunks. He let her do it, even  encouraged her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"He went back quickly into the hut, muttering and  mumbling under his breath so as not to hear, because it should not be heard. Before he could relight the lantern, Kelpie emerged from the fog. 'Let's go into the hut,' Ciri said softly. 'And do not go out. Tonight will be an awful  night.'       ***      During dinner they quarrelled again.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Goodbye, Geraltess'   'Goodbye, hermit. Thank you for everything.'   She was sitting in her saddle and about to spur Kelpie, when he came over and grabbed  her hand. 'Ciri. Stay. Wait for winter to pass...'   'I'll get to the lake before the frost.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Bonhart swore, tugged at the reins, and drove his horse onto the ice. ***      'Run, Kelpie!'   Under the hooves of the black mare splashed the frozen ground. Ciri pressed against the horse's neck. The sight of Bonhart's pursuit filled her with dread. She feared this man.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"An infinite number of heavy doors opened silently in front of her. Kelpie's hooves rattled on the ground. The geometry of the surrounding walls, arches, and columns was suddenly disturbed, so  violently that Ciri thought it must not be real. It seemed to her that she was travelling through  the interior of some impossible polyhedral body, a sort of giant octahedron. The doors continued to open.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Joined, rising  together. Contributing to each other's pleasure. Ciri gained control of her adrenaline compressed throat and promoted Kelpie. The hooves  clattered. The darkness vibrates with whispers.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Standing on the shore of the lake, with their front feet in the water, were two snow-white  horses. Kelpie snorted and struck her hoof on the rocks. As the horses lifted their heads and  the water dripped from their nostrils, and Ciri sighed loudly. Because they were not horses, but unicorns. Ciri was not surprised.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"The melody could be heard more clearly now, it came from behind the cherry bushes  clustered with white flower. Kelpie went in that direction by herself, without any invitation. Ciri swallowed then followed. Both unicorns, motionless as statues, stared at her. They  reflected on the smooth water surface.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"Behind the cherry bushes, a light-haired elf with a triangular face and huge, almond- shaped eyes sat on a round stone. He was playing, his fingers danced over the holes of the  flute. Although he noticed Ciri and Kelpie, although he looked at them, he did not stop  playing. The small, fragrant white flowers and the black cherries had an intense smell such as Ciri  had never experienced in her life. No wonder, she thought soberly: In the world where I've  lived, the cherries just smell different.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Kelpie
"He was a minnow, just like us. Does anyone ever notice  minnows in a time of war, when iron shapes both the world and the destinies of men? I'll bet my head that no one in Nilfgaard even remembers Cahir anymore. ***      Vattier de Rideaux, the chief of military intelligence for Nilfgaard, listened to the  imperial reprimand with his head bowed. 'So that's it,' continued Emhyr var Emreis acidly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"You can trust me on that!'   'Your Imperial Majesty' – Vattier de Rideaux cleared his throat – 'will no doubt make  the right decision after careful consideration of all the pros and cons. Both the failures and the  successes that have been reported. Your Majesty can be sure that the traitor Cahir aep  Ceallach will not escape his punishment. I've made an effort...'   'I do not pay you for efforts but for results. And they are moderate, Vattier, moderate!",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"Now move your ass. Find me Ciri. Find Cahir. And  Vilgefortz. Because I'm sure wherever Vilgefortz is, Ciri is near.'   'Your Imperial Majesty...'   'I'm listening Vattier!",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"Maybe your boss, Vilgefortz? Perhaps Cahir aep  Ceallach?'   'Halt!' The illusion of Rience raised his illusory hand. 'You've got it.'   'What I have got?'   'Cahir. We will procure the head of Cahir for you. Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier. 'Modify the sequence of names, but still...'   'As you wish. Vilgefortz – with my humble help – will procure for you the head of Cahir,  son of Ceallach. We know where he is, we can always pull him out of our sleeve, if desired.'   'You have opportunities perhaps. Please, are you telling me you have such good agents in  the army of Queen Meve?'   'You wish to test me?' Rience grimaced.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"You want his head? We can get it.'   'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened  on Thanedd.'   'That will probably be better,' replied Rience cynically. 'Why give Cahir the opportunity  to give speeches? Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor,  not to deepen it. I will procure the silent head of Cahir aep Ceallach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"He did not know that, despite appearances, Carthia van Canten possessed an excellent  memory and an intelligence like quicksilver. Everything Vattier told her, every scrap of information, every word that he had uttered to  her during their meeting – Carthia repeated the following morning to the sorceress Assir var  Anahid. ***      Yes, I'll bet my head that no one in Nilfgaard even remembered Cahir, not even his  fiancé, if he had one. But more about that later, first we will return to the day and place that we crossed the  Yaruga. We rode in somewhat of a rush to the east, towards the Black Forest, known as Caed  Dhu in the Elder Speech.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Vattier
"My name is Creavan Espane aep Caomhan  Macha. For convenience I use the alias Avallac'h. You can address me so.'   'As you please.'   'And you are Geralt of Rivia. You're a Geralt. However, you do not currently chase  monsters and beasts, you are looking for missing girls.'   'The news spreads amazingly fast.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"And  everybody does, because it is easy. The hard part is predicting it accurately.'   'An elegant argument and worthy of an epigram. You, clearly, can predict it accurately.'   'All too often, my dear Geralt, I know many things and I do many things. Evidence of this  is suggested by my – how you would say, people. My official title is 'Aen Saevherne'.'   'Knowing one.'   'Exactly.'   'And you would be willing to share your knowledge?'   Avallac'h paused.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"I've concluded that I do have  something to tell you. And to show you.'   On the other side of the wall was darkness. The Geralt immediately knew that the cavern  was immense – from the temperature and air movement. They walked on wet pebbles. Avallac'h conjured a light – the Elvish way, with only a gesture and without uttering a  spell.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Avallac'h conjured a light – the Elvish way, with only a gesture and without uttering a  spell. The glowing ball flew towards the ceiling, the crystal formations in the walls of the  cave were lit with a myriad of reflections and shadows danced. The Geralt sighed  involuntary. This was not the first time that he had seen Elvish sculptures and relief, but every time,  the feeling was the same. The figures of elves frozen in full motion in a blink of an eye, was  not the product of chisel and sculptor but a powerful wizard's spell that could transform  living tissue into white marble from the Amell Mountains.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"The milk-gloss of the polished marble gave the feeling that her beautiful  body was warm and radiated heat. Avallac'h stopped and leaned on one of the columns that defined the path between the  sculptures. 'For the second time,' he said quietly, 'you have found me out, Geralt. You were right,  the buffalo is painted on the wall as camouflage, which is there to prevent people digging  through the rock and protecting all that is hidden behind it. It was supposed to prevent the  devastation and theft.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Even death cannot separate them. Neither death nor oblivion... Or hatred.'   It seemed to the Geralt that the elf's indifferent voice had changed for a moment. But it  was unlikely that this was possible. Avallac'h approached the statue, with care and with a  delicate movement stroked the marble arm.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Avallac'h approached the statue, with care and with a  delicate movement stroked the marble arm. Then her turned and his triangular face showed  its trademark mocking smile. 'Do you know, Geralt, what the biggest drawback of longevity is?'   'No.'   'Sex.'   'What?'   'You heard right, sex. After less than one hundred years it eventually becomes boring. There is nothing in it that excites or fascinates, which would have the beauty of novelty.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Dying? Why  not, provided that before you do, you fuck. That, in short, is your entire philosophy.'   Geralt did not interrupt or say anything, but he really wanted to do so. 'And then what happens?' continued Avallac'h. 'The elves, bored with their boring elven  women, start to prefer willing human women, and the bored female elf indulged in the  perverse curiosity, of the human male who is always full of vigour and strength.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Well at least we thought so. No one suspected that a mongrel born of Cregennan  could inherit something positive from their mother. No, a marriage so unequal could not  bring anything good...'   'And so,' interrupted Geralt, 'were severely punished.'   'Not the way you think,' Avallac'h said quickly. 'Although the relationship between Lara  Dorren and Cregennan brought incalculable damage to the elves, it was humans, not elves  who murdered Cregennan. It was humans, not elves that led to the downfall of Lara.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"It was humans, not elves that led to the downfall of Lara. So it  was, although many elves had reason to hate the lovers. They also had personal reasons.'   For the second time, Geralt was surprised by the slight change in the tone of voice of the  elf. 'Anyways,' continued Avallac'h, 'the dream of coexistence burst like a soap bubble, and  between the races was sparked a bloody war, a war that continues to this day. Meanwhile,  the genetic material of Lara...",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Nevertheless, thank you, Avallac'h'   'In a way,' the elf shrugged, 'I am interest to see what a small stone can do if it falls  between the mill stone... Is there anything else I can do for you?'   'I think not. Because I guess you can't show me where Ciri is, right?'   'Who said that?'   Geralt held his breath. Avallac'h walked briskly to the cave wall and motioned the  Geralt to follow him. 'The walls of Tir na Bea Arainne,' he said pointing to the glowing crystal, 'have unusual  properties.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Suddenly without warning, the picture became clear and sharp. Too sharp. 'Dandelion,' shouted Geralt. 'Milva! Angouleme!'   'What?' Avallac'h became interested.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Angouleme!'   'What?' Avallac'h became interested. 'Ah, yes. It seems to me that you've destroyed  everything.'   Geralt jumped back from the wall of the cave, nearly falling on the basalt floor. 'It doesn't matter, dammit!' he said. 'Listen, Avallac'h, I have to quickly get to the Druid  forest.'   'Caed Myrkvid?'   'Yes!",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"Eeech, I would go with you... I feel the  desire for a proper fight. That would be a fine parade, running to the attack with a Geralt on  my back! But Avallac'h forbade me to show myself. For the safety of our entire  community...'   'I know.'   'Do not resent me because I hit you in the jaw.'   'I don't'   'You're a real man.'   'Thank you.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Avallac'h
"'The old gray bastard. We must have really stepped  on someone's toes.'   'Someone rich,' confirmed Mistle. 'Not many could afford Bonhart.'   Ciri was about to ask what this Bonhart was, but before she had the chance the same  question was spoken simultaneously by Reef and Asse. 'It is a bounty hunter,' explained Giselher gloomily. 'He started as a soldier, then became  a travelling trader, and has finally succumbed to killing people for reward.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"'He does not say,  because he knows who the Rats are. His guild knows it.'   Master Alma Vera had finished the tattoo. Ciri thanked him with a regal expression,  dressed, and sat down with the others. She hissed as she noticed Hotsporn's strange,  appraising – and somewhat mocking – stare. She looked at him askance and snuggled  ostentatiously close to Mistle's shoulder.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"She had already had practice cooling men's zeal and  attentions after such romantic demonstrations. However, in the case of Hotsporn it was rather  unnecessary, since the pseudo-merchant was not blatant in this regard. Hotsporn was a mystery to Ciri. She had only seen him once before, the rest had been told  to her by Mistle. Giselher said Hotsporn and he had known each other for a long time and  were buddies.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"And now suddenly she had to fulfil  orders, as a mercenary captor is told by his superiors who they should beat. Not only did they  carry out orders, but they obeyed with big ears. One hand washes the other, Mistle had said with a shrug when Ciri asked her about it. Hotsporn gives us commands, but he also gives information, thanks to which we survive. Freedom and contempt have their limits.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"But since Ciri has suddenly  been found, the story of her death must have only been a fabrication.'   'All stories are,' snorted Spark, leaning on Giselher's shoulder. 'Indeed' Hotsporn nodded 'one must admit it's a little bit like a fairy tale. It is said that an  evil sorceress held this Ciri captive in a magical tower somewhere far in the north. But she    – Ciri, not the witch – was able to flee and seek asylum in the empire.'   'That is one big, bloody, clusterfuck of lies and nonsense!' Ciri burst out and reached for  the jar of Fisstech with trembling hands. 'That may be,' Hotsporn continued slowly, 'But Emperor Emhyr proclaimed that he fell  helplessly in love with her at first sight and he now wants to take her to be his wife.'   'The little Falcon is right,' said Mistle decisively, emphasizing her words by banging her  fist on the table.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"'Look to Mistle and Falka for an example. They've already been  bed for an hour.'   The wife of the postmaster winced at the cooking pot when she heard the low, vicious,  disgusting giggles coming from the table. ***      Ciri raised her head and remained silent a long time, gazing at the barely glowing flames  of the lamp, in which the last of the remaining oil burned. 'Then I crept like a thief out of the station', she resumed her narrative. 'Before morning,  when it was still dark...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"You will  convince yourself how much I am able. How much I am able to change.'   'That would require a lot of power,' sighed Mistle. 'And mighty magic...'   'That's possible.' Ciri licked her lips. 'Even magic... with which I can find...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"You came into the Rats' gang by chance. It's not  your fault that one of the female bandits, Mistle, had an eye for you, her unnatural tendencies  are well known. You have been subjugated by Mistle, sexually exploited and forced to...'   'Well, there I'm going to have to interrupt you, yes,' Ciri was surprised by her calm  voice. 'Finally we have it, the truth about you, Hotsporn. I've experienced people like you  before.'   'Really?'   'Like every cockerel' – she was still speaking calmly – 'Your crest swells at the thought  of Mistle and me.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"Bonhart stepped  vigorously on her and pushed her into the dirt. But Mistle, who was holding her ripped open  stomach, got back up. 'Noooo' yelled Ciri. 'Miiistle!'    The bounty hunter heeded her cry without even turning his head. He swung wide and  struck with a powerful, sweeping blow, as with a scythe, so that Mistle was pulled up from  the ground and thrown against the wall, like a soft cloth doll, like a red smeared rag.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"Look, there's guts. This is blood. And that's  shit, which she used to have inside of her.'    Ciri squirmed and writhed, but his hand held her in place and before long her only  movements were twitching and dry retching. Mistle was still alive, but her eyes were dull and  glassy, like a fish. Her hand – like a hawk's talon – opened and closed, buried in mud and  faeces.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"'This little Rat is dying. In her own piss!'   He let go of her hair. Ciri slumped down to her hands and feet, shaking with sobs. Mistle  was right beside her. Mistle's hand, the slender, delicate, soft, clever hands of Mistle...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"You could tell that they had travelled a long way through the wild – bedrolls, dishes,  and horses were stained with dried mud and dust. There were four of them, but they also led a packhorse. When Ciri saw this packhorse she  suddenly became very hot, although the day was very cold. It was her white mare, still  wearing her bridle and saddle. And her headband, a gift from Mistle.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Mistle
"So:  That battle took place on the last day of August during the Great War. It was fought in  Angren, on the bridge connecting the two shores of the river Yaruga near a fortress called  the Red Binduga. The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army  Corps of Lyria – led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company – myself, the writer of  these lines, the Geralt Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the  archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian  who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a  Nilfgaardian. You, reader, might be unclear on how the Queen came be alive and in Angren, as you  may have heard that she disappeared and perished along with her army when the  Nilfgaardians thrust into Lyria, Rivia and Aedirn in July, which ended with the complete  subjugation of those countries and their occupation by Imperial troops. Meve was not,  however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Naive as a child, he rushed to Queen Meve to receive a  discharge from the army and the royal blessing for his private affairs. And at that moment the  royal grace and favour came to an end, and the respect and admiration for the heroes of the  Battle on the Bridge scattered like smoke. The knight Geralt of Riva was reminded in a cold,  but firm tone of his duties to the Crown. The still-ailing Milva, the vampire Regis and the  author of these lines were advised to join the column of refugees and civilians who followed  the camp. Cahir aep Ceallach, a tall young man who looked nothing like a civilian, had a  blue and white sash tied to him and was assigned to the so-called Free Company – a cavalry  unit comprised of all sorts of scum the Lyrian Corps had picked up along the way.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Yes, it was not even the  beginning! As soon as Milva learned of the development of things, she immediately declared  herself to be healthy and fit for travel – and issued the watchword to escape at the first  opportunity. Cahir threw the royal colours in the bushes and disappeared from the Free  Company, and advised Geralt to do the same from the exquisite luxury tents of the  knighthood. I will not indulge details about myself – my modesty does not allow me to highlight my  own achievements in the company's escape – though they were not small. I will only state the  facts: On the night between September fifth and sixth, our company quietly left the Corps of  Queen Meve.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"After all, we deserved a bonus for  our participation in the memorable Battle for the Bridge. And if not a reward, at least  satisfaction and compensation for the losses suffered. Apart from Milva's tragic accident and  the numerous injuries and wounds Geralt and Cahir had sustained, all of our horses had  been killed or maimed in the battle – excepting my trusty Pegasus and the wayward Roach,  the mare of the Geralt. So, as recompense, we took three thoroughbred horses and a pack  horse. We also provided ourselves with as much equipment as we could fit into our hands – in  fairness I should add that we threw half of it away later.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"The name obviously amused Regis, and must surely  have had some humorous meaning in the culture and language of vampires, but when we  wanted him to explain it to us, he claimed that it was an untranslatable play on words. So our company was on the road again, and the already lengthy list of people who had  something against us had become even longer. Geralt of Rivia, the knight without fear and  without reproach, left the ranks of knighthood before his accolade was notarized and before  the heraldic coat of arms he had devised was patented. Cahir aep Ceallach – who had  already fought with, and deserted, armies on both sides of the Great War between the  Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaard – had earned himself death sentences in absentia from  both. The rest of us were in no better positions – the noose is the noose, and it is ultimately  not a big difference, the only difference is for what – for defilement of chivalry, desertion, or  that you have given a military-mule the name of Draakula.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"I've always held this supposed evidence of high  intelligence is instead evidence of rudeness and arrogance, properties that fit well in the  university environment or circles at court, but are difficult to endure from a companion with  whom you spend the day riding stirrup to stirrup, and the nights sleeping in the same camp. Thanks to Milva, however, no one got seriously upset by this. In contrast to Geralt and Cahir,  who seemed to be prompted to adopt the style of the vampire and even to compete with him in  this regard, the archer Milva enacted a simple and unpretentious solution. The third time she  noticed him answer her in the middle of a question, she swore at him vigorously, using words  and descriptions that could even drive an old trooper to blush with shame. And, wonder of  wonders, it helped – the vampire laid aside the enervating style in a jiffy.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And even if I were, it would not justify you impersonating a crane to spy on my  notes!'   'I've already apologized,' Cahir reminded him dryly, as he set up his camp at the new  location. 'I've come to terms with things and gotten used to many things in this highly  esteemed company. But I still maintain that I only have to apologize once.'   'Indeed,' the Geralt agreed, which surprised everyone, including the young Nilfgaardian. 'You've become damned irritable, Dandelion. It's obvious that it's somehow related to the  paper you recently besmirched with that piece of lead.'    'True,' confirmed the vampire Regis, as he added some birch twigs to the fire.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Memoirs under the title Fifty Years of Poetry.'   'A silly title,' Cahir said dryly. 'Poetry has no age.'   'And if you insist that it has one,' added the Vampire, 'then it is decidedly older.'   'You don't understand. The title means that the author of the work has spent fifty years,  no more and no less, in the service of his mistress, poetry.'   'Then it is even greater nonsense' said the Geralt. 'You, Dandelion, are still not forty. Writing was drummed into you in the temple-cliff school with a cane in the butt when you  were eight.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'Indeed, and strongly,' claimed Dandelion. 'It also seems to me you are exaggerating,' said Cahir added carelessly. 'I do not know  how it is with the Nordlings, but it is not a crime to possess a manuscript in the empire, and  literary activity is not criminal.'   Geralt gave him a sidelong look and, with a loud crash, broke the branch with which he  had played. 'And yet libraries are set on fire in cities conquered by your cultured nation,' he  said in an engaging tone, but with clear undertones of accusation. 'But never mind that.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Don't you even dare, do you hear me?'      ***      It was strange that Milva had joined us and astonishing that the vampire kept us  company. But the strangest – and absolutely incomprehensible – motives were from Cahir,  who suddenly went from an enemy to something like a friend, or at least an ally. The young  man had proved that in the Battle on the Bridge when chose, without hesitation, to side with  the Geralt against his own people. Through that act, he had finally won our favour and  dispelled our doubts. When I write 'our', I refer to myself, the vampire and the archer.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble. He  was as noble as the cormorant who does not gobble a caught fish because it's had a choker  placed around its neck, making it impossible for it to swallow. He took the fish in his beak,  but could not swallow because he had to bring it back to his master.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"In truth, no  one actually knows. But one thing is certain, if the Druids catch you, they bind you to a  willow trunk and roast you. To go to them is to go to certain death.'   'We do not fear them,' said Geralt calmly. 'Of course.' The bee keeper looked at the Geralt, Milva, and Cahir, who had just come  into the hut after feeding the horses. 'One can see that you're not timid people, you're  combative and fortified.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And we will  provide you with food...'   'And the Druids,' Cahir said coldly, 'have moved away from Caed Dhu. And onto the  North Case. What a strange coincidence.'   Geralt walked slowly to the bee keeper. He grabbed him with both hands by the front of  his jacket. But immediately afterward he changed his mind, let go of the jacket, and smoothed  it.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Speak, lad. But  remember what you said, because you actually might end up in the ground!'   The bee keeper lowered his eyes and stared nervously at the ground under his feet. Geralt  eloquently remained silent. Milva, who had finally understood what the Geralt had implied,  cursed indecently. Cahir snorted disapprovingly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"It happened  one day after they had taken their leave of the bee keeper, who no longer needed the Geralt,  and whom the Geralt therefore never expected to see again. All the greater was his  astonishment. The bee keeper began by thanking Geralt wordily and handing him a small bag, full of  money, to pay his Geralt's fees. He accepted, feeling the slightly mocking glances of Regis  and Cahir. More than once during the march he had complained to them of human  ingratitude, emphasizing how futile and foolish objective altruism was.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"When the bee keeper  learned that the Druids were nearby, he came running to tell. And now he was beaming with  the contentment, pride, and importance that any liar has when their lie proves to be true by  chance. Geralt had originally planned to strike out immediately for Loc Monduirn, but his  companions protested vigorously. Regis and Cahir argued that they should use the money  from the bee keeper to replenish their supplies and equipment in the city. Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Six days before the autumn equinox. ***      Milva, Regis, and Cahir were in charge of making purchases and replenishing their  equipment. Geralt and Dandelion, in contrast, went out to get more news from the residents  of Riedbrune. Riedbrune was situated in a bend of the Newi River. It was a small town if you only  counted the brick and wooden buildings that were within the ring of palisade-crowned  earthworks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'You can order me. You brought me  out of jail and tore me from the clutches of Lord Fulk. You are now the leader of my  Hanse...'   'Be quiet, please.'   Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back,  because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir,  who rode ahead them. They rode towards the mountains, along the banks of the Newi River,  whose waters were cloudy yellow-brown after the recent rains, and streaked across stones and  swells. They were not alone.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"You let them hire you – what am I  saying, not only yourself, but all of us. We should all help the Nilfgaardians capture and put  to death any local predators. In short: You, Geralt, have become a Nilfgaardian mercenary, a  bounty hunter, a hired assassin. And we must play the role of your acolytes... your famuli...'   'You have an incredible talent for simplifying, Dandelion,' muttered, Cahir.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And they destroy the rabble. Which is us. Geralt, you should make one change to your  plans.'   'What?'   'If anyone is going to ride Belhaven and to Nightingale, it should be me, you and Lord  Cahir. And Aunty should ride with the others.'   'Why?' Geralt calmed Milva with a gesture. 'Because we need guys for this.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"I know what I'm talking about! If we get that far, we might be able to intimidate them rather than using force. And no one in  Nightingale's Hanse would be afraid of three people when two of them are women.'   'Milva rides with us.' Geralt's fingers clasped the shoulder of the archer, who was  furious. 'Milva, not Cahir. I do not want to ride with Cahir.'   'And why not?' Asked Angouleme and Cahir almost simultaneously.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"I do not want to ride with Cahir.'   'And why not?' Asked Angouleme and Cahir almost simultaneously. 'Indeed,' Regis said slowly. 'Why not?'    'Because I do not trust him,' the Geralt said shortly. The ensuing silence was awkward, heavy, almost sticky. The sounds of raised voices,  shouting, and singing, carried over from the forest, where a merchant caravan had camped  with another group of travellers.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"The sounds of raised voices,  shouting, and singing, carried over from the forest, where a merchant caravan had camped  with another group of travellers. 'Explain that,' Cahir said. 'Someone's betrayed us,' the Geralt said dryly. 'After speaking with the governor and  hearing Angouleme's information there is no doubt. And if you think about it, you come to  the conclusion that there is a traitor among us.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"There is good evidence. It would explain much. Very much.'   'Geralt,' said Dandelion. 'Aren't you going a bit too far?'   'Let him talk.' Cahir pursed his lips. 'Let him talk.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"A  Nilfgaardian, who wants to bring Ciri into his power so he can pass her to his Emperor  Emhyr, because his life and future career depend on this...?'   'So I was not wrong,' Cahir said slowly. 'I am a traitor. A vicious, duplicitous traitor?'   'Geralt,' Regis rejoined the discussion. 'Forgive my frankness, but your version is as full  of holes as an old sieve. And your way of thinking, as I've already told you, is ugly.'   'I am a traitor,' repeated Cahir, as if he had not heard the vampire's words.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"From what I understand, the burden falls on me  to prove my innocence. I'll have to prove that I am not a horse. Yes?'   'Without pathos, Nilfgaardian,' growled Geralt, who stood before Cahir and fixed his  eyes on him. 'If I had a proof of your guilt, I would waste no time talking, but cut you into  pieces like a herring! Do you know the principle of Cui Bono?",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"But I can do something else. That which I do when I or  something that I own is insulted – when my honour and dignity are kicked to the dirt and  defiled.'   His motion was lightning fast, but he wasn't fast enough to strike the Geralt, at least he  wouldn't have been if not for the Geralt's painful and aggravated knee. Geralt did not  completely succeeded with his dodge, and the gloved fist hit him on the cheek with such  force that he fell right back into the fire, sending sparks flying. He jumped up, slowed again  by the pain in his knee. Cahir was already with him.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And this time the Geralt was not able to  dodge him at all. Cahir thundered his fist against the side of his head, and colourful fireworks  flashed before his eyes, even more beautiful than those of the merchants. Geralt spat a filthy  curse and threw himself at Cahir, embracing him with his arms and throwing him to the  ground, where they rolled in the gravel and crashed fists. And all the while the sky was exploding with the spooky and unnatural light of artificial  fire. 'Stop it!' roared Dandelion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'Stop it, you are both damned idiots!'   Cahir struck Geralt, who was trying to get up, and knocked him off his feet again. The  blow positively boomed. Geralt turned over, pulled up, and kicked him in the hip. Again they  rolled around, one over the other, beating each other, blinded by the blows just as much as the  dust and sand in their eyes. And suddenly they parted, rolling away in different directions, hands curled above their  heads to protect themselves against the whistling blows raining down on them.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Milva had removed the wide leather belt from her hips and wrapped the buckle once  around her hand. She ran to the fighters and began to beat them with all her strength, sparing  neither her arm nor the belt. The belt whistled and clapped as it met with hands, shoulders,  back, or arms – sometime's Cahir's, sometimes Geralt's. When they parted, Milva jumped  back and forth between them like a grasshopper, still continuing to whip them, one no more  than the other. 'You stupid jerks!' She cried, and sent a blow crashing onto Geralt's back.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"I'll bring you to reason, both of you!'   'Enough?' She shouted even louder, while Cahir covered his head with one of his hands. 'Are you ready to act reasonably? Have you calmed down?'   'Ready!' bellowed the Geralt. 'Enough!'   'Enough,' agreed Cahir, curled up. 'Enough!'    'It's enough,' said the vampire.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Only one thing remained to be done. 'Come, all of you.'   They came. 'Cahir, son of Ceallach' began Geralt, trying not to sound pathetic. 'I have offended you  with an unwarranted suspicion and acted maliciously towards you. First, I do hereby  apologize, head bowed.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"A tracking spell will not show the vampire. Where the vampire is, says  the acquisition magic that no one had. Only a magician could therefore be mistaken in regard  to us as follows: to count four, when in truth we are five, that is, four men and a vampire.'   'We will take advantage of that error and get the magician,' the Geralt took the floor  again. 'Myself, Cahir, and Angouleme will ride to Belhaven and talk with the half-elf, our  would-be killer. We will not ask the half-elf at whose command he is working, because we  already know.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'That One-Eyed Fulk,' she said vaguely, as she eagerly rubbed a bit into her gums and  inhaled some through her nose, 'is a decent fellow after all. He took what he took, but he left  me the dust. Will you take a pinch, Geralt?'   'No. I would prefer if you also would take none.'   'Why?'   'Because.'   'Cahir?'   'I do not use Fisstech.'   'It seems I am among paragons of virtue.' She shook her head. 'Will you preach moral  certainty and lecture me that I will go blind, deaf, and hairless from the dust?",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"They already had me  stretched spread eagle on the ground when an officer came and forbade them the pleasure. Well, then you came and saved me from the gallows...'   She paused for a moment. 'Geralt?'   'I'm listening.'   'I know how I can prove my gratitude. If you just want to...'   'What?'   'I should go check on the horses,' Cahir said quickly, standing up and wrapping his coat  around him. 'I'll see how their feet are doing...'   The girl sneezed, sniffled, and cleared her throat.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Water flowed continuously and noisily through  the wooden troughs, which were supported on low-post cross gutters of a wooded hill. They    apparently derived somewhere down the slope. Angouleme dismounted and signalled for Geralt and Cahir to dismount as well. They tied  the horses to a fence and walked towards a building, trudging through mud next to leaky  gutters and pipes. 'The iron ore is washed here,' said Angouleme while pointing.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"He is, as I said, a...'   'Pit foreman. You said. But you have not said why you want to chat with him.'   'Take a look at your boots.'    Geralt and Cahir obediently looked at their shoes, which were covered in a strange,  reddish coloured mud. 'The half-elf you seek,' Angouleme answered the question before they  could ask it, 'was at the meeting with Nightingale with the very same reddish dirt on his  shoes. Get it now?'   'Now, yes.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Some of the miners  looked at them and then quickly looked away; others remained frozen with their mouths  open. Anyone that was in their way quickly moved aside. Geralt could imagine why. His face  still shone and Cahir's was still covered in stains, bruises, scratches and scrapes – the scenic  remnants of the fight and the beating Milva had given them. So they looked like individuals  who enjoyed cutting each other in the face, and who would also not take long to polish the  face of a third person.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'Tell me what you know. Otherwise I'll cut your throat so that  you'll drown before you bleed to death...'   'RIALTO'...' groaned the dwarf. 'In the mine named 'RIALTO'...'      ***      Only minor details distinguished the mine 'RIALTO' from 'LITTLE BABETTE', as well as  the other mines and surface-mines that Angouleme, Geralt, and Cahir passed by – 'THE  SPRING MANIFESTO', 'ALTERZ', 'NEUERZ', 'APRIL FOOLS', 'DULCINELLA',  'COMMON CAUSE' and 'HAPPY HOLE'. Work was in full swing in all of them – muddy  earth was brought out of tunnels or shafts, poured into troughs, and washed in sieves. All of  them had plenty of the characteristic red mud.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'I have business to discuss with Nightingale.'    'Interesting. He has business to discuss with you as well.'   'Shut up and listen for as long as I feel like talking. Two days ago, a mile away from  Riedbrune, these two friends of mine and I made cold the Geralt, the one Nightingale had  the job for. Do you understand?'   Novosad looked at his mates meaningfully, then straightened his gloves and looked at  Geralt and Cahir appraisingly. 'Your new friends,' he repeated slowly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"The  bandit dropped his sword and tore the knife out with both hands. Blood poured from his  throat as Angouleme jumped up and kicked him in the chest, knocking him to the ground. Meanwhile, Geralt had cut down another bandit. Cahir gave one mighty blow with his  Nilfgaardian sword and the head of a bandit fell, somewhat in the shape of a portion of  melon. The last bandit retreated and jumped on his horse.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"She  leaned across the table – and Schirru quickly grabbed her by the hair, threw her on the table,  and held a knife to her throat. The girl could not even cry. Geralt and Cahir had their swords in their hands. But too late. The half-elf's cronies, the musclemen with low foreheads, already had iron hooks in their  hands.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"This is not a stalemate, but a  checkmate! My friends have arrived.'   'Really?' said Cahir, looking out the window. 'I see the uniforms of the Imperial Light  Horse.'   'So it's a checkmate, but not for you,' said Geralt. 'You've lost, Schirru. Let the girl go.'   'No way.'   The door was kicked open and a dozen people stormed in, mostly black uniformed and  homogeneous.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Angouleme, released by Schirru, tried to run from the table, but was suddenly  grabbed by a burly, colourfully dressed man whose eyes bulged out like a frog's. She wanted  to scream, but the man pressed his gloved fist in her mouth. 'We avoid violence,' Geralt coldly told the leader with the bear. 'We are not criminals.'   'Well, is that so.'   'We act with knowledge and consent of Lord Fulk Artevelde, the governor of Riedbrune.'   'Well, is that also so,' repeated Bear, as he gestured for Geralt's and Cahir's swords to be  taken away. 'With the knowledge and consent of Lord Fulk Artevelde.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Angouleme tossed herself back and forth in the grip of Frogman, trying in vain to scream. It was not necessary. Geralt understood. Even before the smiling Schirru began to shake  hands with Bear. Even before four black Nilfgaardians grabbed Cahir and three others  pointed their crossbows directly at Geralt's face.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"'Catch a horse! Catch a horse!' Cahir was standing beside him; together they created a  sweeping sword strike area. Geralt did not listen to him, did not look at him. He went to the  next Nilfgaardian, looking for Schirru. Angouleme, on her knees, shot a crossbow bolt three feet away into the abdomen of one  of the bandits from the company that was supposed to protect the mining industry.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Then she  jumped up and grabbed the reins of a horse passing nearby. 'Catch one,' cried, Cahir. 'And get out of here!'   With an overhead blow, the Geralt split the next Nilfgaardian from sternum to the waist. He jerked his head and hurled the blood off his eyebrows and eyelashes. 'Schirru!",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Warm droplets on his face. 'Mercy!' wailed a man in a black uniform, who was kneeling in the mud. The Geralt  hesitated. 'Come to your senses!' roared Cahir, grabbing him by the shoulders and shaking him  vigorously. 'Come to your senses!",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And then, in the firelight, he saw Schirru in the midst of the screaming,  panicking remnants of the Nilfgaardians. Beside the half-elf, Nightingale croaked and cursed,  looking like a man-eating troll with his bloody face. Geralt roared in anger, turned his horse, and whirled his sword. Next to him Cahir cried, began to curse, and reeled in his saddle, blood running spilling  from his forehead and instantly covering his eyes and face. 'Geralt!",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
Cahir did  not matter. Angouleme did not matter... 'Geralt!' shouted Angouleme. 'Help Cahir!'   He came to his senses. And he was ashamed.,The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Cahir wiped the blood from his face with his sleeve, but the blood once again flowed  down it. 'It's nothing, a scratch...' His voice trembled. Get out of here, Geralt... gallop after  Angouleme... gallop!'   Loud cries sounded from the foot of the hill – a crowd approached, armed with pickaxes,  crowbars, and hatchets.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"***      They rushed forward without looking back, clinging to the necks of their horses. The best  horse had fallen to Angouleme, a bandit's small but spirited animal. Geralt's horse, a bay  stallion with a Nilfgaardian bridle, began to wheeze and gasp and had trouble even keeping  its head up. Cahir's horse, also from the military, was stronger and more enduring, but that  made no difference because its rider was troubled. He reeled in his saddle, instinctively  pressed his thighs together, and sprayed blood on the neck and mane of his mount.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"The sight was grim. 'How did this happen?'   'He simply had an axe thrown at his head. And the funniest thing is, it was neither a black  nor any of Nightingale's men, but one of the miners.'   'It does not matter who it was,' the Geralt wrapped Cahir's head tightly with a torn shirt  sleeve. 'What is important and fortunate is that the thrower had lousy aim and only scalped  him, or else he would have a split skull. But the skull bone has still taken some hurt.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Geralt saw that some of the pursuers' horses were not in the best condition. There were very few black coated Nilfgaardian light cavalry among the pursuers; it was  dominated by Nightingale's brightly clothed bandits. Geralt couldn't make out whether  Nightingale himself participated in the pursuit, or whether he had cleaned and bandaged his  slashed face. As the sound of hooves faded into the distance, Geralt got out of his hiding place in the  bracken, lifted the moaning and groaning Cahir, and held him steady. 'The horse is too weak  to carry you.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Cahir fell down the last dozen steps on  the slippery slope, pretty desolate as he slipped down. He crawled to the stream, drank plenty  of water, and poured some over his bandaged head. The Geralt did not urge him to hurry –  he just breathed a deep breath, gathering strength. They went up the creek, where he assisted Cahir and simultaneously pulled the horse to  be. They trudged through the water, placing their feet against rocks and fallen logs.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"After a  while Cahir could go no further – he no longer obediently put one foot in front of the other,  he no longer moved, the Geralt had to drag him. They could not go on like this, especially as  the stream bed was interrupted by waterfalls and rapids. Geralt groaned and carried the  wounded man on his back. The horse that he towed along behind him did not make his life  any easier either. When they finally came out of the ravine, the Geralt collapsed on the wet  forest floor and lay breathing heavily, completely exhausted, beside the groaning Cahir.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Then he slowed down. Then he fell. Geralt took turns carrying him on his back and dragging him, groaning, pushing against  rocks. Pain raged in his knee, and black and fiery bees swarmed in his vision. 'A month ago...' Cahir began to moan from his back.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"He bravely and confidently  endured the suturing of the flap of skin, done with the aid of a curved needle and thread. The    crisis came later in the night. Geralt decided to kindle a fire in the cave, ignoring the security  issue. It was raining and storming outside, so it was hardly likely that someone roamed the  area, watching for firelight. And Cahir and had to warm up.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"And he spoke with confidence. He  complained of a headache – a normal occurrence for someone who had been hit in the head  with an axe and had the skin, along with the hair, severed from his head. Geralt divided his time between dawns and restless evenings gathering trickling rainwater  from the rocks and birch bark bowls. Both Cahir and he were tormented by thirst. 'Geralt?'   'Yes.'   Cahir straightened the logs in the fire with the help of a leg bone he had found.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"As if nothing mattered to you... except for killing...'   'I know.'   'I feared,' concluded Cahir quietly, 'that you would in your state you would kill Schirru. And from the dead we could not gather any information.'   Geralt cleared his throat. He liked the young Nilfgaardian more and more. Not only was  brave, but also intelligent.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Yes, Cahir. You're right.'   'And you? Have you had any more dreams?'   'Yes,' said the Geralt bitterly. 'But very rarely since we crossed the Yaruga. And I  cannot remember them at all after waking.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Something inside me has stopped, Cahir. Something has burned. Something inside me has been torn completely...'   'That's okay, Geralt. I dream enough for the both of us.'      ***      They journeyed forth at dawn. It had stopped raining, it even looked as if the sun was  trying to find some hole in the gray clouds that covered the sky.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"We'll see, Cahir.'   'Lead me not astray. Be honest. You're not going to allow me to take her.'   Geralt did not answer. Cahir did not repeat the question. 'Until then,' he asked coldly, 'can we be friends?'   'Yes, Cahir.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"Those who formerly lived in Angra, in Caed Dhu, then migrated to Loc Monduirn and finally  to Myrkvid in Toussaint. We were destined to eventually meet with them. Do you not  remember that I said that long ago.'    Geralt took a deep breath. Cahir was riding behind him. 'Is your friend among these Druids?'   The vampire smiled again.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"In the best  case. And if this is not a mockery...'   'I would not call it a mockery under any circumstance,' Regis said firmly. 'Under no  circumstances, Geralt of Rivia.'   'So, what is it? One of the Druid's famous oddities?'   'We will not know,' said Cahir, 'until you find out. Come on, Geralt, we'll go in there  together...'   'No,' the vampire shook his head.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"I would not have believed she had such deep feelings for him... Well, I  am satisfied with what we have initially learned. The Geralt, Cahir aep Ceallach, the poet  Dandelion, and a woman? Hmmm... Who will take this job?",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Cahir
"What we concluded was that  she really had gotten over the crisis. The third and no less strange member of our company was a Nilfgaardian, who wanted to  prove that he was not a Nilfgaardian. Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, as he claimed... ***      'Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, son of Ceallach' Dandelion said emphatically, as he aimed the  little lead pencil at the Nilfgaardian. 'I have to accept a lot of things in this highly esteemed  company that I do not like, things that I almost cannot stand.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion
"Stop torturing me! Tell me  what you write?'   'Memoirs.'   'How?'   'From these notes' – Dandelion showed them a tube filled with papers – 'my life's work  will be created. Memoirs under the title Fifty Years of Poetry.'   'A silly title,' Cahir said dryly. 'Poetry has no age.'   'And if you insist that it has one,' added the Vampire, 'then it is decidedly older.'   'You don't understand. The title means that the author of the work has spent fifty years,  no more and no less, in the service of his mistress, poetry.'   'Then it is even greater nonsense' said the Geralt.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion
"They might hang us for his  scrawl.'   'You are exaggerating, Milva,' the vampire said mildly. 'Indeed, and strongly,' claimed Dandelion. 'It also seems to me you are exaggerating,' said Cahir added carelessly. 'I do not know  how it is with the Nordlings, but it is not a crime to possess a manuscript in the empire, and  literary activity is not criminal.'   Geralt gave him a sidelong look and, with a loud crash, broke the branch with which he  had played. 'And yet libraries are set on fire in cities conquered by your cultured nation,' he  said in an engaging tone, but with clear undertones of accusation.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion
"Heroic! Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble. He  was as noble as the cormorant who does not gobble a caught fish because it's had a choker  placed around its neck, making it impossible for it to swallow.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion
"They were equipped with the six  wagons, twelve oxen, ten cows, four goats and sheep, and an ample amount of all kinds of  dogs and cats. The amount of barking and meowing taking place under these circumstances  undoubtedly had to be considered a bad omen. 'I want to know' – Cahir rubbed his eyes – 'what is this supposed to mean?'   'Trouble,' observed Dandelion, pulling straw from his hair. Regis was silent, but his  expression was strange. 'We invite the noble lords to breakfast,' said the bee keeper when he noticed them.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion

"Therefore, I will not let  him down. I will bring him to Belhaven, to Nightingale, and to this half-elf. I will go along  with him.'   'I, too,' Cahir said immediately. 'And I likewise!'

'Shut up.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion
"It would explain much. Very much.'   'Geralt,' said Dandelion. 'Aren't you going a bit too far?'   'Let him talk.' Cahir pursed his lips. 'Let him talk. Let him do what he wants.'

"And this time the Geralt was not able to  dodge him at all. Cahir thundered his fist against the side of his head, and colourful fireworks  flashed before his eyes, even more beautiful than those of the merchants. Geralt spat a filthy  curse and threw himself at Cahir, embracing him with his arms and throwing him to the  ground, where they rolled in the gravel and crashed fists. And all the while the sky was exploding with the spooky and unnatural light of artificial  fire. 'Stop it!' roared Dandelion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Dandelion

"And she says to call her by her name: Yennefer of Vengerberg.'   The audience began to murmur. Hardly two months had passed since the events on  Thanedd Island, and they still remembered the names of the Nilfgaard-bought traitors. Especially the famous Yennefer.

"Then, in expiation, he'll do some grand, but pointless deed. In the  end, he'll be slain, stupidly and needlessly, most likely by a stab in the back.'

In the rooms that had been made available to  Yennefer a mad hustle dominated and Seneschal Guthlaf accommodated the sorceress only  with great difficulty.

'Hail, Revered Mother Sigrdrifa.'   The priestess was tall, almost as big as Crach – and that meant that she was a head taller  than Yennefer.

"Nothing  but common murderers!'   'I confess', Hotsporn gestured for Giselher to reseat himself, because he had risen at Ciri's  repeated interference, 'that Miss Falka's knowledge continues to shine brilliantly here.

But she    – Ciri, not the witch – was able to flee and seek asylum in the empire.'   'That is one big, bloody, clusterfuck of lies and nonsense!'

"There is a chance... a  shadow of a chance... that Ciri was the one who travelled through the portal of Tor Lara. That  she escaped Nilfgaard and Vilgefortz...'   'Where is she then?'   'I would also like to know that.'      ***       It was devilishly dark out. The clouds clustered together to hide the moon behind them,  letting through almost no light.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Lara
"If you doze off and I fall asleep too, we will be carried by the current  and will wake up in the sea! Tell me more of this teleporting!'   'When you fled from Thanedd,' continued the hermit, 'you went through the portal at Tor  Lara, the Tower of Gulls. However, Geoffrey Monck – who is the highest authority in  matters of teleportation and the author of a book titled The Magic of the Elder Races, which  is the magnum opus of knowledge of elven teleports – writes that the portal at Tor Lara leads  to Tor Zireael, The Tower of the Swallow...'   'The portal at Thanedd was broken,' interrupted Ciri. 'Maybe before it broke down it lead  to a tower. But now it leads to the desert.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Lara
"'The portal at the Tower of Gulls,' resumed Vysogota 'leads to the Tower of the Swallow. The Tower of the Swallow, but...'   The cat had eaten the mouse, leaving only the tail for dessert. 'The portal from Tor Lara,' said Ciri as she yawned heartily, 'is broken and leads to the  desert. That's what I've told you more than a hundred times.'   'That doesn't matter for the moment. There is a connection between these two portals.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Lara
"Lara Dorren's heritage? What  exactly is this gene? How is it that Ciri has it? Who did she inherit it from? In what way will I  get it from her, and what am I going to use it for?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Lara
"I've made an effort...'   'I do not pay you for efforts but for results. And they are moderate, Vattier, moderate! What of the matter with Vilgefortz? Where the hell is Ciri? What are you mumbling?",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"Find me Ciri. Find Cahir. And  Vilgefortz. Because I'm sure wherever Vilgefortz is, Ciri is near.'   'Your Imperial Majesty...'   'I'm listening Vattier! I've been listening this whole time!'    'In the past, I've suspected that the matter with Vilgefortz was an ordinary provocation.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"Specifically, experiments on human  embryos... and pregnant women. So if Vilgefortz had Ciri in his power, then I fear that the  continued search for her...'   'Shut up, damn it!'   'On the other hand,' Vattier de Rideaux hastily steered the conversation away, obeying  the unspoken order in the Emperor's angry eyes, 'it could all be disinformation. To discredit  the magician. That would be like Dijkstra.'   'You should remove him and find Vilgefortz and Ciri!",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"'You're risking a lot to show your scorched  visage in Nilfgaard. Ahh, it must be a magical teleprojection...'   'You've noticed? Vilgefortz guaranteed that no one will be able to guess that it is an  illusion without contact.'   Vattier put away the stiletto. He had guessed that it was an illusion, but now he knew it. 'Rience,' he said, 'you're too cowardly to show up here in person.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"'Rience,' he said, 'you're too cowardly to show up here in person. You know what you  could expect.'   'The emperor is still prejudiced against me? And against my master Vilgefortz?'   'Your insolence is disarming.'   'Hell, Vattier. I assure you that we are still on your side, myself and Vilgefortz. Well, I  confess we have betrayed you, because we gave you the wrong Ciri, but that was done in  good faith, may I be drowned if I lie.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"'You've got it.'   'What I have got?'   'Cahir. We will procure the head of Cahir for you. Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier. 'Modify the sequence of names, but still...'   'As you wish. Vilgefortz – with my humble help – will procure for you the head of Cahir,  son of Ceallach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"We can get it.'   'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened  on Thanedd.'   'That will probably be better,' replied Rience cynically. 'Why give Cahir the opportunity  to give speeches? Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor,  not to deepen it. I will procure the silent head of Cahir aep Ceallach. We will regulate it so  that the merit goes to you and only you.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"I bet you do not understand.'    Rience remained silent, so Skellen continued. 'You know, Rience, I counselled Vattier de Rideaux to burn your heels even then, seven  years ago, when you crawled up to the imperial intelligence like a dog, begging for the  privilege to be a double agent. I gave him the same advice four years ago, when you climbed  in Emhyr's ass and started meditating contact with Vilgefortz. And when you received the  task of hunting the Cintran, you moved from an ordinary little traitor to a resident. I bet  Vattier that if we gave you a taste of red-hot iron, we'd find out who you served...",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"Besides, Vattier  is a Viscount and you are nothing.'   'Certainly,' said The Owl. 'I'm too intelligent not to have noticed. So then, now I am to  betray Ardal aep Dahy and join you, Vilgefortz? Is that what you want? But I'm not a  weather vane on a tower!",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"Schirru volunteered to kill the Geralt. He knew the area where Yennefer had detected Geralt and his company – he had friends or  relatives there. I, however, Vilgefortz sent to the negotiation with Vattier de Rideaux, and  then to track down Skellen and Bonhart... And I was a fool then, happy because I was sure I had fallen to the far easier and more  enjoyable task. And one that I could finish quickly, easily, and with pleasure...",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Vattier
"'It is not fear, just  concern. For her. I saw her in a dream...'   'I saw her too,' Triss pursed her lips, 'we had the same dream, you, me and Nenneke. But  not a word about it.'   'The blood on her face... So much blood...'   'I have asked you to be quiet.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"Nenneke is coming.'   The high priestess approached them. Her face was tired. At Triss' silent question, she  shook her head. Noticing Jarre opening his mouth, she hastened to speak. 'Unfortunately, nothing.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"And you will come back. Take your belongings, and  farewell.'   'Farewell, Mother.'   They left the temple at a brisk pace, not looking back. They followed the two girls with  their eyes – the High Priestess Nenneke, the sorceress Triss Merigold, and the scribe Jarre. The latter gave a strong, meaningful cough. 'What?' Nenneke looked sideways at him.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"The full  moon. 'I am ready, mother,' said Iola the First with her melodic voice. 'Go ahead.'   'Wait a minute.' Triss rose from the bench like a spring and threw the chinchilla fur coat  from her shoulders. 'One moment, Nenneke. I want to go into a trance along with her.'   'That is dangerous.'   'I know.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"You're an adult and,  supposedly, should be wise magician. You should know that you cannot help Ciri by going  into a trance. What you can do is hurt yourself.'   'I will go along with Iola in a trance,' repeated Triss as she bit her lip. 'Allow me to  Nenneke. By the way, what do I risk it?",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"By the way, what do I risk it? An epileptic seizure? Even if that happened, you'd  get me out.'   'You risk,' said Nenneke slowly, 'seeing something that you must not see.'   The thought of Sodden Hill filled Triss with horror. Where I am dead. Where I am buried  and my name is carved into the obelisk monument.",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"For this, however, I  needed someone with whom the girl had a sufficiently strong emotional connection and has  developed an empathic matrix algorithm and mutual sympathy, to borrow a neologism. I  thought of the Geralt, but he has vanished, and also Geralts are unsuitable to use as  mediums. I was about to abduct Triss Merigold, our Fourteenth of the Hill. I have considered  the kidnapping of Nenneke from Ellander... But then came along Yennefer of Vengerberg,  you almost volunteered...",The Tower of the Swallow,Triss,Nenneke
"And even if I were, it would not justify you impersonating a crane to spy on my  notes!'   'I've already apologized,' Cahir reminded him dryly, as he set up his camp at the new  location. 'I've come to terms with things and gotten used to many things in this highly  esteemed company. But I still maintain that I only have to apologize once.'   'Indeed,' the Geralt agreed, which surprised everyone, including the young Nilfgaardian. 'You've become damned irritable, Dandelion. It's obvious that it's somehow related to the  paper you recently besmirched with that piece of lead.'    'True,' confirmed the vampire Regis, as he added some birch twigs to the fire.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Memoirs under the title Fifty Years of Poetry.'   'A silly title,' Cahir said dryly. 'Poetry has no age.'   'And if you insist that it has one,' added the Vampire, 'then it is decidedly older.'   'You don't understand. The title means that the author of the work has spent fifty years,  no more and no less, in the service of his mistress, poetry.'   'Then it is even greater nonsense' said the Geralt. 'You, Dandelion, are still not forty. Writing was drummed into you in the temple-cliff school with a cane in the butt when you  were eight.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Indeed, and strongly,' claimed Dandelion. 'It also seems to me you are exaggerating,' said Cahir added carelessly. 'I do not know  how it is with the Nordlings, but it is not a crime to possess a manuscript in the empire, and  literary activity is not criminal.'   Geralt gave him a sidelong look and, with a loud crash, broke the branch with which he  had played. 'And yet libraries are set on fire in cities conquered by your cultured nation,' he  said in an engaging tone, but with clear undertones of accusation. 'But never mind that.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Where the scribe is, is also the judge', he always    said, 'today they are writing to you, tomorrow they hang on you.' And he was right, although  he was a scumbag like no other. I hope that he's stewing in hell, the son of a bitch!'   Milva threw off the blanket and sat down by the fire, finally giving up on sleeping. It  looked, Geralt noticed, like it would once again be a long night of conversation. 'You did not like your stepfather, I take it,' said Dandelion after a short silence. 'I did not.' Milva audibly gritted her teeth.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"It was on the third day after we had  crossed the Yaruga, and ten days before the equinox, as we moved through the forests of  Riverdell. Although very short, the conversation was nevertheless full of unpleasant and  disturbing sounds. And the Geralt's face and eyes already marked him as the harbinger of  the atrocity that later erupted on the night of the equinox, after the fair-haired Angouleme  had joined us. ***      The Geralt did not look at Dandelion. He did not look forward.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble. He  was as noble as the cormorant who does not gobble a caught fish because it's had a choker  placed around its neck, making it impossible for it to swallow. He took the fish in his beak,  but could not swallow because he had to bring it back to his master.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"This resentful annoyance is  obviously no use to you. He saved Ciri. That is and remains a fact.'   Geralt finally unlocked his gaze from Roach's mane, lifting his head. Dandelion glanced  at his face and then hurriedly looked away. 'The fact of the matter remains' the Geralt repeated in an evil, metallic voice.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"A long chain of death, a chain of revenge, one  which people would still be talking about after a hundred years. One that people would be  afraid to talk about after dark. Do you understand that, Dandelion?'   'Not particularly.'   'Then go to the devil.'      ***      That conversation was disgusting, and the Geralt's face was repulsive during it. Oh  dear, I did not like it when he got into such moods, talking about stuff like that. I must confess, however, that after his pictorial comparison with a cormorant – I began to  get restless.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'We'll make  pancakes with honey, and then you can eat. But allow the girl to grind the corn into flour in  peace, because unless you brought a magician, there can be no pancakes without flour! Let  her work in peace.'   'Did you hear that, Dandelion?' cried the Geralt. 'Let the girl work in peace and occupy  yourself with something useful. Or write your memoirs!'   'I want to drink.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"That's right. To the  North Case.'   'Some sixty miles south,' estimated Dandelion unconcernedly, almost cheerfully. Under  the Geralt's gaze, however, he quieted immediately. In the ensuing silence, the only sound was the evil meowing of the cat as it was chased  out of the house. 'Well,' said the vampire, 'what does difference does it make?'      ***      The following morning brought more surprises.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks. Dandelion wanted to spend at least one night sleeping  in a bed in an inn, where he could bathe and enjoy a nice beer before bedtime. The Druids, everyone told Geralt, would not run away. 'Although it is pure coincidence,' said the vampire Regis with a strange smile, 'Our team  is definitely on the right track and absolutely headed in the right direction. Therefore, it is  apparent that we are inevitably destined to encounter the Druids.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Six days before the autumn equinox. ***      Milva, Regis, and Cahir were in charge of making purchases and replenishing their  equipment. Geralt and Dandelion, in contrast, went out to get more news from the residents  of Riedbrune. Riedbrune was situated in a bend of the Newi River. It was a small town if you only  counted the brick and wooden buildings that were within the ring of palisade-crowned  earthworks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"It has not been commanded to arrest you. If it had been commanded, sir, I would have asked you differently. Quite differently.'    Geralt adjusted his sword belt rather pointedly. 'And I,' he said coldly, 'would have  responded differently.'   'Come, come, gentlemen.' Dandelion decided to intervene, and he put something on his  face that resembled a politician's smile. 'Why this tone?",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Freedom, as the  name suggests, is something for peace. But as for the reason, that will be explained to you by  the governor. I carry out commands, not discussions.'   'Where he's right, he's right,' conceded the Geralt and winked easily at the troubadour. 'So lead me to the governor, honourable soldier. You, Dandelion, go back to the others and  tell them what happened.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"You, Dandelion, go back to the others and  tell them what happened. Do what needs to be done. Regis will know.'      ***      'What does a Geralt want on the North Case? What is he doing here?'   The question was asked by a broad-shouldered, dark-haired man with a scarred face and a  leather patch over his left eye socket. The sight of this cyclopean face in a dark alley would  have elicited horror in many.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'You're going to make  jokes on the scaffold, Angouleme. Which is fine with me. Who is Geralt travelling with?'   'I have already told you this also! With a pretty boy named Dandelion, a troubadour who  has a lute. With a young woman who has dark blond hair, worn in a braid that is cut at the  neck.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"'You can order me. You brought me  out of jail and tore me from the clutches of Lord Fulk. You are now the leader of my  Hanse...'   'Be quiet, please.'   Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back,  because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir,  who rode ahead them. They rode towards the mountains, along the banks of the Newi River,  whose waters were cloudy yellow-brown after the recent rains, and streaked across stones and  swells. They were not alone.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"And the sharp  needle of Gorgon, the Devil's Mountain, which sank into the clouds that covered the whole  sky. 'When will you tell them?' the vampire asked, pointing to the three riding ahead of them. 'When we make camp.'      ***      Dandelion was the first person to speak after Geralt had finished. 'Correct me if I'm  wrong,' he said. 'That girl you've willingly and without any conditions accepted into our  company is a criminal.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"You let them hire you – what am I  saying, not only yourself, but all of us. We should all help the Nilfgaardians capture and put  to death any local predators. In short: You, Geralt, have become a Nilfgaardian mercenary, a  bounty hunter, a hired assassin. And we must play the role of your acolytes... your famuli...'   'You have an incredible talent for simplifying, Dandelion,' muttered, Cahir.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Moreover, Nightingale has many friends and allies in Belhaven and the  surrounding area. And if you don't know the way, there are several paths that do not lead to  the city. I tell you: The Geralt will not succeed alone. I don't know what customs prevail  with you, but I will not leave the Geralt in the lurch.

"He accepted me into your company,  like Uncle Dandelion said, 'willingly and without any conditions', even though I'm a  criminal... my hair still stinks of prison, because I haven't been able to wash it yet...

"'It is not Dijkstra. Nor Vissegerd. Nor Meve.'   'Who then?'   'Any judgment, any conclusion would be premature.'   True,' said the Geralt coldly. 'That case must be examined on the spot. And the  conclusions can be drawn from the autopsy.'   'But I,' insisted Dandelion, 'still consider this idea to be stupid and risky.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"There is good evidence. It would explain much. Very much.'   'Geralt,' said Dandelion. 'Aren't you going a bit too far?'   'Let him talk.' Cahir pursed his lips. 'Let him talk.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"And this time the Geralt was not able to  dodge him at all. Cahir thundered his fist against the side of his head, and colourful fireworks  flashed before his eyes, even more beautiful than those of the merchants. Geralt spat a filthy  curse and threw himself at Cahir, embracing him with his arms and throwing him to the  ground, where they rolled in the gravel and crashed fists. And all the while the sky was exploding with the spooky and unnatural light of artificial  fire. 'Stop it!' roared Dandelion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"I managed to persuade her. And Dandelion, instead of  rejoicing in the asylum, which the duchy gives, showed considerable displeasure... Any idea  what our poet is so afraid of in Toussaint?'   'I don't know, but I can guess,' Geralt said sourly. 'Because it would not be the first place  where our friend, the bard visited. Now he has settled down a little, because he is keeping  decent company, but in his youth he was not known for his holiness.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Suddenly without warning, the picture became clear and sharp. Too sharp. 'Dandelion,' shouted Geralt. 'Milva! Angouleme!'   'What?' Avallac'h became interested.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Where is Dandelion and Angouleme?'   'In the cabin with the pilgrims... Oh, shit.'   From the fog emerged three riders on war steeds, their coats and banners fluttering in the  wind. Geralt was expecting their battle cry. But Milva grabbed him and dragged him under a  wagon. There was no joking with someone who rode up armed with a length of spear  fourteen feet long, giving them an effective range of ten feet in front of their horse's head.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"He is called, Geralt of Rivia.'   'Coat of Arms?'    'I must not disclose,' growled the Geralt, 'my real name, nor coat of arms. I made a vow  of chivalry. Now I am errant Geralt.'   'Ooo!' suddenly shouted a familiar cheeky voice. 'Look what the cat dragged in! Ha, I  told you, auntie that the Geralt would come to our rescue!'   'And just in time!' Dandelion shouted, coming up together with Angouleme and a small  group of pilgrims, a lute in one hand and his trusty pipe in the other.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"Ha, I  told you, auntie that the Geralt would come to our rescue!'   'And just in time!' Dandelion shouted, coming up together with Angouleme and a small  group of pilgrims, a lute in one hand and his trusty pipe in the other. 'And not a second too  soon. You have a sense of drama, Geralt. You ought to write works for the theatre!'   He stopped suddenly. Bull's head leaned forward in his saddle, his eyes flashing.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"The second knight-errant, a practical man, had  prepared a noose and went to look for good branches. 'Neither of them Nightingale,' Angouleme pointed out to the Geralt, 'or Schirru. It's a  pity.'   'A pity,' admitted Geralt, 'but I will try to fix it. Sir Knight...'   But Bull's head – or rather Baron de Peyrac-Peyran, was not paying any attention to him. He saw, it seemed, only Dandelion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"This is Viscount Julian himself. Ha! The duchess will be delighted.'   'Who is this Viscount Julian?' asked the Geralt, intrigued. 'I am,' Dandelion said under his breath.

"Geralt, Milva, Angouleme,  we will be at the castle!'      ***      The forded the river, spurring their horses into the woods, among the spreading oaks, the  ferns reached up to their stirrups. Milva effortlessly found the trail of the band of fugitives. They travelled as fast as possible – Geralt feared for the Druids. He feared that the remnants  of the bandits, feeling safe, would take their revenge on the knights of Toussaint by  massacring the Druids. 'What do you have to say about Dandelion?' Angouleme said.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion

'Dandelion?'   'Exactly. Vissegerd accused both of espionage, placed them under arrest, and wanted to  put them to death, but the two prisoners escaped and rushed towards the Nilfgaardians that  Vissegerd had alleged they were plotting with.'   'Nonsense.'   'I think so too. But I'm feeling that the Geralt, contrary to what you think, is perhaps  pursuing some cunning plan.",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion
"I would not have believed she had such deep feelings for him... Well, I  am satisfied with what we have initially learned. The Geralt, Cahir aep Ceallach, the poet  Dandelion, and a woman? Hmmm... Who will take this job?",The Tower of the Swallow,Geralt,Dandelion

"'You've got it.'   'What I have got?'   'Cahir. We will procure the head of Cahir for you. Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier. 'Modify the sequence of names, but still...'   'As you wish. Vilgefortz – with my humble help – will procure for you the head of Cahir,  son of Ceallach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"We can get it.'   'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened  on Thanedd.'   'That will probably be better,' replied Rience cynically. 'Why give Cahir the opportunity  to give speeches? Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor,  not to deepen it. I will procure the silent head of Cahir aep Ceallach. We will regulate it so  that the merit goes to you and only you.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"I bet you do not understand.'    Rience remained silent, so Skellen continued. 'You know, Rience, I counselled Vattier de Rideaux to burn your heels even then, seven  years ago, when you crawled up to the imperial intelligence like a dog, begging for the  privilege to be a double agent. I gave him the same advice four years ago, when you climbed  in Emhyr's ass and started meditating contact with Vilgefortz. And when you received the  task of hunting the Cintran, you moved from an ordinary little traitor to a resident. I bet  Vattier that if we gave you a taste of red-hot iron, we'd find out who you served...",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"He liberally  sprinkled the handkerchief and held it to his nose. The perfume smelled pleasantly of musk,  yet Kenna wanted to vomit. 'The iron, Mister Brigden.'   'I followed you on Vilgefortz command!' Rience cried. 'It is the girl! I was following  your squad; I was hoping to stall you before you got to this bounty hunter!",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"What you have captured gentlemen, is something a little bit too big for both  of you. Fortunately, you still have me.'   'What is that?' Skellen rose from his chair. 'What the hell is that?'   'My master, the sorcerer Vilgefortz,' Rience pulled out from under his arm a silver shiny  box. 'More specifically, the voice of my master. Coming from this magical device called a  Xenophon.'   'I greet all those present,' said the box.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"'It is a shame I can only hear you, but some urgent  matters prevent me from teleprojecting or teleportation.'    'Shit, this is all we need,' The Owl swore. 'But I should have guessed that Rience was too  stupid to act on his own. I should have known that you were hiding in the darkness,  Vilgefortz. Like an old fat spider, lying in waiting in the dark, waiting for the web to vibrate.'   'What a most offensive comparison.'   Skellen snorted. 'And do not try and deceive us, Vilgefortz.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Ordinary citizens of all  backgrounds, through the most worth and honourable representatives arising from fair  elections...'   Rience roared with laughter. Bonhart thunderously joined him. A warm, if somewhat  grating laugh came from the sorcerer Vilgefortz through the Xenophon. All three laughed  until they cried. 'Come,' Bonhart interrupted the mirth.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"How enchanted. 'Magical bullshit,' commented Bonhart coldly. 'It's broken – the cheap fairground trick.'    'Or Vilgefortz is demonstrating how important we really are to him,' added Stefan  Skellen. Rience raised his head and measured both of them with evil eyes. 'Thanks to this  fairground trick,' he noted sharply, 'we are on the track and will no longer lose her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
It is Rience...'   The machine was silent. Rience didn't even curse. Vilgefortz is silent. Skellen and Bonhart have made an agreement with him. But in a day  or two when we catch up to the girl it may turn out that there is no agreement.,The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"I swear it.'   Yennefer gritted her teeth even more. A trail of blood flowed over her chin. Vilgefortz abruptly stood up and waved his hand. 'Rience!'   Yennefer felt a device being attached to her hands and fingers. 'Sometimes,' said Vilgefortz bent over her, 'there are stubborn situations in which magic,  potions, and narcotics simply cannot substitute, good old, classic pain.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"'Sometimes,' said Vilgefortz bent over her, 'there are stubborn situations in which magic,  potions, and narcotics simply cannot substitute, good old, classic pain. Do not make me do  so. Locations.'   'Go to hell, Vilgefortz!'   'Pull the screws, Rience. Slowly.'      ***      Vilgefortz looked at the unconscious body being dragged across the floor towards the  stairs that led into the dungeon. Then he looked up at Rience and Schirru.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Yes, I would like to believe that. But I do not.'   Rience and Schirru remained silent. Vilgefortz turned again to the megascope, where an  image appeared on the screen, produced by the giant crystal. 'That's all she located,' he said, pointing at the screen. 'I wanted Ciri and she has given  me the Geralt.",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"The horror doubled  his strength; although Rience was bigger, heavier, and bulkier, he shook like a rag doll in  Skellen's grip. 'Do something! Call your mighty Vilgefortz! Or do some magic yourself! Say  a spell, call spirits, summon demons!",The Tower of the Swallow,Vilgefortz,Rience
"Always the same mud and same  water lilies. 'Your price Rience?'   'A trifle. Where is Stefan Skellen and what are his plans?'      ***      'I told him what he wanted to know.' Vattier de Rideaux stretched out on the pillow while  he played with a golden lock of Carthia van Canten's hair. 'You see, my sweet, certain things  have to be addressed wisely. And 'wise' means conforming.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"Only rotten stinking mud and water in a basin. And what did they expect when the  basin is made of marble and just a few steps from the palace? Am I right, my sweet?'   Carthia van Canten, nicknamed Cantarella, did not answer. Vattier did not expect her to. The girl was eighteen years old and, generally speaking, not the brightest.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"A natural talent, he thought. And then the soft,  hot, and velvety-to-the-touch lips banished every thought from his head. Carthia van Canten bestowed her talent to Vattier de Rideaux, chief of the imperial  intelligence, slowly and skilfully. This was not Carthia's only talent. But Vattier de Rideaux  had no idea of that.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"But Vattier de Rideaux  had no idea of that. He did not know that, despite appearances, Carthia van Canten possessed an excellent  memory and an intelligence like quicksilver. Everything Vattier told her, every scrap of information, every word that he had uttered to  her during their meeting – Carthia repeated the following morning to the sorceress Assir var  Anahid. ***      Yes, I'll bet my head that no one in Nilfgaard even remembered Cahir, not even his  fiancé, if he had one. But more about that later, first we will return to the day and place that we crossed the  Yaruga.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"'Interesting,' she said. 'The two nobles offended that their daughters were excluded from  Emhyr's marriage plans. Our Emperor is either very naïve or very clever.'   'If Emhyr knew anything about the noble's conspiracy,' said Carthia, 'it was not from  Vattier. He did not say anything to him.'   'Go on.'   'Never before has there been a military operation of this scale. In total, counting the  frontline units, reserves, auxiliary services and the rear-guard, the operation will be attended  by over three hundred thousand people.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"He is cunning, our Emperor. He was close.'   'Close.' Assire murmured. 'What else, Carthia?'   'The agent who Vattier put in Skellen's band and who disappeared along with him, was  named Neratin Ceka. Vattier must value him very much, because he was extremely angry  about his disappearance.'   I, too, thought Assire, am furious by the disappearance of Jediah Mekesser. But I, unlike  Vattier de Rideaux, I will soon know what happened.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"Vattier did not mention it.'   Both were silent a moment. The silence was broken by Assire's cat purring loudly. 'Lady Assire.'   'Yes, Carthia.'   'Do I have to play the role of the silly lover for a long time? I would like to go back to  school, to devote myself to scientific research...'    'Soon,' interrupted Assire. 'A little bit longer.",The Tower of the Swallow,Carthia,Vattier
"'You? What could  you give me? Perhaps the real Ciri? Maybe your boss, Vilgefortz? Perhaps Cahir aep  Ceallach?'   'Halt!' The illusion of Rience raised his illusory hand.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"But let's not get ahead of events. For now, I just want to convey my  greetings and make a promise. You do not have anything against that, I hope?'   'You are free to wait for whatever you want.'   Rience approached Ciri; he looked closely into her eyes. 'Your guardian, the witch Yennefer,' he hissed viciously, 'once crossed my path. When  she fell into my hands, I, Rience, taught her pain.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"'Very risky, Mister Rience, or whoever you are, to tease  my girl and threaten her. She is vindictive, prepare to remember that. Keep, I repeat, your  hands and fingers and all other body parts away from her.'   'Enough,' Skellen snapped, not taking his eyes from Ciri. 'Leave him, Bonhart. And you,  Rience, calm down too.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"Especially with the  regeneration of the eyeball, there are problems... The crystal I have in my eye socket serves  its purpose well – I see three dimensions, but the lack of a natural eyeball sometimes really  drives me to despair. Indeed, I've developed an irrational anger – I swear that when I capture  Ciri, immediately afterwards I'll instruct Rience to remove one of those big green eyes. With  his fingers. These fingers, as he likes to say.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"And smiled. Boreas Mun saw the hideous  scar and with difficulty repressed a scream. 'Rience' said Ciri, still smiling. 'You wanted to teach me what pain is. Do you  remember?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"With these? With which you are now holding  onto the ice?'   Rience replied, but Boreas did not understand it, because the magician's teeth were  chattering so much that articulate speech was impossible. Ciri turned around on the ice and  lifted her sword with one hand. Boreas gritted his teeth, convinced that she would deal a    death blow to Rience, but the girl only got momentum going. To the vast astonishment of the  tracking detector, she ran away quickly, accelerated with sharp foot movements.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Rience
"Just the right facets for the refraction of light...'   'That means we're in luck.'   'Hardly. Here they are priestesses, and I'm a ungodly witch to be thrown out in disgrace.'   'You're exaggerating?'   'Not a bit.'   'Be welcome, Earl, in the temple of the Mother. Be thou also welcome, worthy Yennefer  of Vengerberg.'   Crach an Craite bowed. 'Hail, Revered Mother Sigrdrifa.'   The priestess was tall, almost as big as Crach – and that meant that she was a head taller  than Yennefer. She had light hair and eyes, and an elongated, not very pretty and not very  womanly face.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"We are women. It does not matter what profession  we pursue or who we are: We are virgins, mothers, and crones. Kneel down next to me,  Yennefer. Bow your head to the Mother.'      ***    'Take the Brisingamen from the Goddess' neck?' Repeated Sigrdrifa, the disbelief in her  voice battling holy outrage. 'No, Yennefer.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"I admire you for the  determination with which you rush to help the child. I will fulfil your every wish. But not the  Brisingamen, Yennefer. Not the Brisingamen. Please, do not ask.'   'Sigrdrifa, to come to Ciri's rescue I have to quickly acquire some knowledge.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"It is symbolized by the  jewel of the Goddess: the Brisingamen, the collar of clairvoyance. Why build any seeing and  listening devices, Yennefer? Is not it easier to turn to the Goddess for help?'   Yennefer restrained herself from cursing at the last moment. After all, this was a place of  worship. 'It is almost time for the evening prayer,' continued Sigrdrifa.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"Aurora Borealis? In August? 'How much will you sacrifice Yennefer?'   'What?'   'Are you willing to sacrifice yourself? Your priceless magic?'   'Sigrdrifa,' she said angrily. 'Do not try these hackneyed tricks with me.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"I fell asleep at your service. I  got bored. Because I do not believe in your goddess.'   Sigrdrifa turned around, and Yennefer involuntarily took a very deep breath. 'Your disbelief is not too flattering for me', said the woman, whose eyes were full of  liquid gold. 'But does your disbelief do anything?'   The only action Yennefer could take was to exhale.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"But I can guess. The grace... You may have fallen to the grace of the goddess, Yennefer.'   'What are you talking about, Sigrdrifa?'   'Look.'   She looked up. And sighed loudly. Brisingamen, the sacred jewel of Modron Freyja no longer hung on the neck of the  goddess.",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"I really do not know if...'   'Modron Sigrdrifa.' Crach an Craite interrupted seriously. 'What I ask for is not a  betrayal. Like you, I support Yennefer. Like you, I hope that she finds and rescues Ciri. Ha,  I've taken a Bloedgeas, a blood oath!",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"A  pretty, oi, a beautiful chunk of money my oath has cost me! But money comes and goes. What I've spent on Yennefer and Ciri, I'm going to repeat on the Nilfgaardian provinces. But  keep talking, Mother Sigrdrifa.'   'Some' – the priestess bowed her head -'Yennefer blackmailed easily. She indicated that    she was in possession of compromising information and that if cooperation was refused she  would reveal it to the whole world...",The Tower of the Swallow,Yennefer,Sigrdrifa
"Yennefer had taught her – count in advance and with a cool head, because later, when things  heat up, the head takes on a strange reluctance for calculating, along with an inclination to  take consequences too lightly. Hotsporn looked into her eyes and smiled, as if he knew that the calculation had come out  in his favour. If only he were not so old, Ciri secretly sighed. He must be more than thirty. 'Tourmalines.' Hotsporn's fingers gently touched her ear and the earring.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Before anyone arrived to  investigate us, we were already on the left bank of the Yaruga, deep in the forests of Riverdell  – where there was only one highway, leading south. To us, neither the direction of the  highway nor the number of Nilfgaardians travelling on it was convenient. At the first camp in the woods of Riverdell, I also had a strange dream – unlike Geralt I  dreamed not of Ciri, but of the sorceress Yennefer. The dream was strange, worrisome –  Yennefer was dressed, as usual, in black and white and flew through the air over a dark,  small, mountain castle, while other sorceresses underneath her shook their fists at her and  shouted insults. Yennefer waved the long sleeves of her dress and flew away like a black  albatross, out into a boundless sea, opposite the rising sun.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Ten years ago. To the same person. Ciri, the granddaughter of  Calanthe. The lion cub of Cintra. I, Yennefer of Vengerberg, care for Ciri as my daughter.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Damn, I already said... Yennefer, various rumours have reached us from the mainland... Some say that Ciri is in Nilfgaard...'   'She's not in Nilfgaard.'   'Others say that the girl is no more.'    Yennefer remained silent, biting her lip. 'But with this second rumour', the Earl said firmly, 'I disagree. Ciri lives.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Yennefer,' Crach said after a while. 'There are other messages that have come from the  continent. I understand that your Geralt, who stayed in Brokilon after the fight on Thanedd,  has set out from there to reach Nilfgaard and liberate Ciri.'   'I repeat, Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. And what my Geralt, as you call him, intends to do, I  do not know. But he...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"He'll vent his anger and hack at anyone and  anything he comes across. Then, in expiation, he'll do some grand, but pointless deed. In the  end, he'll be slain, stupidly and needlessly, most likely by a stab in the back.'   'It is said', Crach threw in quickly, frightened by the ominous changes and strange  trembling voice of the sorceress, 'that Ciri is his destiny. I've seen it myself, back in Cintra, at  Pavetta's betrothal...'   'Predestination,' Yennefer sharply interrupted him, 'can be interpreted in different ways. Very different ways.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"But not the  Brisingamen, Yennefer. Not the Brisingamen. Please, do not ask.'   'Sigrdrifa, to come to Ciri's rescue I have to quickly acquire some knowledge. Some  information. Without it, I am powerless.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"'It is almost time for the evening prayer,' continued Sigrdrifa. 'Together with the other  priestesses, I will dedicate my time to meditation. I'm going to ask the Goddess to help Ciri. For Ciri was here in this temple many a time and has many a time seen the Brisingamen on  the neck of the Great Mother. Sacrifice another hour or two of your valuable time, Yennefer.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"As the representative of Ciri, as her only guardian, you have a formal right to order  me and to demand obedience and service.'   'Casuistic quibble.'   'Sure.' He laughed. 'I myself will call it such loudly, if after all it turns out that Emhyr var  Emreis has forced the girl to marry him. Even if Ciri is ruled out by any legal manoeuvrings  of the throne and someone else takes her place, such as that idiot Vissegerd. Then I will  immediately renounce my oath of obedience and fealty.'   'What if' – Yennefer narrowed her eyes -'it turns out that despite everything Ciri is  dead?'   'She's alive,' said Crach firmly. 'I know she is safe.'   'How?'   'You would not believe me.'   'Try me.'   'The blood of the queens of Cintra,' began Crach in a thoughtful tone, 'is strangely  connected with the sea.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Three  times. After the death of Adalia the Seer, after the death of Calanthe... And after the death  Pavetta, the mother of Ciri.'   'Pavetta' remarked Yennefer, 'was killed during a storm, so one can hardly say that...'   'Pavetta' interrupted Crach, still thoughtfully, 'was not killed during a storm. The assault  began after her death. The sea, as usual, responded to the death of someone of Cinterein  blood.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"What it does it matter now who serves whom, who is on whose  side, and who remained loyal to whom for what reasons? Yennefer is no longer alive. It is  still not known where Ciri is and in whose power... What is the sense of this secrecy? I did  not come as a spy, Crach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"'What I ask for is not a  betrayal. Like you, I support Yennefer. Like you, I hope that she finds and rescues Ciri. Ha,  I've taken a Bloedgeas, a blood oath! But Yennefer worries me, I am guided by concern for  her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer

She indicated that    she was in possession of compromising information and that if cooperation was refused she  would reveal it to the whole world...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Then you know a lot Yennefer. A  lot. Calanthe's anger and bans lasted no longer than six months, and then Ciri once again  started to spend summers and winters here... and to skate. She was quick as hell, but that she  would compete with the other boys in 'Salmon Jumps'?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Now you're trying to forestall us from finding Ciri, and the motives that  guide you are opposed to ours. You act against us. You do not want to allow us to use Ciri for  our political purposes. You should know that we will also do everything in our power to  make sure that you cannot use the girl for your sentimental purposes.'   'So its war?'   'Competition.' Philippa smiled toxically. 'Competition only, Yennefer.'   'Decent and honourable?'   'You must be joking.'   'Obviously.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer, Dijkstra has found some traces of... some  traces of certain activities have been found. If Vilgefortz does have Ciri, then the girl faces a  horrible death.'   'Be quiet, Triss,' Philippa Eilhart hissed sharply. 'We are not trading or bargaining.'   'I will leave you the information', Yennefer said slowly. 'I'll leave you the information on  what I've found and what I plan.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"But let's not get ahead of events. For now, I just want to convey my  greetings and make a promise. You do not have anything against that, I hope?'   'You are free to wait for whatever you want.'

"Damn it! I'm freezing out  here and Schirru is surely sitting in the warmth... When I think that I myself urged that I be sent after Ciri and Schirru be sent after the  Geralt... I myself asked for it. Back then, in the beginning of September, when Yennefer fell into our hands.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"Then he stood before her and took off his mask. Yennefer sighed involuntarily. 'This is the work of that very same Ciri,' he said, pointing to the once classically  beautiful, now horribly ravaged face that was framed by gold clasps and retainers that held a  multi-faceted crystal in the left eye socket. 'I tried to catch her when she entered the portal in  the Tower of Gulls,' said the sorcerer quietly. 'I wanted to save her life, I was sure the portal  would kill her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"But it could not.'   Yennefer was quite enmeshed in a web of silver and copper wires, surrounded by a  scaffolding of tubes made of silver and porcelain. Tripods mounted on the chair held glass  vials that fluctuated with colourless liquids. 'I've therefore concluded' – Vilgefortz pushed another tube into her nose, this time it was  made of glass – 'that the only way to locate Ciri is an empathic probe. For this, however, I  needed someone with whom the girl had a sufficiently strong emotional connection and has  developed an empathic matrix algorithm and mutual sympathy, to borrow a neologism. I  thought of the Geralt, but he has vanished, and also Geralts are unsuitable to use as  mediums.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"But then came along Yennefer of Vengerberg,  you almost volunteered... Really, I could not have hoped for anyone better... Connected to the  apparatus, you will locate Ciri for me. The operation, however, requires cooperation on your  part... But there are, as you know, means to force someone to cooperate.'   'Of course,' he continued as he wiped his hands, 'you should get a few explanations.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"The sooner you start with the  locations, the sooner it's over. Well, Yennefer. Here on this screen, I want to see Ciri. Where  she is, whom she is with and what she is doing, along with where and with whom she is  sleeping.'   Yennefer screamed piercingly, wildly, desperately. 'It hurts,' Vilgefortz fixed both his living eye the dead crystal eye on her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
Locations. I beg you. I give you my word: I will only take from Ciri  what I need. And then I'll give you both your freedom. I swear it.'   Yennefer gritted her teeth even more.,The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Yennefer
"And I do not intend to accept  it!'   The Nilfgaardian moved away from the poet and, after a brief reflection, grabbed his  saddle and blanket coat, and pulled them closer to Milva, who appeared to be dozing. 'Sorry,' he said. 'Forgive the intrusion, Dandelion. I sat looking quite automatically, from  ordinary curiosity. I thought you were drawing a map or making calculations.'   'I'm not an accountant!' The poet jumped up, literally and figuratively.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"I'm not stupid! We are on an expedition to come to the aid Ciri, going into an enemy country with weapons  in our hands. It may be that Dandelion's scribblings fall into the enemy's hands. And we all  know the rhymer, it's no secret that he's a chatterbox and a gossip. They might hang us for his  scrawl.'   'You are exaggerating, Milva,' the vampire said mildly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"I hope that he's stewing in hell, the son of a bitch!'   Milva threw off the blanket and sat down by the fire, finally giving up on sleeping. It  looked, Geralt noticed, like it would once again be a long night of conversation. 'You did not like your stepfather, I take it,' said Dandelion after a short silence. 'I did not.' Milva audibly gritted her teeth. 'Because he was a bastard.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Saved her. Heroic! Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Regis winked at him. They both knew very well that the  rumours that circulated about the Druids were invented. Milva and Dandelion, on the other  hand, listened with more interest now than before. And with obvious anxiety. 'Some say,' continued the bee keeper, 'that the mistletoe cutters are exacting vengeance  against the Nilfgaardians, who started it all by harassing the Druids, namely because they  marched through Dol Angra and the sacred oak groves and started to attack the Druids  without reason.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Regis and Cahir argued that they should use the money  from the bee keeper to replenish their supplies and equipment in the city. Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks. Dandelion wanted to spend at least one night sleeping  in a bed in an inn, where he could bathe and enjoy a nice beer before bedtime. The Druids, everyone told Geralt, would not run away. 'Although it is pure coincidence,' said the vampire Regis with a strange smile, 'Our team  is definitely on the right track and absolutely headed in the right direction.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Six days before the autumn equinox. ***      Milva, Regis, and Cahir were in charge of making purchases and replenishing their  equipment. Geralt and Dandelion, in contrast, went out to get more news from the residents  of Riedbrune. Riedbrune was situated in a bend of the Newi River. It was a small town if you only  counted the brick and wooden buildings that were within the ring of palisade-crowned  earthworks.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"'You can order me. You brought me  out of jail and tore me from the clutches of Lord Fulk. You are now the leader of my  Hanse...'   'Be quiet, please.'   Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back,  because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir,  who rode ahead them. They rode towards the mountains, along the banks of the Newi River,  whose waters were cloudy yellow-brown after the recent rains, and streaked across stones and  swells. They were not alone.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"I will go along  with him.'   'I, too,' Cahir said immediately. 'And I likewise!' Milva said fiercely. Dandelion pressed the tube with the manuscripts to his chest. He had not separated from it  recently, even for a moment. You could tell that he was struggling with his thoughts.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"to finally get a leader.'      ***      Everyone, except for Angouleme, looked at him expectantly. 'Myself, Angouleme, and Milva,' he said, 'will ride to Belhaven. Cahir, Regis, and  Dandelion will turn at the Sansretour Valley and ride to Toussaint.'    'No,' said Dandelion, quickly and firmly grabbing his tube. 'Not at any price. I cannot...'   'Shut up.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Angouleme  shrieked, fell down, and began to cry. 'I told you,' Milva came out breathing hard, 'not to call me that again. I told you!'   'Nothing's happened!' Dandelion somewhat shakily assured the merchants and travellers,  who had come running from their nearby fires. 'Just a little misunderstanding among friends. A difference of opinion among friends.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Cahir, Angouleme: to the horses. We ride along the  Newi, then we ascend to Belhaven. Dandelion, Milva, Regis: follow the Sansretour to the  borders of Toussaint. You cannot miss the way, the Gorgon will show you. See you soon.'      ***      Ciri stroked the black tomcat, who had returned to the hut in the swamp.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Your horse is strong, it will withstand the gallop. And even if you have to ride it to death... Angouleme, somewhere in the Sansretour Valley Regis, Milva and Dandelion are waiting for  us. They know nothing and could fall into Schirru's hands. You have to find and warn them,  and then all four off you ride for Toussaint.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"are terribly  greedy. Physiologus                                                    Chapter Seven         'They're safe,' confirmed the vampire, spurring his mule, Draakul. 'All three of them –  Milva, Dandelion and of course, Angouleme, who in time overtook us in the valley of  Sansretour and told us everything, without sparing us the picturesque words. I could never  understand why you humans have so many curses and insults related to the spheres of  eroticism. After all, sex is beautiful and is associated with beauty, joy and pleasure.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"In truth, Milva was against it, and was eager  to turn around and seek you both out. I managed to persuade her. And Dandelion, instead of  rejoicing in the asylum, which the duchy gives, showed considerable displeasure... Any idea  what our poet is so afraid of in Toussaint?'   'I don't know, but I can guess,' Geralt said sourly. 'Because it would not be the first place  where our friend, the bard visited.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Suddenly without warning, the picture became clear and sharp. Too sharp. 'Dandelion,' shouted Geralt. 'Milva! Angouleme!'   'What?' Avallac'h became interested.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"Come on. I still have some  outstanding accounts with Nightingale, and you, so I guess, would still like to have a chat  with a certain half-elf.'   'I'm going with you,' said Milva. 'As soon as I find myself a horse.'   'Me too,' blurted Dandelion. 'I, too, am with you...'   'Oh, not you won't!' cried the baron. 'On my honour, Viscount, you will ride with us to  Beauclair.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"A duchess,  ha, ha!'   'It was quite a few years ago. Count Rajmund, the one who kicked the bucket, apparently  swore that he would rip out the heart of the poet, cook it and send it to the Duchess and make  her eat it. Dandelion was lucky not to have fallen into the clutches of the Count while he was  still alive. And we are lucky...'   'That remains to be seen.'   'Dandelion says the Duchess Anarietta loves him to madness.'   'Dandelion always says that.'   'Close your mouths!' Milva barked, pulling on her reins and reaching for her bow. Dodging from oak to oak, speeding towards them was a bandit, he had no hat, no  weapons and he ran blindly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Dandelion,Milva
"So:  That battle took place on the last day of August during the Great War. It was fought in  Angren, on the bridge connecting the two shores of the river Yaruga near a fortress called  the Red Binduga. The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army  Corps of Lyria – led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company – myself, the writer of  these lines, the Geralt Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the  archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian  who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a  Nilfgaardian. You, reader, might be unclear on how the Queen came be alive and in Angren, as you  may have heard that she disappeared and perished along with her army when the  Nilfgaardians thrust into Lyria, Rivia and Aedirn in July, which ended with the complete  subjugation of those countries and their occupation by Imperial troops. Meve was not,  however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"The Nilfgaardians, who had fled in an unknown direction,  had lost the battle. I realize that this all sounds pretty confusing and I promise to consult a  military theorist before publishing. For now I am relying on the authority of Cahir aep  Ceallach, the only soldier in our company – and Cahir has confirmed that, from the  perspective of most military doctrines, winning a battle through the rapid escape of the  battlefield is allowed. Without a doubt, our company's part in the battle was glorious, however it had some  negative effects. Milva, who was pregnant, suffered a tragic accident.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"To me, a person who has never been guilty of anything, they tried to attach  the charge of espionage. In addition was Milva who, as it turned out, had collaborated with  the Dryads and the Scioa'tael and had been involved in the infamous massacres of people on  the edges of Brokilon Forest. On top of that was Cahir aep Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who  was, after all, a citizen of a hostile country, and whose presence on the wrong side of the  front would not be easy to explicate and justify. As it turned out, the only member of our  company whose career was not tainted with political or criminal affairs, was a vampire. Therefore, it was sufficient that only one of us needed to be exposed and identified in order to  bring sharpened aspen stakes on all of us.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"The knight Geralt of Riva was reminded in a cold,  but firm tone of his duties to the Crown. The still-ailing Milva, the vampire Regis and the  author of these lines were advised to join the column of refugees and civilians who followed  the camp. Cahir aep Ceallach, a tall young man who looked nothing like a civilian, had a  blue and white sash tied to him and was assigned to the so-called Free Company – a cavalry  unit comprised of all sorts of scum the Lyrian Corps had picked up along the way. And so we  were separated and it looked like it our expedition had come to a definite and irrevocable  conclusion. As you can imagine, dear reader, that was by no means the end.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Yes, it was not even the  beginning! As soon as Milva learned of the development of things, she immediately declared  herself to be healthy and fit for travel – and issued the watchword to escape at the first  opportunity. Cahir threw the royal colours in the bushes and disappeared from the Free  Company, and advised Geralt to do the same from the exquisite luxury tents of the  knighthood. I will not indulge details about myself – my modesty does not allow me to highlight my  own achievements in the company's escape – though they were not small. I will only state the  facts: On the night between September fifth and sixth, our company quietly left the Corps of  Queen Meve.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"After all, we deserved a bonus for  our participation in the memorable Battle for the Bridge. And if not a reward, at least  satisfaction and compensation for the losses suffered. Apart from Milva's tragic accident and  the numerous injuries and wounds Geralt and Cahir had sustained, all of our horses had  been killed or maimed in the battle – excepting my trusty Pegasus and the wayward Roach,  the mare of the Geralt. So, as recompense, we took three thoroughbred horses and a pack  horse. We also provided ourselves with as much equipment as we could fit into our hands – in  fairness I should add that we threw half of it away later.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"He said it would be dangerous  and he would not force anyone to take responsibility for anyone else. He spoke and grumbled  so bleakly and without conviction that no one wanted to discuss it with him. The usually eloquent vampire dismissed him with a shrug, Milva spat, and Cahir dryly  recalled that he had already attempted to travel alone, but, in regards the risk, said that he  who wears the sword should not complain about the belt. And then they all fell silent and  focused their attention on the significant writer of these lines, no doubt expecting that I would  take the opportunity to return home. I need not add that they were very mistaken.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"I need not add that they were very mistaken. The event, however, led us to make an end to our miasma, and provided the impetus for a  bold act – crossing the Yaruga. I confess that I worried about the operation – the plan called  for, namely, crossing the river at night while swimming, or, as Milva and Cahir put it, 'being  towed by the horse's cocks'. Even if they were speaking metaphorically – and I suspect that  they were – I could not imagine myself on such a crossing on my gelding Pegasus, on whose  cock I would have to rely. Swimming, generally speaking, was not and is not my particular  strength.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Of course, it could be an ordinary swindle, for who among us  would be able to verify it? But I preferred to believe that our vampire was telling the truth,  because he had also told us that he had irrevocably abandoned the practice of drinking  human blood – and thanks to this statement, we slept a little easier at night. Initially I noticed  that Milva and Cahir tended to timidly rub their necks after waking, but they stopped that  quickly. Regis was – or seemed to be – a vampire of absolute honour. He had vowed he  would not suck blood, therefore he sucked none.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"I've always held this supposed evidence of high  intelligence is instead evidence of rudeness and arrogance, properties that fit well in the  university environment or circles at court, but are difficult to endure from a companion with  whom you spend the day riding stirrup to stirrup, and the nights sleeping in the same camp. Thanks to Milva, however, no one got seriously upset by this. In contrast to Geralt and Cahir,  who seemed to be prompted to adopt the style of the vampire and even to compete with him in  this regard, the archer Milva enacted a simple and unpretentious solution. The third time she  noticed him answer her in the middle of a question, she swore at him vigorously, using words  and descriptions that could even drive an old trooper to blush with shame. And, wonder of  wonders, it helped – the vampire laid aside the enervating style in a jiffy.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"They might hang us for his  scrawl.'   'You are exaggerating, Milva,' the vampire said mildly. 'Indeed, and strongly,' claimed Dandelion. 'It also seems to me you are exaggerating,' said Cahir added carelessly. 'I do not know  how it is with the Nordlings, but it is not a crime to possess a manuscript in the empire, and  literary activity is not criminal.'   Geralt gave him a sidelong look and, with a loud crash, broke the branch with which he  had played. 'And yet libraries are set on fire in cities conquered by your cultured nation,' he  said in an engaging tone, but with clear undertones of accusation.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Don't you dare! Don't you even dare, do you hear me?'      ***      It was strange that Milva had joined us and astonishing that the vampire kept us  company. But the strangest – and absolutely incomprehensible – motives were from Cahir,  who suddenly went from an enemy to something like a friend, or at least an ally. The young  man had proved that in the Battle on the Bridge when chose, without hesitation, to side with  the Geralt against his own people. Through that act, he had finally won our favour and  dispelled our doubts.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Heroic! Noble!'   Dandelion held Pegasus back a little. They rode in the rear – Regis, Milva and Cahir were  a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this  conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship. 'The problem is,' continued the Geralt, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble. He  was as noble as the cormorant who does not gobble a caught fish because it's had a choker  placed around its neck, making it impossible for it to swallow.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"But one thing is certain, if the Druids catch you, they bind you to a  willow trunk and roast you. To go to them is to go to certain death.'   'We do not fear them,' said Geralt calmly. 'Of course.' The bee keeper looked at the Geralt, Milva, and Cahir, who had just come  into the hut after feeding the horses. 'One can see that you're not timid people, you're  combative and fortified. Ha, those such as you can go peacefully...",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Geralt  eloquently remained silent. Milva, who had finally understood what the Geralt had implied,  cursed indecently. Cahir snorted disapprovingly. 'And?' urged the Geralt. 'Where have the Druids gone?'   'Well sir, who should know where they are,' the bee keeper finally stammered.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"And now he was beaming with  the contentment, pride, and importance that any liar has when their lie proves to be true by  chance. Geralt had originally planned to strike out immediately for Loc Monduirn, but his  companions protested vigorously. Regis and Cahir argued that they should use the money  from the bee keeper to replenish their supplies and equipment in the city. Milva added that  they should buy some arrows, because they constantly needed to hunt game and she didn't  intend to shoot with sharpened sticks. Dandelion wanted to spend at least one night sleeping  in a bed in an inn, where he could bathe and enjoy a nice beer before bedtime.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"It was the seventeenth of September, the full moon. Six days before the autumn equinox. ***      Milva, Regis, and Cahir were in charge of making purchases and replenishing their  equipment. Geralt and Dandelion, in contrast, went out to get more news from the residents  of Riedbrune. Riedbrune was situated in a bend of the Newi River.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"'You can order me. You brought me  out of jail and tore me from the clutches of Lord Fulk. You are now the leader of my  Hanse...'   'Be quiet, please.'   Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back,  because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir,  who rode ahead them. They rode towards the mountains, along the banks of the Newi River,  whose waters were cloudy yellow-brown after the recent rains, and streaked across stones and  swells. They were not alone.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Therefore, I will not let  him down. I will bring him to Belhaven, to Nightingale, and to this half-elf. I will go along  with him.'   'I, too,' Cahir said immediately. 'And I likewise!' Milva said fiercely. Dandelion pressed the tube with the manuscripts to his chest.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"to finally get a leader.'      ***      Everyone, except for Angouleme, looked at him expectantly. 'Myself, Angouleme, and Milva,' he said, 'will ride to Belhaven. Cahir, Regis, and  Dandelion will turn at the Sansretour Valley and ride to Toussaint.'    'No,' said Dandelion, quickly and firmly grabbing his tube. 'Not at any price. I cannot...'   'Shut up.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"And they destroy the rabble. Which is us. Geralt, you should make one change to your  plans.'   'What?'   'If anyone is going to ride Belhaven and to Nightingale, it should be me, you and Lord  Cahir. And Aunty should ride with the others.'   'Why?' Geralt calmed Milva with a gesture. 'Because we need guys for this.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"If we get that far, we might be able to intimidate them rather than using force. And no one in  Nightingale's Hanse would be afraid of three people when two of them are women.'   'Milva rides with us.' Geralt's fingers clasped the shoulder of the archer, who was  furious. 'Milva, not Cahir. I do not want to ride with Cahir.'   'And why not?' Asked Angouleme and Cahir almost simultaneously. 'Indeed,' Regis said slowly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Milva had removed the wide leather belt from her hips and wrapped the buckle once  around her hand. She ran to the fighters and began to beat them with all her strength, sparing  neither her arm nor the belt. The belt whistled and clapped as it met with hands, shoulders,  back, or arms – sometime's Cahir's, sometimes Geralt's. When they parted, Milva jumped  back and forth between them like a grasshopper, still continuing to whip them, one no more  than the other. 'You stupid jerks!' She cried, and sent a blow crashing onto Geralt's back.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"'Are you ready to act reasonably? Have you calmed down?'   'Ready!' bellowed the Geralt. 'Enough!'   'Enough,' agreed Cahir, curled up. 'Enough!'    'It's enough,' said the vampire. 'It really is, Milva.'   The archer was breathing heavily, rubbing her forehead with the hand that had the belt  wrapped around it.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"He jammed on Regis' hood. Once again, he checked the position of the Sihil on the back and the two stilettos in his boots. Nearby, Cahir sharpened his long Nilfgaardian sword. Angouleme wrapped a woollen  band around her forehead and stuck a hunting knife stuck in her boot – a gift from Milva. The  archer and Regis saddled their horses.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"With the method of Lord Fulk Artevelde,  the clever Lord Fulk, who knows how to treat criminals with the gallows. We will make a  deterrent example that will amaze even him!'   'Let us begin our journey to hell! Cahir, Angouleme: to the horses. We ride along the  Newi, then we ascend to Belhaven. Dandelion, Milva, Regis: follow the Sansretour to the  borders of Toussaint.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"Anyone that was in their way quickly moved aside. Geralt could imagine why. His face  still shone and Cahir's was still covered in stains, bruises, scratches and scrapes – the scenic  remnants of the fight and the beating Milva had given them. So they looked like individuals  who enjoyed cutting each other in the face, and who would also not take long to polish the  face of a third person. The dwarf, Angouleme's friend, stood beside a carpentry building, painting an inscription  on something like a blackboard, which was cobbled together from two planed boards.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Milva
"The depressing rainy weather and the forced idleness spoiled the mood and provoked  dark thoughts to arise in us. Especially in the Geralt. Geralt had earlier acquired the habit  of calculating the days he had been separated from Ciri – and every day that he was not  travelling, as he said, separated them more and more. Well, in the wet willows, in the cold  and the rain, the Geralt grew darker and more grim by the hour. I also noticed that he was  limping badly, and if he believed that no one can see or hear him, he cursed and hissed in  pain.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Before anyone arrived to  investigate us, we were already on the left bank of the Yaruga, deep in the forests of Riverdell  – where there was only one highway, leading south. To us, neither the direction of the  highway nor the number of Nilfgaardians travelling on it was convenient. At the first camp in the woods of Riverdell, I also had a strange dream – unlike Geralt I  dreamed not of Ciri, but of the sorceress Yennefer. The dream was strange, worrisome –  Yennefer was dressed, as usual, in black and white and flew through the air over a dark,  small, mountain castle, while other sorceresses underneath her shook their fists at her and  shouted insults. Yennefer waved the long sleeves of her dress and flew away like a black  albatross, out into a boundless sea, opposite the rising sun.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"For  although Geralt had fought shoulder to shoulder with Cahir, and although he had stood at  his side, facing death, he still looked at the Nilfgaardian suspiciously and never considered  him with favour. Though he sought to hide his resentment, when a person is – as I have  probably already pointed out – as straightforward as a halberd shaft, it cannot be helped and  at every turn the antipathy crept out like an eel from a leaky bucket. The reason was obvious, and it was Ciri. As fate willed it I was on the island of Thanedd during the new moon in July, when the  bloody conflict between magicians broke out. On one side were sorcerers loyal to the kings,  on the other side were traitors incited by Nilfgaard.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"The branch's leaves were completely yellow. 'Nevertheless he saved her life, as you have said yourself. Thanks to him, Ciri came away  from Cintra unscathed.'    'And cried at night because she saw him in a dream.'   'Yet it was he who saved her. Stop trying to be so vindictive Geralt. Too much has  changed, what am I saying, too much is changing day by day.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Too much has  changed, what am I saying, too much is changing day by day. This resentful annoyance is  obviously no use to you. He saved Ciri. That is and remains a fact.'   Geralt finally unlocked his gaze from Roach's mane, lifting his head. Dandelion glanced  at his face and then hurriedly looked away.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"But more about that later, first we will return to the day and place that we crossed the  Yaruga. We rode in somewhat of a rush to the east, towards the Black Forest, known as Caed  Dhu in the Elder Speech. We sought the Druids who would able to predict Ciri's whereabouts  and may be able to interpret the strange dreams that haunted Geralt. We rode through the  forests of the upper Riverdell, which the left bank is also called, a wild and almost  uninhabited region. It is located between the Yaruga and the foothills of Amell Mountains, an  area called the 'North Case', It is bordered on the east by the valley of Dol Angra and on the  west by a marshy lake district, whose name escapes me.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"The chair wobbled. 'She's young,' muttered the guard as he rubbed his hand on his hip. 'Reckless...'   Geralt already saw that it was not Ciri, and could only wonder at his confusion. A thin  trail of blood ran from the girl's upturned nose. The girl pulled air hard through her nose and  smiled predatorily.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"From the beginning, from that moment the company  was formed after eating the famous fish soup. When it enrolled in its ranks a Nilfgaardian. A  Nilfgaardian, who wants to bring Ciri into his power so he can pass her to his Emperor  Emhyr, because his life and future career depend on this...?'   'So I was not wrong,' Cahir said slowly. 'I am a traitor. A vicious, duplicitous traitor?'   'Geralt,' Regis rejoined the discussion.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Now he lay on girl's lap, offering his neck to pet and purring with pleasure. The tomcat did not give a damn about the girl's tale. 'That was the only time that I dreamed of Geralt,' continued Ciri. 'I had not once seen  him in a dream since the time we parted on the island of Thanedd, since the Tower of Gulls. Therefore I thought he was dead.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"He bear-hugged  Angouleme and began to throw her back and forth. She groaned in pain. Through the red mist  of anger in Geralt's eyes, the girl began again to resemble Ciri. 'Grab them,' Bear said impatiently. 'Take them outside.'   'This is a Geralt,' said one of the bandits from Nightingale's mining protection company  uncertainly.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Geralt, revenge must not be our purpose. We need to capture this half-elf... force  him to tell us where Ciri is...'   'Ciri is no longer alive.'    'That's not true. I do not believe she is dead... And you do not believe it either.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Admit it.'   'I do not believe it.'   Outside, the storm howled and the rain roared. Inside the cave it was snug. 'Geralt?'   'I'm listening.'   'Ciri lives. I had another dream... Yes, something happened at the equinox, something  fatal...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"'I could never marry her. But as the wife of the Emperor, I  could at least see her every now and then.'   'As a realist,' snorted the Geralt, 'you have to see that we must first find her and save. Assuming that your dreams do not lie and Ciri really still alive.'   'I know. And when we find her? What then?'   'We'll see.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"'I came to meet  you because I was ordered to go here. You have to enter that cave. I told you, the Druids  knew about you, knew about Ciri and knew of our mission. And they heard it all through the  person living in there. This person, if we believe the Druids, wants to talk to you.'   'If we believe the Druids' Geralt repeated with emphasis.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"The Swallow  is a symbol of spring, it is the saviour, the one that opens the forbidden door, to show us the  way to our salvation. It will allow the rebirth of the world. The Swallow, the Child of the  Elder Blood.'   'That means Ciri,' Geralt could not resist. 'Or her child? How?",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"However, I do not hold grudges...'   'You say that I cannot or do not want to help. How could I help you?'   Geralt thought for a moment, absolutely aware that the proper formulation of the  questions mattered a lot. 'Do I save Ciri?'   The answer came immediately. 'You will save her. Only to immediately lose her.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Nevertheless, thank you, Avallac'h'   'In a way,' the elf shrugged, 'I am interest to see what a small stone can do if it falls  between the mill stone... Is there anything else I can do for you?'   'I think not. Because I guess you can't show me where Ciri is, right?'   'Who said that?'   Geralt held his breath. Avallac'h walked briskly to the cave wall and motioned the  Geralt to follow him. 'The walls of Tir na Bea Arainne,' he said pointing to the glowing crystal, 'have unusual  properties.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"'Yennefer,' Crach said after a while. 'There are other messages that have come from the  continent. I understand that your Geralt, who stayed in Brokilon after the fight on Thanedd,  has set out from there to reach Nilfgaard and liberate Ciri.'   'I repeat, Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. And what my Geralt, as you call him, intends to do, I  do not know. But he...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Vissegerd accused both of espionage, placed them under arrest, and wanted to  put them to death, but the two prisoners escaped and rushed towards the Nilfgaardians that  Vissegerd had alleged they were plotting with.'   'Nonsense.'   'I think so too. But I'm feeling that the Geralt, contrary to what you think, is perhaps  pursuing some cunning plan. That he is going to save Ciri from the Nilfgaardian creeps...'   'Ciri is not in Nilfgaard. And Geralt does not pursue any plan. Planning is not one of his  strong points.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Uh,  it is getting cold! Soon I will have to hide the boat and pull a sled... And for the bastards in  Dun Dare, Mister Hermit, a Geralt is needed.'      ***      'He's right,' Ciri said through clenched teeth. 'He's right. It takes a Geralt...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Than a judgement hasty and unbalanced!'   'You have not found a cure for evil! And I, a Geralt brat, I found it! A reliable cure!'   He did not answer, but his face betrayed his opinion, because Ciri abruptly jumped up  from the table. 'Do you think that I am talking nonsense? That I am speaking just to speak?'   'I think,' he said quietly, 'that you speak in anger.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Goodbye, Geraltess'   'Goodbye, hermit. Thank you for everything.'   She was sitting in her saddle and about to spur Kelpie, when he came over and grabbed  her hand. 'Ciri. Stay. Wait for winter to pass...'   'I'll get to the lake before the frost.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"The old man saw her move again, fast and blurred. He saw  something glint in the light of the oil lamps. 'I'm Ciri from Kaer Morhen. I'm a Geralt. I  came here to kill.'

"Damn it! I'm freezing out  here and Schirru is surely sitting in the warmth... When I think that I myself urged that I be sent after Ciri and Schirru be sent after the  Geralt... I myself asked for it. Back then, in the beginning of September, when Yennefer fell into our hands.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"But it could not.'   Yennefer was quite enmeshed in a web of silver and copper wires, surrounded by a  scaffolding of tubes made of silver and porcelain. Tripods mounted on the chair held glass  vials that fluctuated with colourless liquids. 'I've therefore concluded' – Vilgefortz pushed another tube into her nose, this time it was  made of glass – 'that the only way to locate Ciri is an empathic probe. For this, however, I  needed someone with whom the girl had a sufficiently strong emotional connection and has  developed an empathic matrix algorithm and mutual sympathy, to borrow a neologism. I  thought of the Geralt, but he has vanished, and also Geralts are unsuitable to use as  mediums.",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"Vilgefortz turned again to the megascope, where an  image appeared on the screen, produced by the giant crystal. 'That's all she located,' he said, pointing at the screen. 'I wanted Ciri and she has given  me the Geralt. She did not have the empathic matrix of the girl, but when she became weak  she gave me Geralt's. I would not have believed she had such deep feelings for him...",The Tower of the Swallow,Ciri,Geralt
"'Such tricks will not work on me,' cried the bounty hunter, while he got the horse under  control. 'I am not scared by magic! I will catch you, Ciri! This time I will kill you,  Geraltess!

"So:  That battle took place on the last day of August during the Great War. It was fought in  Angren, on the bridge connecting the two shores of the river Yaruga near a fortress called  the Red Binduga. The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army  Corps of Lyria – led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company – myself, the writer of  these lines, the Geralt Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the  archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian  who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a  Nilfgaardian. You, reader, might be unclear on how the Queen came be alive and in Angren, as you  may have heard that she disappeared and perished along with her army when the  Nilfgaardians thrust into Lyria, Rivia and Aedirn in July, which ended with the complete  subjugation of those countries and their occupation by Imperial troops. Meve was not,  however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"The Nilfgaardians, who had fled in an unknown direction,  had lost the battle. I realize that this all sounds pretty confusing and I promise to consult a  military theorist before publishing. For now I am relying on the authority of Cahir aep  Ceallach, the only soldier in our company – and Cahir has confirmed that, from the  perspective of most military doctrines, winning a battle through the rapid escape of the  battlefield is allowed. Without a doubt, our company's part in the battle was glorious, however it had some  negative effects. Milva, who was pregnant, suffered a tragic accident.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"To me, a person who has never been guilty of anything, they tried to attach  the charge of espionage. In addition was Milva who, as it turned out, had collaborated with  the Dryads and the Scioa'tael and had been involved in the infamous massacres of people on  the edges of Brokilon Forest. On top of that was Cahir aep Ceallach, the Nilfgaardian who  was, after all, a citizen of a hostile country, and whose presence on the wrong side of the  front would not be easy to explicate and justify. As it turned out, the only member of our  company whose career was not tainted with political or criminal affairs, was a vampire. Therefore, it was sufficient that only one of us needed to be exposed and identified in order to  bring sharpened aspen stakes on all of us.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"The knight Geralt of Riva was reminded in a cold,  but firm tone of his duties to the Crown. The still-ailing Milva, the vampire Regis and the  author of these lines were advised to join the column of refugees and civilians who followed  the camp. Cahir aep Ceallach, a tall young man who looked nothing like a civilian, had a  blue and white sash tied to him and was assigned to the so-called Free Company – a cavalry  unit comprised of all sorts of scum the Lyrian Corps had picked up along the way. And so we  were separated and it looked like it our expedition had come to a definite and irrevocable  conclusion. As you can imagine, dear reader, that was by no means the end.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"So our company was on the road again, and the already lengthy list of people who had  something against us had become even longer. Geralt of Rivia, the knight without fear and  without reproach, left the ranks of knighthood before his accolade was notarized and before  the heraldic coat of arms he had devised was patented. Cahir aep Ceallach – who had  already fought with, and deserted, armies on both sides of the Great War between the  Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaard – had earned himself death sentences in absentia from  both. The rest of us were in no better positions – the noose is the noose, and it is ultimately  not a big difference, the only difference is for what – for defilement of chivalry, desertion, or  that you have given a military-mule the name of Draakula. It should not surprise you then, reader, that we displayed truly titanic efforts to increase  and maximize the distance between us and the Corps of Queen Meve.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"What we concluded was that  she really had gotten over the crisis. The third and no less strange member of our company was a Nilfgaardian, who wanted to  prove that he was not a Nilfgaardian. Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, as he claimed... ***      'Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, son of Ceallach' Dandelion said emphatically, as he aimed the  little lead pencil at the Nilfgaardian. 'I have to accept a lot of things in this highly esteemed  company that I do not like, things that I almost cannot stand.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"As fate willed it I was on the island of Thanedd during the new moon in July, when the  bloody conflict between magicians broke out. On one side were sorcerers loyal to the kings,  on the other side were traitors incited by Nilfgaard. The traitors were supported by the  Squirrels, rebellious elves – and by Cahir, son of Ceallach. Cahir had been sent to Thanedd  on a special mission – to capture and kidnap Ciri. When Ciri defended herself, she wounded  him – the sight of the scar on Cahir's hand always leaves my mouth dry.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"You can trust me on that!'   'Your Imperial Majesty' – Vattier de Rideaux cleared his throat – 'will no doubt make  the right decision after careful consideration of all the pros and cons. Both the failures and the  successes that have been reported. Your Majesty can be sure that the traitor Cahir aep  Ceallach will not escape his punishment. I've made an effort...'   'I do not pay you for efforts but for results. And they are moderate, Vattier, moderate!",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"Perhaps the real Ciri? Maybe your boss, Vilgefortz? Perhaps Cahir aep  Ceallach?'   'Halt!' The illusion of Rience raised his illusory hand. 'You've got it.'   'What I have got?'   'Cahir. We will procure the head of Cahir for you.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...'   'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier. 'Modify the sequence of names, but still...'   'As you wish. Vilgefortz – with my humble help – will procure for you the head of Cahir,  son of Ceallach. We know where he is, we can always pull him out of our sleeve, if desired.'   'You have opportunities perhaps. Please, are you telling me you have such good agents in  the army of Queen Meve?'   'You wish to test me?' Rience grimaced.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"You want his head? We can get it.'   'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened  on Thanedd.'   'That will probably be better,' replied Rience cynically. 'Why give Cahir the opportunity  to give speeches? Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor,  not to deepen it. I will procure the silent head of Cahir aep Ceallach.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"Only one thing remained to be done. 'Come, all of you.'   They came. 'Cahir, son of Ceallach' began Geralt, trying not to sound pathetic. 'I have offended you  with an unwarranted suspicion and acted maliciously towards you. First, I do hereby  apologize, head bowed.",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"I would not have believed she had such deep feelings for him... Well, I  am satisfied with what we have initially learned. The Geralt, Cahir aep Ceallach, the poet  Dandelion, and a woman? Hmmm... Who will take this job?",The Tower of the Swallow,Cahir,Ceallach
"Then on the island, he had  been very handsome. Now his face had changed, something had made him deformed and  awful. 'Excuse me, Mister Bonhart,' the sorcerer did not move from his throne-like chair, 'it is I,  the lord of castle Stygga who should assume the pleasant task of welcoming our guest, the  maiden Ciri of Cintra, Pavetta's daughter, Calanthe's granddaughter and descendant of  Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal. Be welcome. Come closer, please.'  The last words were not spoken under a mask of courtesy and ridicule.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"It was time that Duny, Prince of Maecht and false prince of Cintra, claim  his heritage. However, I had not forgotten about the prophecy. I had to go back there with  Ciri. But Calanthe was very carefully looking over my shoulder.'  'She never trusted you.'   'I know. I think she knew something about the prophecy.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"Five years ago, the blood and brains of Calanthe, the Lioness of Cintra, exploded on the flagstones of that courtyard, which I can see through this window. Calanthe whose portrait we saw proudly hanging in the foyer, the last  of the royal bloodline. After her daughter, Pavetta drowned, she was left with only her granddaughter Ciri. And if it is true that Ciri also died... 'Please,' Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart the hierarch of Novigrad, waved his trembling hand, by virtue of his age, position and widespread respect he was to preside over the discussions.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"Here in this room, after the devastation of the throne  room, a memorable conversation took place between Calanthe, the Geralt, Pavetta and an  enchanted hedgehog. Here the Queen agreed to a strange marriage. After all, the princess  was already pregnant and Ciri was born less than eight months later... Ciri, the heiress to the  throne, the young lion with the Lioness's blood... Ciri, my little sister.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"But I will not tell anyone. I'll keep this to myself and my Zuleyka,  together we can decide how we can use this knowledge the dreams have given us. That was close, she was to be my wife, this Ciri, thought Kistrin of Verden. I would have  been the prince of Cintra and heir to the throne, according to custom... I probably would  have died with Calanthe.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"At the end of a long line of dark and dusty Cintran nobles, beyond the portrait of Cerbin,  Coram and Corbett, past, Dagorad and Roegner, beyond proud Calanthe and melancholy  Pavetta, hung the last portrait. It showed the reigning Empress, the heiress of the royal blood  and the crown. A slim girl with blond hair and sad eyes in a white dress with green sleeves –  Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra and Empress of Nilfgaard. Destiny, thought Philippa Eilhart, watching Dijkstra's eyes. Poor child, thought Dijkstra, looking at the portrait.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"'Yes,' she confirmed. 'First of all you must impress prince Tancred. because you are  going to become his lover and give him a child.'   'If you were still Ciri of Cintra,' Philippa continued after a long pause, 'still the  daughter of Pavetta and granddaughter of Calanthe, you would become Prince Tancred's  legal wife. You'd be the princess and later the queen of Poviss and Kovir. Unfortunately, and  I tell you with genuine regret, fate has deprived you of everything.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Calanthe
"Ciri,  Emhyr, destiny... They are distant issues. Our concern is Menno Coehoorn the Field Marshal  of the Center Army Group.'  'Well,' sighed Zoltan Chivay. 'It seems to me that we are not going to escape a battle. Perhaps the biggest in known history.'  'Much will be decided,' muttered Dennis Cranmer.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"Mister  Cranmer... What is really happening?'  The dwarf also glanced around carefully. 'The truth,' he replied in a whisper,' is that the strength of Field Marshal Menno  Coehoorn's Center Army Group is a hundred thousand men. If there was no rebellion in   Verden, he would be here. The truth is that neither of our combined armies have enough  power to stop Coehoorn.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"Cadet Puttkammer!'  'Present!'  'To the map, please and continue. From where the lord Baron's knowledge failed.'  'As ordered! When Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn heard the reports from the secret  service confirming that the Nordling's armies were coming to aid the besieged fortress of  Mayena, he decided to make a quick march to the west. His plan was to cut off the enemy  troops and to force them into a decisive battle. For this purpose he distributed the Center  Group Army.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"From the southern shore of the lake, which the local residence called Gold, which  meandered down to the Cholta, were deployed the units of our right flank – The Volunteer  Army of Mahakam dwarves, eight squadrons of light cavalry and factions of the great  condottieri, the Free Company. The right flank was under the command of Adam Pangratt  and the dwarf Barclay Els. At a distance of nearly two miles across from the royal army, the army of Nilfgaard was  mobilized under the command of Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn. It's armed populous stood  like an iron wall, regiment after regiment, company after company, squadron after squadron,  as far as the eye could see. And through the forest of banners and halberds you could see that  their position was not only wide, but also deep.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"The morning was cloudy, but the sun pierced the clouds to explicitly remind us of the  passing hours. The wind picked up, the flags and banners fluttered like a flock of birds rising  to depart. Before us the Nilfgaardians were still, and all began to wonder why Field Marshal  Menno Coehoorn did not give the order to attack... ***    'When?' Menno Coehoorn looked up from his map and planted his eyes on his  commanders. 'You want to know when I'll give the order to attack?'  No one answered.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"For there stood the brave soldiers from Maribor, Vizima and  Tretogor and the grim landsknechts, the mercenary professionals, the cavalry did not scare. And there they fought, truly like the sea against the rocks and continued to fight, and it  was not possible to guess who would win, because even though the waves beat against the  rock, it did not weaken or disappear and it stood there between the raging waves. Like an old hawk, who knows where to fall and attack, so Field Marshal Menno  Coehoorn knew where to strike. With the iron fist of his army, which consisted of the  Deithwen division and Ard Feainn division he struck at the enemy lines above Golden Pond. That place was fiercely defended by the troops from Brugge, but they were less armed and  armoured and morale was low.",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"Then the enemy commander realised that the battle was lost. Surrounded by his loyal  officers and knights, they bought him a new horse and pleaded with him to escape and save  his life. But in the Field Marshal's chest beat a brave heart. 'It is not right,' he cried, pushing away the reins being handed to him. 'Only a coward  would flee from the field, where the empire has lost so many good men.'  Then brave Menno Coehoorn said...",The Lady of the Lake,Field,Menno
"Imperial Majesty.'  Vattier assures me that he is already on Vilgefortz's trail. That locating him will be a  matter of days, weeks at most. The heads of traitors will fall and the true Ciri, Princess of  Cintra will be delivered to Nilfgaard. And before the genuine Ciri, Princess of Cintra comes to Nilfgaard, I will have to do  something with the double. 'Lift up your head.'  She obeyed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"'We are not doing this to test your abilities as a dreamer, we are  analysing the legend. The riddles and blank spaces. It goes pretty well for us, as in the first  dream you've discovered who was the girl in the portrait, The double of Ciri who Vilgefortz  attempted to deceive Emperor Emhyr...'   She stopped because into the kitchen came the Fisher King. He bowed, muttered and  pulled out a loaf of bread, a bottle and a package wrapped in cloth from the cupboard. Then  he turned to leave, not forgetting to bow and grunt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"A  comb, and apple and a handkerchief. But...'   'Condwiramurs.'  'I'm sorry.'  'As I said, there are many versions of the flight. But it still remains unclear how Ciri went  directly from the Tower to the Swallow to Vilgefortz's castle. If you cannot dream of the  Tower of the Swallow, then try and dream of the castle. Look carefully at the tapestry...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"And  she would not eat with her hands, she was eager to show her superiority to Vilgefortz and the  rest of the guests of the sorcerer. She knew none of them. 'It is with great regret I must inform you,' said Vilgefortz, his fingers caressing the stem  of his cup, 'that Ciri, your ward, has departed from this world. You can only blame yourself,  Yennefer. And your foolish stubbornness.'  One of the guests, a short man with dark hair, sneezed loudly, wiping snot on a cambric  handkerchief.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Then they fought fiercely for the whip they both were holding. Yennefer. she said quickly,  The one whose name you've mentioned a few times to me at  night, in moments of ecstasy, has not ever betrayed you or Ciri. She was not an accomplice to  Vilgefortz. She fearlessly undertook an unprecedented risk to save Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Whole generations  will pray to me and beg me for pardon, mercy and forgiveness. Generations of whole worlds. Listen, Ciri. Do you hear those prayers? Protect us from famine, plague, fire, was and your  wrath, O Almighty Vilgefortz...'  He wiggled his fingers in front of her eyes and suddenly grabbed her face violently.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Once you have developed a placenta, I'll remove it. The rest of  my plans and intentions, as you can understand, do not concern you, so there is no use in  giving you useless information.'  He made a theatrical pause. Ciri could not stop her lips from trembling. 'And now,' the wizard gestured with a flourish, 'I invite you to your chair, princess.'  'It would be worth it,' Bonhart sneered under his grey moustache, 'to see the look on that  bitch, Yennefer's face. She deserves it.'  'Of course,' Vilgefortz wiped bubbly foam from his lips again.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"And Yennefer is something like a  mother to her. In all primitive cultures, mothers of the bride are present at this ritual. Quickly  bring Yennefer here!'  'With regard to the fertilization,' Bonhart said bending over Ciri, who the sorcerer's  minions had already started to undress, 'would it not be possible to do it the old, proven way,  Lord Vilgefortz? In accordance with nature?'  Skellen snorted and shook his head. Vilgefortz frowned.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Vilgefortz frowned. 'No,' he said frostily. 'It is not, Bonhart.'  Ciri, as if only now realising the seriousness of the situation, cried shrilly. Once, twice. 'Well, well,' the sorcerer clicked.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"'I love you too, Dad,' she said clearly. And she died. ***    Vilgefortz's shaved minions could not cope with the struggling and screaming Ciri. Some  servants had to go to their aid. One received an accurate kicked that made him recoil, knees  bent and clinging with both hands to his groin.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"'I knew that you'd come for me,' she whispered, searching with her mouth for his lips. 'That you'd come, even if...'  'Let's go,' he said after a moment, gasping for air. 'Now for Ciri.'  'Ciri,' she said and in her eyes for a brief moment blazed a fearsome purple fire. 'And  Vilgefortz.'    ***     From around a corner a mercenary crossbowman jumped out, shouted and fired. He  aimed for the sorceress.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"And you were able to confuse Vilgefortz...'  'It was my medallion.'  'Oh,' she said suspiciously. 'An interesting thing. But even so, we live thanks to Ciri.'  'What do you mean?'  'His eye. He did not regain full coordination. And often missed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"The sorcerer's name was Braathens,  which in our language is the same as the word  fried . Well, enough digression, back to the   subject at hand. After the birth of Ciri, Vilgefortz secretly visited me in Cintra. He introduced  himself as a confidant of those who remained faithful to me in Nilfgaard. He offered me his  help and soon demonstrated that he could help.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"I think she knew something about the prophecy. She would do anything to stop  me and Cintra was in her power. It was clear, I had to go back to Nilfgaard, but in a way that  no one would know that I was Duny and that Ciri was my daughter. Vilgefortz suggested a  way. Duny, Pavetta and their child were to die, disappear without a trace...'  'The faked sinking ship.'  'Right.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Duny, Pavetta and their child were to die, disappear without a trace...'  'The faked sinking ship.'  'Right. While sailing from Skellige to Cintra we had been driven by magic to the Sedna  Abyss, where Vilgefortz pulled our boat into the maelstrom. I, Pavetta and Ciri would be  close in a specially protected cabin and survive. The crew...'  'They would not survive,' finished the Geralt. 'Then began your journey over the  corpses.'  'It started a little earlier,' he said after a moment in a dully voice.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Her death,  however, was a turning point. Now is a new time and big changes are coming. You, Ciri, you  were once Princess Ciri of Cintra, but fate has now given you a different role. Surely you  already know what it is.'  'I know,' said Ciri, not listening to the warning hiss from Yennefer. 'Vilgefortz explained  it to me!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Vilgefortz
"Around Sile,  Philippa, and Sabrina Glevissig. Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety. That it was,  she admitted.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"She noticed a hint of mockery in Philippa's  black eyes. There was indignation in Triss Merigold's blue-eyed gaze. She could not decipher  the smiles of Francesca or Sile. It begins,  said Assire var Anahid, pointing to the magical image. They sat down comfortably.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"Thanks to that cream the blush on her face didn't show,  and no one could know that she was ashamed. 'Vilgefortz was hiding in castle Stygga,' Assire var Anahid confirmed. 'It is in Ebbing on  the shore of a mountain lake whose name, my informant, a common soldier, cannot  remember.'  'You used the past tense,' Francesca Findabair said. 'Correct,' Philippa took control again. 'Because Vilgefortz is dead, my dear colleague.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"From now on, my dear friends, you can stop titling me, Your Majesty, Your  Grace will be enough.'  'Elven jokes,' said Sabrina. 'I never laugh, probably because I don't understand them. What about Demavend's remaining requirements?'  Francesca blinked. 'I agree with the repatriation of the settlers and the restitution of their property,' she said  gravely. 'I guarantee equal rights for all races...'  'By the gods,' Philippa Eilhart laughed, 'don't be so accommodating!",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"I want  Dol Blathanna to be a freehold. Without the bond of vassalage, beyond the pledge of  allegiance and not to act against the sovereign.'  'Demavend will not accept this,' Philippa said laconically. 'He will not give us the profits  and revenues from the Valley of Flowers.'  'On that issue,' Francesca raised her eyebrows, 'I am willing to engage in bilateral  negotiations, I'm sure we can reach a consensus. A freehold is not required to pay tribute, but  payment is not necessarily prohibited or excluded.'  'And what about succession rights?' asked Philippa. 'What about the right of  primogeniture?",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"Not a word! Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table. Ciri was not the only one to shrink and draw he head down between  her shoulders but other magicians of the Lodge as well, with maybe the exception of  Philippa, Francesca and Assire. And Yennefer. 'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"Without a shadow of a smile. 'So,' Philippa said, 'all is taken care of.'  'No,' said Ciri. Francesca Findabair snorted quietly. Sile de Tansarville raised her head and her  expression hardened. 'I have to think about it,' Ciri said.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Philippa
"Margarita Laux-Antille wore burgundy colored satin and thick gold, without  stones. Sabrina Glevissig, on the other hand, displayed a necklace, earrings, and her beloved  finger rings - the onyx color matched her eyes and clothing. Closest to Fringilla were the two elves - Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean aep Sivney. The  Daisy of the Valley usually looked regal, but today exceptionally so. Though neither her hair  nor crimson gown displayed excessive pomp and her little tiara and necklace were made not  of rubies, but modest, yet tasteful shells.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"Around Sile,  Philippa, and Sabrina Glevissig. Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety. That it was,  she admitted.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"And a little adrenaline. Sile de Tancarville gave her a disapproving look, but said nothing. Francesca Findabair and  Ida Emean stabilized the image with spells and enlarged it so that it occupied the entire  screen. They could clearly see black peaks against the backdrop of deep blue sky, filled with  stars, which also reflected on the surface of a lake situated by a dark and edgy profile of a  castle. I am still not sure,  Sile said,  whether it was proper to transfer the management of this task  force to young Sabrina and Metz.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"Do you ladies know  what I mean? Very well. Findabair Francesca, who had been silent until then, nodded. Ida Emean, who  had also been silent, allowed a very eloquent snort. I ...",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"Sile de Tansarville,  wore a silver boa, a feminine accent to her austere black outfit. Assire var Anahid was  dressed in a violet silk dress, which was graceful and combined simplicity and modest  elegance. Francesca Findabair was majestic as ever. Ida Emean aep Sivney was mysterious as  usual. Margarita Laux-Antille was dignified and serious.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"And with her conversation with Geralt.'  'I also vote for her,' Margarita said with a smile. 'You may wonder at my motivations,  ladies, but I do it for Tissaia de Vries. If Tissaia was among us she would not agree that in   order to maintain the unity of the Lodge it is necessary to use coercive methods or restriction  of personal freedom.'  'I vote for her,' said Francesca Findabair, adjusting the lace at her neckline. 'I have many  reasons, but I do not wish to explain them.'  'I vote for her,' said Ida Emean aep Sivney. 'So my heart dictates.'  'I'm against it,' Assire var Anahid said dryly.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Ida
"A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon. The company of Geralt during a blizzard on the mountain  pass of Malheur...'  'Well done,' Nimue praised.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"Cahir also said nothing. Angouleme looked around; she had obviously not  understood much. If it is written in the books of providence , the sorceress said after a while,  that Geralt will  find Ciri, then it will happen. Regardless of whether the Geralt sets off into the mountains or  sits in Toussaint. Predestination overtakes humans.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"It will take them some time before they can get  through that door!'  'They will not waste the time, they'll seek another way,' said the black knight matter-of- factly, the frowned suddenly, seeing the blood seeping from the girl's leg. The blond waved  her hand, it was nothing. 'We have to get out of here,' the knight took off his helmet and looked at Ciri. 'I am  Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, the son of Ceallach. I came here with Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"I came here with Geralt. To rescue you, Ciri. I  know that it is unbelievable.'  'I've seen unbelievable things,' Ciri said. 'You have come a long way... Cahir...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"Go. Help Geralt...'  Cahir shook his head. 'Ciri,' he said mildly. 'I'm surprised at you. I cross the whole world to see you, and now  that I found you, to redeem myself, to save you and defend you.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"I want this  wench, I have nothing against you.'  'Strong words,' Cahir said calmly. 'Let's see what else you can do. Angouleme, Ciri,  run!'  'Cahir...'  'Go,' he said, 'help Geralt.'  They ran off. Ciri helped the limping girl. 'You asked for it,' Bonhart narrowed his pale eyes, as he did he twirled his sword.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"The first encounter convinced him that his chances were slim. The  old killer was too fast and strong. His only hope was that he rushed in order to chase Ciri, and  clearly nervous. Bonhart attacked again. Cahir parried, cut, ducked, jumped, grabbed his opponent's wrist,  pushed him to the wall and put his knee is his groin.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Cahir
"The  Duchess has palace doctors in profusion, able to cure every disease. On my honour, there is  more to discuss.'  'I am of the same opinion.' said Regis. 'Lighten up, Geralt. After all the Druidess healed  Milva...'  'And the Druidess is familiar with treatments,' Cahir interjected. 'The best example is my  own head.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"Even  though practically every throw produced the letter  S , they continued to throw. The knight poured. 'Milva, it turns out,' said the Geralt, lost in thought, 'is healthy, though she still wears a  bandage around her ribs. But she is sitting in her room refusing to exit because she does not  want to wear a bloody dress. It seemed that the conflict was going to break protocol, but the   situation was calmed by the omniscient, Regis.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"A man becomes a knight for a noble calling! Not for a monthly salary!'  'One does not exclude the other,' Regis said seriously. 'Trust me, Angouleme.'  'Trust him, Angouleme,' Geralt said drily. 'Stop running around the castle in search of  sensation, go keep Milva company. She is in a terrible mood and should not be left alone.'  'Right.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"I longed to take part in it, to eat and drink! But they sent me to the  border, to a watchtower, in the cold and grey mountains. What despair, the fate of a knight..!'  'The large and highly anticipated banquet,' Geralt said, 'was prepared with great care and  diligence. We mainly had to find Milva, who had holed up in the stables and convince her  that her attendance at the banquet was essential and depended upon the fate of Ciri and nearly   the whole world. We almost forcibly compelled her to wear women's clothes.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"'It's too bad,' she whispered, leaning towards him, 'about your tight-lipped friend. Well,  such things happen when laying out the table. Chivalry is not Baron de Trastamara strong  point.'  'Maybe it's better,' Geralt said quietly, 'a slobbery and willing courtier would have been  worse. I know Milva.'  'Are you sure?' she looked at him quickly. 'Could it be you measure her with your own  staff?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"'Hurray! Magna beast!'  'And what fucking beast is that?' Angouleme expressed her concern aloud. 'I won't eat it  until I find out what it is.'  'It's a deer,' Geralt said. 'A roast deer.'  'And not just any deer,' Milva spoke, clearing her throat. 'The deer weighs about seven  hundredweight.'  'Close.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"They are from my manor forest,  where a whole herd of them reside.'  'Oh.'  'There are among them some outstanding boars to hunt... Maybe sometime... you could  come and we can, so to speak, go hunting together...'  'But we will not be staying here long,' Milva looked pleadingly at Geralt. 'More  important tasks than hunting lie ahead.'  But when she saw how disappointed the Baron looked, she hastily added, 'Under other  circumstances, I would be happy to go hunting boars.'  The Baron immediately cheered up. 'If not for hunting,' he said elated, 'at least for a visit.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"I'm not, so to speak, an entertaining companion. I do not control courtly manners and smooth words are foreign to me...'  'I,' Milva shyly confessed, 'I was raised in the woods. I can appreciate peace and  silence.'  Fringilla found Geralt's hand under the table and held it tightly. Geralt looked into her  eyes. He could not guess what was hidden in them.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"For some reason, they were always welcome and always  found something for them in the pots, pans or grills, usually bread, bacon, cheese or maybe  pickled mushrooms. They never missed a jar or two of red or white from the famous local  vineyards. They went there every morning for the two weeks they spent in Beauclair – Geralt, Regis,  Cahir, Milva and Angouleme. Only Dandelion had breakfast elsewhere. 'He,' Angouleme slathered some bread with butter, 'has his bacon brought to him in bed!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"I've even found  myself... Fuck, what did I tell you! We have to get out of here as quickly as possible!'  'We must talk to Geralt,' muttered Milva. 'We must talk to him.'  'Yes, talk to him,' Cahir said sarcastically, 'in one of those rare moments, where he is  available. Hunting witches and monsters are the only activities that he has performed in the  last two months.'  'And you,' Angouleme snorted,' can only be caught while walking in the park playing  with the baronesses.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"The chickens, one black and the other colorful, had become so bold that they began to peck at  Milva's boots. The Archer swore and knocked them away with a powerful kick. Geralt watched her for a long time. Then he decided. Maria,  he said gravely, almost sternly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"The Baron, with the reason of youth, took her rejection to heart, was offended,  and left Beauclair immediately. Milva has been running around ever since like she was  poisoned. We've been sitting here too long,  muttered the Geralt. Too long. And who says this?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"Let's talk about it when I get back. The steward of the  Pomerol estate is expecting me. And punctuality is the courtesy of the Geralt. ***    After Milva's stormy departure, and after the Geralt had also left, the rest of the company  ate breakfast in silence. The two chickens ran around in the kitchen, one black and the other  colorful, gently scratching the floor with their clawed feet.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"They had gone into the ravine about a  quarter mile. 'They've ended,' Angouleme said, looking down at the pristine snow. 'The horse has  disappeared like in an Elvish circus.'  'What now, Geralt?' Cahir turned in his saddle. 'The tracks have disappeared. The wind  has covered them.'  'No,' disagreed Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"According to what Reynart said, real winter  and bad weather are waiting for us just beyond the pass of Malhuer. When we get there, we  will need to be at full strength. Don't just stand there, let's go.'  'But what happened to the horse?'  'What's happened to him?' muttered the Geralt. 'His footsteps have been covered by the  snow. Or maybe it wasn't a horse, but an ibex.'  Milva looked at him wryly, but refrained from making any comment.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"Milva without  thinking twice, tensed her bow and shot an arrow. Someone screamed and the door crashed  shut. Geralt heard the sound of a bolt sliding home. 'Come on, come on!' he shouted. 'There is no time to waste!'  'Geralt,' Regis said.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"From around the  gallery sounded a cry, a roar of anger, rage and horror. 'The Great Sun...' Cahir whistled. Geralt squeezed his arm. 'Let's go! Help Angouleme!'  From the gallery, a shower of arrows fell upon Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"She quietly released the bowstring. A new cry and another archer collapsed like a  puppet, spraying his fellows with brains and blood. 'Now!' Geralt cried, watching the guards flee from the gallery, and fall to the floor, taking  cover from the incoming missiles. Only the three bravest returned fire. An arrow hit the wall and dusted Milva's hair in lime  powder.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"An arrow hit the wall and dusted Milva's hair in lime  powder. The archer blew a strand of hair from her eyes and readied her bow. 'Milva,' Geralt called after Cahir and Angouleme had run to safety. 'Enough! Run!'  'Just one more,' said the archer, with the feather of the arrow at the corner of her mouth.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"It tore into her guts and severed an artery and shattered her pelvis. The archer fell  to the floor as if hit by a battering ram. Geralt and Cahir cried out with one voice. Aware that the Milva was down, the archers in  the gallery once again jumped up and fired a hail of arrows. One of the arrows hit Cahir's  helmet.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"I  have to find her as quickly as possible. I fear that Vilgefortz... Please, sir...'  'Emiel Regis.'  'Warn Geralt, good sir, that Vilgefortz is here. He is a sorcerer, a powerful sorcerer. Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless. 'Because Vilgefortz is a powerful sorcerer. She went to free Yennefer.'  Geralt cursed. 'Come on,' he shouted, to wake up the spirits of his companions. 'Let's go!'  'Let's go,' Angouleme stood up, wiping her tears.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"That he caught a glimpse of Milva's braid. He would have sworn that when he took  the sorceress to the boat, he saw Angouleme's little had holding it steady. The dwarves picked up the Geralt, Triss helped them, holding his head. Yarpen Zigrin  blinked for a second, because he saw the two Dahlberg brothers. Zoltan Chivay would have  sworn that Caleb Stratton help him lift the Geralt into the boat.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Milva
"Apparently her night ride to her meeting with Geralt at the Halfling  Hofmeier's farm.'  The next picture, a dark oil painting. A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Yennefer snorted dismissively, although inside she was boiling with rage. 'I'm sorry to spoil your good humour, my dear,' said the wizard coldly. 'Because I have  the sad news that the Geralt, Geralt of Rivia is also dead. Yes, Yes, the same Geralt Geralt,  with whom, as with Ciri, you associated your surrogate feelings, foolish, embarrassing and  nauseating to the stomach. Know Yennefer that our dear friend, the Geralt, said goodbye to  the world in a truly fiery spectacular.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Know Yennefer that our dear friend, the Geralt, said goodbye to  the world in a truly fiery spectacular. On this occasion, you should not have any remorse. For  the Geralt's death, you are not guilty to even the smallest degree. All the credit belongs to  me. Taste the candied pears, they are really delicious.'  Yennefer's violet eyes blazed with hatred.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"But then she  escaped me, the green-eyed snake.'  Yennefer imperceptibly sighed with relief  'She escaped into another world. But we will meet again, I'm sure of it. You know, witch,  the only thing I regret is that your lover, the Geralt Geralt was burned at the stake. I wanted  to give him a taste of my blade, damn mutant.'  Yennefer snorted. 'Listen, Bonhart, or whatever your name is.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Nothing from any  attempt at scanning.'  'This is bad,' said Philippa. 'We expected you to find something. Tell us, has the Geralt  calmed down, at least? Can you keep him in Toussaint until May?'  Fringilla was silent for a moment. She had not the slightest intention of telling the lodge  that during the last two weeks the Geralt had called her Yennefer twice – and at times, when  she had every right to be called by her own name.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"I will find a way with sorcery.'  'I thought,' he said, that you rely more on your friends. On Yennefer. On Geralt.'  'You know about the?' she said. 'Well, yes. You are a Knowing one!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Yennefer's dress ripples around her like seaweed. The smoke obscures the surface of the mirror, stained with fisstech. Geralt, pale as glass, his eyes closed, is still frozen under some long icicles hanging from  rocks, and will soon be buried by the blizzard. His white hair is now a mass of ice, a white  frost envelops his eyebrows, eyelashes and lips. The snow will not stop falling on Geralt, it  surrounds him covering his legs and shoulders with a soft blanket.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"I have to escape. It does not matter if those visions were true or false. On things is certain  – Yennefer and Geralt are far away in my world and my place is with them. I have to get  away, get out of here as quickly as possible. There must be some possibility.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"And I feel robbed. Robbed  of the possibility of committing follies. I cannot go madly hurrying after Ciri to help her, I  cannot run like crazy to save Geralt and Yennefer. Not only that, there is a war, which you  have sent your girls... A war, that Jarre fled to and I am refused the possibility to even stand  on a hill.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Please, sir...'  'Emiel Regis.'  'Warn Geralt, good sir, that Vilgefortz is here. He is a sorcerer, a powerful sorcerer. Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless. 'Because Vilgefortz is a powerful sorcerer. She went to free Yennefer.'  Geralt cursed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Yennefer was being dragged down the hall by a group of guards. She was ragged and  bound in chains, but it did not prevent her from putting up a fight with her captors and swear  at them like a porter. Geralt did not let them recover from their surprise. He slashed once and only once, a short  economical movement of his forearm. A guard howled like a dog, turned on the spot and  smashed his head into the plate armour statue standing in the hallway alcove; he slipped to  the ground and smeared blood over the armour.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Stay away!' he shouted. 'Or I'll slaughter her! I'm not kidding!'  'Me either,' Geralt twirled his sword and looked the man in the eye. The man could not stand it; he released Yennefer and ran back to his companions. All of  them had their hands on weapons.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"They  spread out into a semi-circular attack position. 'I knew you'd come,' Yennefer said, straightening up proudly. 'Geralt, teach these ruffians  what a sword in the hands of a Geralt can do.'  She raised her hands high, lifting the shackles. Geralt grasped Sihil in both hands, cocked  his head slightly and took aim. He slashed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Hunched as if expecting an attack from behind, but none of them looked  back. Yennefer returned to her normal size. She threw her arms around Geralt's neck. 'I knew that you'd come for me,' she whispered, searching with her mouth for his lips. 'That you'd come, even if...'  'Let's go,' he said after a moment, gasping for air.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Despite this, they went down quickly. Yennefer immediately struck one in the chest with a ball of fire. Geralt spun in a pirouette  and fell among the others, his Dwarven Sihil flashing and hissing like a snake. When four  more had fallen, then others fled, clanging and clattering along the corridors. 'All right, Yen?'  'Could not be better.'  Under the archway stood Vilgefortz.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'All right, Yen?'  'Could not be better.'  Under the archway stood Vilgefortz. 'I'm impressed,' he said quietly. 'I'm really impressed, Geralt. You are hopelessly naive  and stupid, but your technique is really impressive.'  'Your underlings,' Yennefer said calmly, 'just took off and left you. Give us Ciri and we'll  leave you alone.'  'You know, Yennefer,' sneered the wizard, 'that is the second generous offer I've had  today?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Thank you, thank you. And here is my answer...'  'Look out!' Yennefer screamed and jumped. Geralt also jumped to the side at the last  minute. A pillar of fire roared from the wizard's hands and burst through the place Geralt  stood a moment before, hissing and burning the area. The Geralt wiped soot and the charred  remains of an eyebrow from his face.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'I'm not surprised by Yennefer,' he said walking. 'She is a woman, so she is  evolutionarily lower and ruled by her hormones. But you, however, Geralt, you're not only a  man who is inherently reasonable, but a mutant, exempt from emotions...'  He gestured. Thunder. A flash.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"She felt shame. Run? Leave Geralt and Yennefer to their mercy? But common  sense told her, dead I can do nothing to help them... She concentrated, pressed her fists to her temples.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"The column broke up into three parts. It broke  from the roof and collapsed to the floor with a deafening crash. Geralt, lying flat on the floor, his head cupped in his hands, was aware of how miserable a  shield this was from the falling debris. He prepared for the worst, but nothing happened. He  jumped up and could see the glow of a magical shield around him, he realised Yennefer's  magic had saved him.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Yennefer deftly slipped  between them and retaliated with her own flash of lightning, which bounced off of the wizard  with no visible effect. He answered with a crushing blow that knocked Yennefer to the  ground. Geralt wiped the dust from his eyes and attacked. Vilgefortz turned his eyes towards him  and pointed his arm, and from his hands roared fire. The Geralt instinctively swung his  sword.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Vilgefortz yelled and  waved his arms in surprise. Yennefer freed from the spell, fell with a scream of surprise into  a pile of rubble, blood spurting from her mouth and down her chin and breasts. Geralt was already close. He raised Sihil ready to deal a blow. But Vilgefortz had no  intention of surrendering.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"He pushed the Geralt with a powerful surge of energy and  attacked the vampire with a dazzling white beam, which passed through a stone pillar like a  hot knife through butter. Regis deftly evaded the beam and returned to his usual form. He  materialised at Geralt's side. 'Be careful,' the Geralt grunted, trying to discern what was wrong with Yennefer. 'Be  careful, Regis...'  'Be careful?' said the vampire.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Geralt calmly waited with Sihil raised, ready to strike. Vilgefortz lifted his head and wailed shrilly. 'Geraaaaaalt...!'  The Geralt did not let him finish. For a long time there was silence. 'I didn't know...' Yennefer said, at last rising from the pile of rubble.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'But it's not the first I've seen.' Can you walk?'  'With your help, yes.'    ***    They met in a place where the corridors came together to form and arch. They met under  the dead eyes of the statues. 'Ciri,' the Geralt said, rubbing his eyes. 'Ciri,' Yennefer said, supported by the Geralt. 'Geralt,' Ciri said.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Geralt,' Ciri said. 'Ciri,' he answered, with a lump in his throat. 'I'm glad to see you again.'  'Lady Yennefer.'  The sorceress released herself from the Geralt's arms and straightened with a  tremendous effort. 'What a sight you are, girl,' she said sternly. 'Look at yourself and how you look.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"He felt only fatigue. And a great  desire to be done with it all. 'Mummy.'  'My daughter.'  'Let's go,' Geralt decided to interrupt, but only after a long time. Ciri sniffed noisily and wiped her nose with the back of her hand. Yennefer scolded her  with a look and rubbed one of her eyes.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Yennefer scolded her  with a look and rubbed one of her eyes. Surely she had gotten a speck of powder in them. The  Geralt watched the corridor from which Ciri emerged, as if expecting someone else to come  from there. Ciri shook her head. He understood.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Yes,' said Yennefer. 'I want to see the sky.'  'I'll never leave you again,' Ciri said dully. 'Never again.'  'Let's go,' said Geralt. 'Ciri help Yen.'  'I don't need help!'  'Let me help you, mother.'  Before them was a staircase. Bathed in smoke and at the bottom flaming torches and  braziers with fire.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"And I want to see the sky, Yen and you.'  Ciri looked at Yennefer, who if not for the railing she was leaning against, would have  fallen down. She pulled out the medallions she took from Bonhart. The cat she hung around  her neck, the wolf she gave to Geralt. 'I hope you know,' the Geralt said, 'it's just a symbol.'  'Everything is just symbols.'  She drew Swallow from its sheath. 'Come on, Geralt.'  'Let's go.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"But they did not throw down their  swords. They carefully placed them on the steps. Geralt felt the warmth from Ciri's arm and  could hear her breathing. Above, avoiding the corpses and spilled blood, came Yennefer. She showed the soldiers  her empty hands and sat down heavily on the step next to Geralt and Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"We'll he who lives by the sword... At least you spared the hangman some work. You have  travelled a long way, Geralt.'  Geralt did not respond. Ciri sniffed again and wiped her nose on the back of her hand. Yennefer again scolded her with her eyes.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Find us a discrete chamber, where I can rest and talk undisturbed with Geralt of Rivia. During that time, please provide all available services and convenience to both ladies. Obviously under the constant watch of guards.'  'As you wish, Your Majesty!'  'Geralt, follow me, please.'  The Geralt rose. He looked at Ciri and Yennefer, wanting to calm them, wanting to  warning them not to try any nonsense. But it was not needed – they were both extremely  tired.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"It is the  price I must pay and you know it.'  'I know it.'  'You can spare Yennefer's life. She does not know the secret.'  'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri. And to avenge your  death.'  'True,' said the Geralt. 'I almost forgot how much she loves the girl. You're right, Duny.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Where are you going?'  'My daughter,' Yennefer said quietly. 'This is your destiny. You'll see, it cannot be  otherwise.'  'And you?'  'Us,' Yennefer looked at Geralt, 'a different destiny awaits us. Nor can it be otherwise. Come to me, my daughter.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"This  is not fair!'  'He who lives by the sword,' Emhyr var Emreis said dully,' dies by the sword. They both  fought with me and lost. But they lose with dignity.'  Ciri, in three steps stood before him, Geralt silently gasped. He heard Yennefer sigh. Bloody hell, he thought, anyone can see it!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"When you sleep,  I'll bite through your throat...'  The Emperor with a quick gesture silenced the murmuring of his officers. 'This will happen,' he drawled, not taking his eyes from Ciri, 'as intended. Say goodbye  to your friends, Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon.'  Ciri looked at the Geralt, Geralt made a dismissive motion with his head. The girl  sighed. She hugged Yennefer and whispered together for a long time.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"He bowed his head and leaned on the  door. 'Lady Yennefer,' he finally said, an unreadable expression on his face. 'You can be sure  that I will not hurt yours and Geralt's daughter. I have trampled the corpses of people and  danced on the barrows of my enemies. I thought that was all I could look forward to.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Thank you to  you both. Goodbye.'  He walked out of the bath chamber and quietly closed the door. Geralt sighed. 'Should we undress?' he looked at the steam rising above the tub. 'I'd hate for them to  pull me out as a naked corpse...'  'I imagine it does not matter how they pull us out,' Yennefer pulled off her shoes and  socks and with quick movement began to unbutton her dress.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'I'd hate for them to  pull me out as a naked corpse...'  'I imagine it does not matter how they pull us out,' Yennefer pulled off her shoes and  socks and with quick movement began to unbutton her dress. 'Even though this is my last  hour, I will not bathe dressed.'  She pulled her shirt over her head and jumped into the tub, splashing the water. 'Well, Geralt? Why are you standing like a statue?'  'Because I had forgotten how beautiful you are.'  'You're very forgetful. Now, get in the water.'  When he sat down beside her, she immediately threw her arms around his neck.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Come, sit on the edge. I love you, but I will not, damn it, dive.'    ***    'Oh, oh...' said Yennefer tilting her head so that he wet hair arched over her back. 'Wow...'    ***     'I love you, Yen.'  'I love you too, Geralt.'  'It's time. Let's call.'  'Let's call.'  The called out. First the Geralt called and then the sorceress after him.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Each and every one of them. They took all the  prisoners, mounted their horses and left. They left no one behind.'  'They left no one?'  'Nobody.'  'Incomprehensible,' Geralt shook his head. 'I don't understand it.'  'And nothing happened,' Yennefer cleared her throat, 'to explain this?'  'No,' Ciri replied quickly, 'nothing.'  She lied. ***    At first, she had tried to appear fine.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"After advancing a few steps, she looked back for the first time, a little time later; she did  it a second time. She would never see them again anymore, she suddenly realised with  terrifying clarity. Neither Geralt nor Yennefer. Never again. That awareness, in one fell swoop wiped away her fake mask of courage.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Although it may seem like an excuse,' she said dryly, 'our activities associated with the  war and the preparation of the peace negotiations and the fact that the Lodge was not  involved with the case and final solution of Vilgefortz, have to be considered as a failure on  our part. Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Ciri, my little sister. Who is now apparently  far away to the south. Fortunately, no longer alone, she is with Geralt and Yennefer. She's  safe. Unless they have lied to me again.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"I will remember the look in their eyes. I hope that the memory of those eyes will protect me  from similar mistakes. Do you understand, Geralt?'  'I understand, Ciri,' Yennefer said. 'Both of us, we understand you very well, my dear. Let's go.'    ***    The horses ran as if carried by the wind of a magic storm.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"***    They did not realise when May came. They first noticed at night time, when they saw the  bright, distance fires of Belleteyn. When Ciri, with strange excitement jumped onto Kelpie's  back and galloped towards the fires, Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the intimate  moment. After removing the necessary clothes, they made love on a sheepskin on the ground. They  made love urgently, in silence, without words.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Please.'  The light began to throb. The horses snorted , crazed and kicked at the ground. The Geralt awoke. This time for real. ***    The next day Yennefer confirmed his fears.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"One way or another, he loved her. ***    'Now where?' Ciri asked, she had barely spoken since Yennefer had disappeared with a  flash through her portal. 'The river...' Geralt coughed, conquering the pain under his breast bone. 'The river in  front of us is called the Sansretour. We are going upstream.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"Remnants of the old bridge, black, burnt, charred piles were still visible in the water and on  the shore. Ciri began to get restless. Geralt knew why. He knew her intentions, her plans and arrangement with Yennefer. He  was ready.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
One black and white and the other black  and grey. Yennefer and Ciri. The Geralt moaned in his sleep. ***    Yennefer was right when she did not allow her to wear male clothing. Ciri would have  felt foolish dressed as a boy among these elegant ladies.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"And  when I'm done I will come back here, to Montecalvo, and come before this Lodge and  discuss what has been decided.'   Sile moved her lips, as if she had noticed a bad taste in her mouth and wanted to sit it out  immediately. But she remained silent. 'I have to meet,' continued Ciri, 'with the Geralt Geralt in the city of Rivia. I promised  that I would be there and that Yennefer would accompany me. I will fulfil my promise, with  or without your consent.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"But will not. Because you are wrong, Sabrina. This girl is a Geraltess and is trying to be smarter than us. In short, she is just trying to get away.'  'Does anyone here,' Yennefer said ominously, dragging her words, 'dare doubt the word  of my daughter?'  'Be silent, Yennefer,' Philippa hissed. 'Do not talk, or I'll lose patience.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Lady Yennefer,' Ciri whispered. 'It means...'  'Come, my daughter,' Yennefer whispered back. 'Geralt is waiting for is and it is a long  road ahead.'    ***    Geralt awoke suddenly and sat up. He heard the echoing cry of a sea eagle. Then the Geralt and the sorceress were married at a glorious wedding.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'After miraculously finding his Ciri, he allows her to leave. He leaves her alone again,  even though, as someone rightly pointed out here, it is still bad times. All of this happens to  the Geralt, because a woman wanted it. The Geralt always does what this woman wants, a  certain Yennefer of Vengerberg. If he at least got something from the sorceress in question...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"I'll no longer need it.'  'Quickly,' Yarpen said. 'Pour vodka into him, Dandelion, because he is talking like an old  Schrader when he fell into the mine shaft on his head. Geralt, I know you've a deep  temperament and a sensitive soul, but do not talk such crap, as you can see, Yennefer is not  here, just us old wolves. Don't tell us old wolves stories of a Geralt not needing a sword, the  world is not like that. You are a Geralt and you will need...'  'No, I won't,' Geralt gently denied.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'What the hell is going on?' Yennefer stood in her stirrups. 'A raid? A fire?'  'Geralt...' Ciri suddenly groaned, turning as white as paper. 'Geralt!'   'Ciri? What is the matter?'  Ciri raised her hand and the sorceresses saw blood running down her palm.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'We sent for physician,' said a dwarf standing next to Dandelion, in a husky voice,. 'but  he has not appeared...'  'it is too late for a doctor,' Triss said, surprising herself that her voice sounded so calm. 'He is dying.'  Geralt continued to stir, coughing blood, then becoming very tense and froze. Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"But now you're pathetic Yennefer. You and your magic, which is useless.'  Yennefer did not reply. She could barely hold Geralt's head in both of her hands, while  repeating a spell. In her hands, the Geralt's cheeks and forehead crackled with blue sparks. Triss know how much energy was required for that spell.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"The spell only exhausted Yennefer. Triss was  surprised that the black-haired sorceress was able to withstand for so long. Then she ceased to be surprised because Yennefer stopped in the middle of the magic  formula and fell on the pavement next to the Geralt. One of the dwarves swore again, the other bowed his head in silence. triss Merigold still  being propped up sniffed loudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Apologise to the ladies at Montecalvo, Triss,' she said. 'But it can be no other way. I  cannot stay if Geralt and Yennefer leave. I simple cannot. They must understand.'  'They must.'  'Goodbye, Triss Merigold.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"And Mistle. I was there too, and we were drinking wine and mead. And they,  Yennefer and Geralt, built a house and the live there happily ever after. Like in a fairytale. Do  you understand?'  'Why are you crying, Lady of the Lake?'  'I'm not crying, the tears in my eyes are from the wind!'  There was a long silence and they watched the sun go down over the mountain peaks.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Yennefer
"'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon. The company of Geralt during a blizzard on the mountain  pass of Malheur...'  'Well done,' Nimue praised. 'A excellent knowledge of legend. Now you know the  second reason why you are hear and not someone else.'    ***    Above the ebony table at which they sat, was dominated by a large canvas depicting a  battle scene, it seemed to be the Battle of Brenna, a key moment in the battle or a tacky scene  of a death of a hero.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"They sat together on a  bench in the steam rising from red-hot stones washed down with water, flicking themselves  with birch brushes. Salty sweat ran down into their eyes. 'If I understand correctly,' Condwiramurs wiped her face, 'the end result of my  experience on Inis Vitre should be to answer all the riddles and blank spaces in the legend of  the Sorceress and the Geralt?'  'You are correct.'  'By day, by examining images and discussions, it should prepare me for the night, when I  have the power to dream, about that event that is now completely forgotten and what really  happened? '  This time Nimue did not consider it necessary to confirm this. She got up and poured  water from a bucket onto the stones.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"What are the chances that some details  escaped the attention of historians and the researchers who fished in front of us? Do we even  have a minnow left?'   'They left,' Nimue said with conviction, combing her hair, 'Blank spaces filled with  rhetoric and fabrications. Or wrapped in silence.'  'Like what?'  'For example, the Geralt's winter stay in Toussaint. All version of the legend dispose of  this episode with a short sentence:  The heroes spent the winter in Toussaint. Even  Dandelion, who devoted two chapters to his adventures in the Duchy, is surprising enigmatic  in terms of the Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"After twelve nights on the island, Condwiramurs already had three lists of dreams. There  was a list worthy of pride, a list of  ghosts  that she had  hooked  or  anchored   successfully. Among them there was the dream of the rebellion on the Island of Thanedd and  the journey of the Geralt and his companions in a blizzard in the pass of Malheur, and the  spring downpours softening the roads in the Sudduth valley. There was also a list that Nimue  had recognised as a list of failures, dreams that despite all their efforts remained an enigma. And there was also a working list, a list of dreams waiting their turn.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"Well, thought Condwiramurs, closing her eyes. Let it be. ***     'I think I know what the Geralt did during the winter in Toussaint.'  'Well, well,' Nimue looked over the edge of the leather-bound grimoire that she was  reading. 'So you finally dreamed something?'  'Of course' Condwiramurs said boastfully, 'I dreamed! Of the Geralt Geralt and a  woman with short, black hair and green eyes.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"In the cell was a  woman, sitting with her head down, shackled and chained to a stone wall. 'They imprisoned her,' she muttered. 'while the Geralt was in Toussaint with some dark  haired lady.'  'Are you condemning him?' Nimue asked sharply. 'Without knowing practically  anything?'  'No. I'm not condemning him, but...'  'No buts about it.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Nimue
"Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted. 'Have you forgotten to do something  about that, Philippa?'  'No, I have not forgotten.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"I think that we  can agree...'  She did not finish, she glanced at all the sorceresses. One by one, they all nodded their  heads in agreement – Margarita, Triss, Assire, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and both elves. Only the second Nilfgaardian, the dark-haired Fringilla Vigo did not give an affirmative nod,  she was pale as death as she stared at Yennefer. 'So be it,' Philippa Eilhart waved her hand. 'Sit, both of you.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table. Ciri was not the only one to shrink and draw he head down between  her shoulders but other magicians of the Lodge as well, with maybe the exception of  Philippa, Francesca and Assire. And Yennefer. 'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate. But you were not right when you complained that you are  nothing.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"However, it is impossible. We know that it is impossible. So we envy Yennefer.'  'Thank you, Lady Philippa,' Ciri said after a few moments, squeezing the head of the  sphinxes in her hands. 'I also feel honoured with the proposal to take the surname de  Tansarville. However, it seems to me that my new last name is the only thing that I can  choose for myself, I thank the two mistresses.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"'Tancred Thyssen will be a fool if he does not marry her. If he instead choose another  princess, he would be a fool and blind, not to recognise the diamond among the glass beads  Yenna, I envy you. And you know how sincere I can be with my envy.'  Yennefer thanked her with a gesture. Without a shadow of a smile. 'So,' Philippa said, 'all is taken care of.'  'No,' said Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"Because you are wrong, Sabrina. This girl is a Geraltess and is trying to be smarter than us. In short, she is just trying to get away.'  'Does anyone here,' Yennefer said ominously, dragging her words, 'dare doubt the word  of my daughter?'  'Be silent, Yennefer,' Philippa hissed. 'Do not talk, or I'll lose patience. We have two  votes against.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Philippa
"The dress was seemingly randomly decorated with gold stars embroidered with tiny  cut aquamarines and mountain crystals. 'Her ladyship, the Duchess Anna Henrietta. Kneel, Sir,' said someone, whispering behind  Geralt. I wonder which one, thought Geralt, who with effort bent his sore knee in a ceremonial  bow. I'll be damned if they both don't look royal.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"It will have to be delayed a small  while, as I am saddled with state requirements. The harvest is complete and tradition requires  our participation in the feast of the vat.'  The woman in the veil at the Duchess's side leaned forward and whispered something  quickly. Anna Henrietta looked at the Geralt, smiled and licked her lips. 'It is my desire,' she raised her voice, 'that during the festival alongside Viscount Julian,  Geralt of Rivia will serve us.'  A murmur swept through the group of courtiers and knights, like the rustling of wind  through the pines. The Duchess Anarietta gave the Geralt one last glance and left the room  with her companion and retinue of pages.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"The gesture was as sincere  as it was exaggerated. It probably sounds like an absurd contradiction in terms, but trust me,  Reynart, it was precisely so.'    ***    'Oh, oh, oh,' sighed the Duchess Anna Henrietta, wringing her hands. 'Your story  distresses me, Mister Geralt. It seizes my heart with sadness.'  She sniffled her nose and reached out her hand, Dandelion at once placed a cambric  handkerchief embroidered with a monogram into it. The Duchess touched the handkerchief  lightly to her cheeks, so as not to remove her makeup.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"Are they  afraid that we will start a fight at the banquet?'  'These knives,' explained Fringilla, 'have been used in Beauclair since the days of  Princess Caroline Roberta, Anna Henrietta's grandmother. Karoberta hated when the guests  at the table picked their teeth with knives and blades with rounded tips were introduce so  there was no way of picking.'  'No way,' agreed Angouleme, smiling impishly. 'Fortunately, they gave me a fork!'   She pretended to put the fork in her mouth, but a menacing glare from Geralt stopped  her. The knight who sat to his right laughed with a vibrant falsetto. Geralt took a pot of duck in aspic and served it to Fringilla.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"The moon shone on the roofs, shining  like diamonds on the ice that hung from the eaves. Roach's horseshoes rang against the  pavement. Roach, thought the Geralt as he headed towards the palace of Beauclair, a graceful grey  mare, a gift from Anna Henrietta. And Dandelion. He urged his horse forwards.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"The poet wore a crimson beret as big as a loaf of  bread and was wearing a doublet of the same colour richly embroidered with gold thread. He   was sitting on a stool with his lute on his knees and his head was nodding carelessly in  answer to the flattery of the courtiers and ladies who circled around him. Anna Henrietta was thankfully not in sight, so Geralt unhesitatingly violated etiquette and  headed straight for him friend. Dandelion saw him coming, swelled and with an imperious  gesture said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, please leave us in private. Also the servants are allow to  leave.'  He clapped his hands and before the echo of his clap returned from the vaulted ceiling of  the hall, only the two of them stood there – and the smell of perfume, which hovered in the  air after the ladies left.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Anna
"They ride in formation, as if on parade...'  'The Free Company,' repeated the landsknecht. 'Behold, beardless yokels, those are true  soldiers. The same condottieri was present at the battle of Mayena- Adam Pangratt,  Lorenzo Molla, Frontino and Julia Abatemarco where they decided to attack and broke the  siege and liberated them from Nilfgaard's strength.'  'In combat they are unyielding as solid rock,' added the other. 'War is a craft for them,  and they provide their service for money, as you can easily deduce by their songs.'  The company approached at a walk, their singing thundering above their heads, but with a  strangely discordant note. No sceptre nor throne do we serve,  No alliances with kings,   We serve the coin, like the golden sun,  At its order, we swiftly obey!",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"Lord Constable!'  'Speak up, boy.'  'The Volunteer army and the Free Company are nearing Golden Pond... The dwarves and  the condottieri stand firm, though with severe losses. It is said that Adam  Adieu  Pangratt is  dead, Frontino is dead and Julia Abatemarco is dead... All the commanders. The Dorian  banner, which were sent to help were cut down to the man...'  'Withdrawn, Lord Constable,' Foltest said quietly but clearly.",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"But it is worth writing that this battle would  have been a small stone in the building and its importance would have been small if the fruits  of victory had not been used wisely. Constable John Natalis did not rest on his laurels, but  immediately went to the south. An unexpected counterattack led by Adam Pangratt and Julia  Abatemarco surprised two divisions of the Third Army which were running late to relieve  Coehoorn, and were routed nec nuntius cladis. At this new the rest of the Center Group Army  crossed shamefully back over the Yaruga and escaped in a hurry, and Foltest and Natalis  followed on their heels. The Imperials lost their baggage train and all their siege engines  which they planned to use to conquer Vizima, Gors Velen and Novigrad.",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"The crowd cheered, yelled, throwing hats in the air, waving  handkerchiefs, scarves and flags. 'Long like the Free Company!'  'Long live!'  'Glory to the Condottieri !'  Lorenzo Molla saluted the crowd and blew a kiss to the beautiful girls. 'If we are paid with the same enthusiasm with which we are cheered,' he shouted to be  heard above the uproar, 'then we'll be rich!'  'It's too bad,' Julia Abatemarco's throat constricted, 'that Frontino couldn't see this...'  The marched down the main street, Julia Abatemarco, Adam  Adieu  Pangratt and  Lorenzo Molla, leading a festively dressed Company, who were formed in rows of four, so  none of the horses, sleek and shiny, moved forward an inch in front of the others. The horses  of the condottieri were like their riders - calm and haughty, not frightened by the cheers and  the shouting of the crowd and the only reaction to the coins and flowers flying towards them  was to shake their heads slightly, almost imperceptibly. 'Long like the Condottieri!'  'Long live Adam  adieu  Pangratt!",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"***    'Long live the condottieri! long like Julia Abatemarco! Long live Adam Pangratt! Long  live Lorenzo Molla!'  'Long live Constable Natalis!'  'Long live our monarchs! Long live Foltest, Demavend and Henselt!'  'Long live Lord Dijkstra!'  'Long live His Holiness!' A few voices came from the crowd, obviously bribes.",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"The crowd  cheered. The Novigrad hierarch, sweating and gasping for breath like a big catfish, blessed  from the stands the burghers and soldiers, the city and the world. 'You're married, Adam Pangratt.'  'we have long lived separately. I'm getting a divorce.'  Julia Abatemarco did not answer. She turned her head.",The Lady of the Lake,Adam,Julia
"Through the mirror was revealed a  hall, in which sat a round table surrounded by women. Nine women. 'We are listening, Fringilla,' said Philippa Eilhart. 'Do you have any news?'  'Unfortunately not,' replied Fringilla. 'Nothing since the last report.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"And to take urgent steps. Philippa was - for once - not wearing any jewelry except a large cameo made of sardonyx  that was fastened to her vermilion dress. Fringilla had heard the rumors already, she knew  who had given her the cameo and whose profile it represented. Seated next to Philippa was Sile de Tancarville, in a dress of all black that sparkled with little  diamonds. Margarita Laux-Antille wore burgundy colored satin and thick gold, without  stones.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"We have enough time to pre-empt him. He cannot possibly be there before April. The nine women gathered in the great pillared hall of Castle Montecalvo nodded, looking at  Fringilla with appreciative eyes. Rhys-Rhun  repeated Philippa Eilhart while she bared her teeth in a predatory smile and  played with the sardonyx cameo pinned to her dress. Rhys-Rhun in Nazair.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"About three months Toussaint ... But it was well worth it. Fringilla Vigo let her eyes wander around the sorceresses sitting at the table. Around Sile,  Philippa, and Sabrina Glevissig. Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"Enough of that,  Margarita Laux-Antille lifted a glass of sparkling wine in the air. I suggest  we drink to the health of Miss Fringilla Vigo, through whose efforts Vilgefortz's hideout was  discovered. Really, Miss Fringilla, good work, very good work. Fringilla bowed and raised her glass in reply. She noticed a hint of mockery in Philippa's  black eyes.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"I heard neighing and galloping. I'd don't understand. Although if you  think about it...'  'Ciri.'  'What?'  'Do not think.'    ***    'Castle Stygga,' repeated Philippa Eilhart, looking out from under her long eyelashes at  Fringilla Vigo. Fringilla did not blush. IN the last three months she had been able to product a magic  cream which acted on blood vessels.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"We made a mistake. We all  do. Some more than others.'  All the sorceresses as if on command looked at Fringilla, but the cream was working  reliably. Assire var Anahid sighed. Philippa slapped her hand on the table.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"Philippa slapped her hand on the table. 'Although it may seem like an excuse,' she said dryly, 'our activities associated with the  war and the preparation of the peace negotiations and the fact that the Lodge was not  involved with the case and final solution of Vilgefortz, have to be considered as a failure on  our part. Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"I think that we  can agree...'  She did not finish, she glanced at all the sorceresses. One by one, they all nodded their  heads in agreement – Margarita, Triss, Assire, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and both elves. Only the second Nilfgaardian, the dark-haired Fringilla Vigo did not give an affirmative nod,  she was pale as death as she stared at Yennefer. 'So be it,' Philippa Eilhart waved her hand. 'Sit, both of you.",The Lady of the Lake,Fringilla,Philippa
"A castle was embedded  in the cliff that seemed to be part of the stone wall. Condwiramurs knew the castle well, she  had seen it in many illustrations. 'Vilgefortz's citadel, where he imprisoned Yennefer. Where the legend ended.'  'Yes,' Nimue said, apparently indifferent. 'That is where the legend ended, at least in the  traditional versions.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Her current cell was indeed better than the wet cell,  in which she had spent the last two months, but even so, her teeth chattered with the cold. While imprisoned she had lost track of time, they were in no hurry to inform her of the date,  but she was certain it was winter, in December, maybe January. 'Eat, Yennefer,' Vilgefortz said. 'Do not hesitate.'  The sorceress did not allow for embarrassment or accident. She ate slowly only because  her barely healed fingers were stiff and awkward and it was difficult to hold the cutlery.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"She knew none of them. 'It is with great regret I must inform you,' said Vilgefortz, his fingers caressing the stem  of his cup, 'that Ciri, your ward, has departed from this world. You can only blame yourself,  Yennefer. And your foolish stubbornness.'  One of the guests, a short man with dark hair, sneezed loudly, wiping snot on a cambric  handkerchief. His nose was red, swollen and undeniably congested.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Maybe  permanently. Vilgefortz snorted at her gesture. 'It's too late,' he said through gritted teeth, 'you have to know, Yennefer, I have enough  knowledge. And if I had this girl, I would use this knowledge. In fact, you have nothing to  regret, even though you are dry and barren as a desert, I wanted to strengthen the weak  maternal instinct and give you not only a daughter, but even a grandchild.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"For  the Geralt's death, you are not guilty to even the smallest degree. All the credit belongs to  me. Taste the candied pears, they are really delicious.'  Yennefer's violet eyes blazed with hatred. Vilgefortz laughed. 'Such is your will,' he said, 'Indeed, if not for your dimeritium bracelets, your eyes would  have burned me to ashes.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"'And my name is Stefan  Skellen. And I do not have full pants. Rather, I believe I am in a considerably better situation  that you, Lady Yennefer.'  After the speech he took a breath, coughed again and blew his nose into his soaked  handkerchief. Vilgefortz slapped the table with his opened hand. 'No more games,' Vilgefortz said, rolling his miniature macabre eye.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"The tall man with the pale eyes measured her with  anger and a sinister smile. Vilgefortz looked away. As usual, when being led from cell to cell, Yennefer tried to figure out when she was, to  get some scrap of information that could help her plan her escape. And as usual, she was  disappointed, the corridors down which she was led, had no windows, so there was no chance  to see the surrounding countryside, or at least the sin in order to determine the cardinal points. Telepathy was prevented by the two heavy bracelets and a hoop around her neck, all of  dimeritium, which effectively blocked any attempt to use magic.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Yes. To prove our trust, gentlemen, I will tell you who it is. The sorceress Yennefer, who  we've imprisoned. Imprisoned? I've heard that Yennefer worked with Vilgefortz willingly.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"She was silent for a long time. Then they fought fiercely for the whip they both were holding. Yennefer. she said quickly,  The one whose name you've mentioned a few times to me at  night, in moments of ecstasy, has not ever betrayed you or Ciri. She was not an accomplice to  Vilgefortz.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"The rest of  my plans and intentions, as you can understand, do not concern you, so there is no use in  giving you useless information.'  He made a theatrical pause. Ciri could not stop her lips from trembling. 'And now,' the wizard gestured with a flourish, 'I invite you to your chair, princess.'  'It would be worth it,' Bonhart sneered under his grey moustache, 'to see the look on that  bitch, Yennefer's face. She deserves it.'  'Of course,' Vilgefortz wiped bubbly foam from his lips again. 'Fertilization is a sacred,  noble and solemn affair, in which the family should assist.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"And Yennefer is something like a  mother to her. In all primitive cultures, mothers of the bride are present at this ritual. Quickly  bring Yennefer here!'  'With regard to the fertilization,' Bonhart said bending over Ciri, who the sorcerer's  minions had already started to undress, 'would it not be possible to do it the old, proven way,  Lord Vilgefortz? In accordance with nature?'  Skellen snorted and shook his head. Vilgefortz frowned.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"'Do not be afraid of me.'  'I'm not afraid,' she protested, bravely clenching her jaw so that he could not hear her  teeth chattering in terror. 'No, because... Because Yennefer is imprisoned somewhere here. I  have to find her as quickly as possible. I fear that Vilgefortz...",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless. 'Because Vilgefortz is a powerful sorcerer. She went to free Yennefer.'  Geralt cursed. 'Come on,' he shouted, to wake up the spirits of his companions. 'Let's go!'  'Let's go,' Angouleme stood up, wiping her tears.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"The core broke; the decorated column crashed to the floor and  crushed a terracotta mosaic. From the side flew a hissing ball of lightning. Yennefer stopped  it, uttering spells and gesturing. Vilgefortz walked towards them, his cloak billowing out behind him like dragon wings. 'I'm not surprised by Yennefer,' he said walking.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Thunder. A flash. Lightning rebounded from Yennefer's shield. 'But despite your better judgement,' continued Vilgefortz, passing fire from one hand to  another, 'you demonstrate a remarkable consistency and know nothing. You constantly want  to paddle against the current and piss into the wind.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"***    She was alone. Alone and lost in a maze of corridors. 'Lady Yennefer!'  So far she had kept silent, fearing that yelling would attract Vilgefortz's people. But  now... 'Yennefeeeeeer!'  It seemed to her that she heard something.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Geralt, lying flat on the floor, his head cupped in his hands, was aware of how miserable a  shield this was from the falling debris. He prepared for the worst, but nothing happened. He  jumped up and could see the glow of a magical shield around him, he realised Yennefer's  magic had saved him. Vilgefortz threw a bolt of lightning at the other column behind which the sorceress was  hiding. He roared furiously and a cloud of dust and smoke appeared.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"He roared furiously and a cloud of dust and smoke appeared. Yennefer deftly slipped  between them and retaliated with her own flash of lightning, which bounced off of the wizard  with no visible effect. He answered with a crushing blow that knocked Yennefer to the  ground. Geralt wiped the dust from his eyes and attacked. Vilgefortz turned his eyes towards him  and pointed his arm, and from his hands roared fire.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"He was hit by an invisible battering ram, flew backwards, fell  on the floor and slid until he found the base of a buttress. A pillar flew apart and again  tumbled from the roof. This time he did not have Yennefer's protection. The heavy carved  block struck him in the side, fortunately, not fully, but even so it hurt and completely  paralysed him. Yennefer chanted spells and threw them at Vilgefortz one after another.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"However, none  of them hit, and they all bounced harmless off of the wizard's magical shield. Vilgefortz  suddenly spread his arms wide. Yennefer wailed in pain and started rising from the ground. The wizard clapped his hands together and his fingers started to shake and if squeezing a wet  rag. The sorceress cried shrilly.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Before the sorcerer could raise a protection spell, Regis attacked his face  with his claws; he missed the eye because it was so unnaturally small. Vilgefortz yelled and  waved his arms in surprise. Yennefer freed from the spell, fell with a scream of surprise into  a pile of rubble, blood spurting from her mouth and down her chin and breasts. Geralt was already close. He raised Sihil ready to deal a blow.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Now is a new time and big changes are coming. You, Ciri, you  were once Princess Ciri of Cintra, but fate has now given you a different role. Surely you  already know what it is.'  'I know,' said Ciri, not listening to the warning hiss from Yennefer. 'Vilgefortz explained  it to me! He was going to stick a glass tube between my legs.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Vilgefortz
"Toothbrushes, for example. My private rooms, my library, my  bathroom. And the Fisher King. Please do not try and use the Fisher King.'   Condwiramurs nearly choked on her milk. Nimue's face expressed nothing whatsoever.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Gradually. And when the time comes, you'll know everything. But for now...'  She paused and looked out the window at the lake, at the black silhouette of the boat of  the Fisher King, a contrast to the shimmering, golden surface of the lake. 'For now, rest. Look around the gallery.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"'We are not doing this to test your abilities as a dreamer, we are  analysing the legend. The riddles and blank spaces. It goes pretty well for us, as in the first  dream you've discovered who was the girl in the portrait, The double of Ciri who Vilgefortz  attempted to deceive Emperor Emhyr...'   She stopped because into the kitchen came the Fisher King. He bowed, muttered and  pulled out a loaf of bread, a bottle and a package wrapped in cloth from the cupboard. Then  he turned to leave, not forgetting to bow and grunt.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"As with any person, my  dreams reflect my desire, longing... And fears.'  'I know.'    ***    The discussed until lunchtime, looking through folders and bundles of prints. The fishing  must have been good to the Fisher King because the lunch was grilled salmon. For dinner,  too. That night, Condwiramurs slept poorly.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"They ran out of the sauna, their bare feet pattering on the  boards of the landing and with a loud cry jumped into the cold water. Once they had dipped,  they swam to the landing and wrung out their hair. The Fisher King, alarmed by the splashing and yelling, looked back from his boat, he  shaded his eyes with his hand, then immediately turned around and devoted himself to his  fishing tackle. Condwiramurs considered this behaviour offensive and reprehensible. Her  opinion of the Fisher King had greatly increased when she noticed the time that he did not  spend fishing he spent reading.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"He walked with a book, even to the bathroom, and it was  nothing less than Speculum Aureum, a work both profound and intellectually challenging. So  if it was true that in her early days on Inis Vitre, Condwiramurs was somewhat astonished by  the inclinations of Nimue, they had now stopped. It was clear that the Fisher King was an  uncouth lout only in appearance. Apparently, such behaviour was considered a secure mask. Nevertheless, thought Condwiramurs, it is an unforgivable insult and an affront turning  towards this rods and bait when there were two women parading naked, with bodies worthy  of nymphs, from which the eyes should not be able to break away.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"I know all of Reverend Jarre's, various scientific treatises on the popular editions that I  will not even mention. All of these readings have left a trace, had an effect, I am not able to  eliminate this from my dreams. Is there a chance to break through the fiction to dream the  truth?'  'There is.'  'How high?'  'The same as,' Nimue nodded towards the boat on the lake, 'which the Fisher King has. You see how he tirelessly checks his hooks. They anchor weeds, roots, submerged stumps,  trunks, old shoes and the drowned devil knows what else.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
If we broke through. Have you  thought about this?'  'No. I had not thought of it.'    ***    The Fisher King had again prospered because there was lake trout for dinner again. The  fish was so delicious that the lesson went out the window. Again Condwiramurs ate too  much.,The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Different dreams. Celibacy began to be noticed. Instead of dreams of the enigma of the legend of the withcer, Condwiramurs dreamed of the   Fisher King in a variety of situations from the non-erotic to the extremely erotic. In the  extremely non-erotic dreams the Fisher King dragged her behind the boat tied to a rope. He  rowed slowly and lazily, so she sank into the lake, swallowing water and she felt a terrible  fear, because she felt something rising from the bottom, something huge and hungry,  something that wanted to swallow the bait, which she was.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"When it seemed the something  was about to catch her, the Fisher King pulled powerfully on the oars, the rope tighten and  she was pulled away from the jaws of the unseen predator. She felt like she couldn't breathe,  then she awoke. In her undoubtedly erotic dreams she was kneeling on the rickety boat, clinging to the rail  and the Fisher King held her around the neck from behind as he fucked her enthusiastically,  grunting, spitting and growling the whole time. Apart from the physical pleasure,  Condwiramurs felt an apprehension that chilled her bowels: what if Nimue caught them? Suddenly in the water of the lake she saw the wobbling, threatening face of the little  sorceress...",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"A glow. And then darkness. ***    The curses of the Fisher King, while he pulled and twisted on a rope on his boat trying to  free it from the tangled web at the bottom of the lake, broke the silence of the afternoon. The  oars, which were loose, rattled softly. Nimue coughed impatiently and Condwiramurs turned,  leaving the window and leaned back over the prints.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Here is Ciri with a unicorn on  a cliff above the sea, here on a narcotic induced landscape, and here under two moons.'  Nimue was silent. 'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides. Ciri and the unicorn in the labyrinth of worlds, Ciri and the unicorn in the abyss of  time...'  'Ciri and the unicorn,' interrupted Nimue, looking out the window at the lake, to the boat  with the Fisher King. Ciri and the unicorn appearing out of nothingness like ghosts and  hanging over a lake, a lake that unites time and places like a bridge, all the time different and  yet always the same?'  'How?'  'Phantoms,' Nimue said not looking at her. 'Visitors from other dimensions, other levels,  other places, other times.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"And you all of a sudden begin to divine. You were talking, like you saw it... in  a dream.'  The Fisher King, judging from the intensity of his voice and curses, failed to untangle the  rope, and it broke. Nimue was silent, looking at the pictures. Ciri and the Unicorn.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"It got colder. The sorceress and the adept were wrapped in furs. From the lake came the  creak of oars from the boat of the Fisher King, but they could not see it as it was hidden by  the blinding glow of sunset. 'Quite often I dream,' Condwiramurs said, 'I'm in an icy wasteland, where there is  nothing but piled of white snow and the sun sparkling on ice. And there is silence, silence  calling in my ears.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"'How long?' said Condwiramurs. 'How long do we have left, do you think? '  'A lot.'  'How much, Nimue?'  'About three thousand years.'  Somewhere on the lake, the Fisher King struck himself with the oar and cursed loudly. Nimue shook her head. Condwiramurs sighed.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Two women? ***    Condwiramurs could not stand it, she shouted with excitement and then immediately  covered her mouth with her hand. The Fisher King dropped his nets with a splash and the  swore terribly then with his mouth open he froze. Nimue did not move. On the surface of the lake, on a ray of moonlight Appeared a black horse with a rider on  her back.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Then everything disappeared. The lake was calm, the bar of moonlight settled. It was so  quiet, they thought they could hear the loud breathing of the Fisher King. Nimue refrained from tears and tightly embraced Condwiramurs. She like a little  trembling fairy.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"That Yennefer was also there with her.'  Nimue looked at the watercolour depicting a black mountain, steep and sharp as a knife,  against dark blue clouds. At the top of the hill could be seen a slender silhouette of a woman  with outstretched arms and red hair. Through the fog that covered the surface of the water came the rhythmic clatter of the  Fisher King's oars. 'If anyone was there with Triss,' said the Lady of the Lake, 'they did not survive the vision  of the artist.'    ***    'It seems that you did it,' said Yennefer. 'Watch out, Triss!'  From the black clouds over the city of Rivia fell a barrage of icy hailstones the size of  hens eggs.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,King
"Both were shrouded in long scarlet cloaks. 'Let the young come forward!'  The  young  were instructed in advance what to do. Dandelion went to the Duchess and  Geralt stepped out to meet the dark-haired companion, which he knew as Fringilla Vigo. Both women dropped their cloaks and the crowd rose in a thunderous ovation. Geralt  swallowed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Not even  jewellery. And they walked barefoot. Geralt offered Fringilla his arm, she willingly embraced him around the neck. She  smelled of roses and amber. Her body was warm and soft.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Juice spat and sprayed. The women spun around inside the vat and laughed like kids. Fringilla shot the Geralt a playful wink. 'Ho, ho!' shouted the audience. 'Let then ferment!'  Juice flowed and bubbled about the calves of the females.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"The chamberlain struck his staff on the pavement. Geralt and Dandelion approached and  help the women get out of the vat. Geralt saw Anarietta nibble on the troubadour's ear when  he lifted her in his arms. Her eyes glittered dangerously. He himself felt Fringilla's lips brush  his cheek, but could not swear whether by accident or intentionally.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Fringilla stood on the stage and wrapped herself in a scarlet cloak. The  brunette squeezed his hand strongly. 'These old traditions,' she said, 'can be exciting, right?'  'Yes.'  'Thank you, Geralt.'  'The pleasure is all mine.'  'Not all of it, I assure you.'    ***    'Pour, Reynart,'  The company at the next table performed a more festive divination – throwing a chain of  peeled apple skins and guessing there future partners from the letter it resembled. Even  though practically every throw produced the letter  S , they continued to throw. The knight poured.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"It is a  secret.'  'I understand,' gasped the fat man with excitement. 'In those circumstances... I will seat  him next to Countess Notturna, the noble and gracious aunt of the Duchess.'  'You will not regret it, neither you nor the aunt,' Geralt assured him with a straight face. 'The earl has no equal in the ways of art and conversation.'  'I am pleased to hear it. For your part, Lord of Rivia, I will sit you next to the venerable  Lady Fringilla.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"He was dressed in a black velvet jacket which made him look like a  vampire. He served the matrons with conversation and they listened fascinated. Geralt took a platter covered in a perch and parsley and offered it to Fringilla Vigo who  was sitting to his left. She wore a gown of blue satin and a gorgeous amethyst necklace. She  looked at him from under her long eyelashes, lifted her cup and smiled mysteriously.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Are they  afraid that we will start a fight at the banquet?'  'These knives,' explained Fringilla, 'have been used in Beauclair since the days of  Princess Caroline Roberta, Anna Henrietta's grandmother. Karoberta hated when the guests  at the table picked their teeth with knives and blades with rounded tips were introduce so  there was no way of picking.'  'No way,' agreed Angouleme, smiling impishly. 'Fortunately, they gave me a fork!'   She pretended to put the fork in her mouth, but a menacing glare from Geralt stopped  her. The knight who sat to his right laughed with a vibrant falsetto. Geralt took a pot of duck in aspic and served it to Fringilla.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"'I guess the reason is because you do not trust me, correct?'  'Would you like more hazel grouse?'  'I swear by the heron!' A young knight from the end of the horseshoe got up and tied a  sash around one eye that was held out by a neighbour at the table. 'I vow to not take off this  sash until all the bandits in the passage of Cervantes are killed!'  The Duchess nodded at him with her sparkling tiara. Geralt hoped Fringilla would not pursue the subject. He was wrong. 'You do not believe or trust me,' she said.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"They were the first words that he had spoken since the beginning of the banquet. Maybe it would have been the beginning of a conversation, but the archer blushed, fixed  her eyes on the tablecloth and resumed crushing her bread. But Geralt took to heart, Fringilla's words. 'Were you perhaps, Lord Baron,' he asked, 'the happy hunter, who took down this beast?'  'No,' he replied. 'My nephew, an excellent marksman.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"I'm not, so to speak, an entertaining companion. I do not control courtly manners and smooth words are foreign to me...'  'I,' Milva shyly confessed, 'I was raised in the woods. I can appreciate peace and  silence.'  Fringilla found Geralt's hand under the table and held it tightly. Geralt looked into her  eyes. He could not guess what was hidden in them.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"'With love,' Fringilla said, 'it is like nervous cramps. You cannot even be effect until they  attack, and you cannot even imagine something like that. And when you describe it, nobody  would believe it.'  'Some part does,' agreed the Geralt. 'But there are also differences. Against nervous  cramps common sense won't protect you.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"And then the celestial bodies collided and the earth moved. They fell in a pile of parchment that scattered everywhere under their weight. Geralt stuck  his nose into Fringilla's neckline. He hugged her and grabbed her knee. He rolled up her skirt  to her waist knocking over several books, including Lives of the Prophets, full of mysterious  illustrations, as well as De Haemorrhoidibus, an interesting, though controversial medical   treatise.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Whether he prefers that a woman knows what she wants, or does he like a  woman who pretends she doesn't know. And if he would be discouraged by panties that  offered resistance. The Geralt, however, seemed to show no signs of discouragement. You could say the  contrary. Seeing that it was time, Fringilla eagerly spread her legs, bringing down books and  pamphlets stacked in piles, which poured over them like an avalanche.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Seeing that it was time, Fringilla eagerly spread her legs, bringing down books and  pamphlets stacked in piles, which poured over them like an avalanche. A heavy, leather  bound copy of Mortgage Law painfully struck her in the ribs and the Codex Diphmaticus,  adorned with brass fittings, fell on Geralt's wrist. Geralt assessed and took advantage of the  situation – placing the large tome where it was necessary. Fringilla squeaked because the  fittings were cold. But only for a moment.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"But only for a moment. She gasped loudly, letting go of the Geralt's hair and throwing her hands out, grasping  both hands into the surrounding books, he left hand hold a book on geometry and her right  hold a book about reptiles and amphibians. Geralt, who held her by the hips, unwittingly  knocked over another pile of books, he was too preoccupied to worry about the pages that  rained down on them. Fringilla moaned uncontrollably, her head buried into the book Reflections on Inevitable  Death. Fringilla moaned again.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Shelves swayed and columns of books collapsed like rocks in a strong earthquake. With a  thud, from the shelf fell a first edition copy of De Larvis Scenicis et figuris comicis, followed  by a conventional and well-known book about inventory release and commands of training  troops and a book on the Heraldry of Jan de Attire adorned with the beautiful engravings. The Geralt moaned, dropping more volumes to the floor with a kick from his leg. Fringilla leaned back and cried out, hitting with her heel a pile of books. A copy of  Reflections and Meditations for Every Day of the Year, an anonymous and interesting work,  somehow appeared on Geralt's back.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Geralt read over her shoulder, finding out whether he wanted to or not, notes that had  been written by a doctor named Albertus Rivus, in a book called Academia Cintensis, printed  by the master typographer Johann Froben Junior in the second year of the reign of His  Majesty King Corbertt. Suddenly there was a silence in which only the faint sound of rustling apges could be  heard. What should I do, Fringilla wondered, lightly touching the hard edges of Geralt's side and  a copy of the Reflections on the Nature of Things. Make a suggestion? Or wait for him to  make a suggestion?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Nothing from any  attempt at scanning.'  'This is bad,' said Philippa. 'We expected you to find something. Tell us, has the Geralt  calmed down, at least? Can you keep him in Toussaint until May?'  Fringilla was silent for a moment. She had not the slightest intention of telling the lodge  that during the last two weeks the Geralt had called her Yennefer twice – and at times, when  she had every right to be called by her own name.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"If so, I wish him all the best,  said Fringilla while gnawing on a goose bone. What is up with Dandelion? the Geralt said suddenly,  I haven't seen him for so long that  I draw all my knowledge of his activities from the satirical songs they sing in the city. We know no more than you. Regis smiled with his mouth closed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"The steward of the  Pomerol estate is expecting me. And punctuality is the courtesy of the Geralt. ***    After Milva's stormy departure, and after the Geralt had also left, the rest of the company  ate breakfast in silence. The two chickens ran around in the kitchen, one black and the other  colorful, gently scratching the floor with their clawed feet. I , Angoul'me finally broke the silence, as she lifted and passed a plate of toast to Fringilla,   I have got a problem.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"You are speaking in vain. Miss Vigo will listen to you,  but she will do nothing about it. Only one thing you've said upsets her: the departure of the  Geralt. Whoa  repeated Fringilla, turning to face him and narrowing her eyes. Is that your favorite  subject to allude to, Mr.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"But  what concerns you, Angoul'me, also concerns me. So I assure you that I will discuss the  issue of leaving Toussaint with Geralt. I guarantee that the Geralt will know my opinion on  this matter. Yes, of course you will,  snorted Cahir. How did I know that you would say just that, Miss  Fringilla.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"How did I know that you would say just that, Miss  Fringilla. The sorceress looked at him for a long time. The Geralt,  she finally said,  Should not leave Toussaint. And no one who is well  disposed towards him should persuade him to leave. Where could he go that is better than  here?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"There are things between the heavens and earth that  even philosophers cannot dream of. Undoubtedly, there are such things,  Fringilla confirmed with a nod of her black-haired  head. But with regards to the fact that the Geralt is supposedly ready to leave - you must  know more than me? Because, you see, he has not mentioned any such thing to me, and he  usually tells me everything. Sure,  muttered Cahir.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"No,  the vampire said after a short silence. No, Miss Fringilla, please rest assured. The  Geralt by no means gives us more affection and confidence than you. He does not whisper  any secrets into our ears that he would hide from you. How then  - Fringilla was quiet as granite -  can you make these declarations about his  departure?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Angoul'me wiped a smudge of red beet from her nose with her  sleeve. The vampire played thoughtfully with a sausage link. Thanks to me,  Fringilla finally broke the silence,  Geralt has learned what few people know  - Ciri's family tree and the secrets of its origin. Thanks to me, he knows these things that he  had no idea about a year ago. Thanks to me he has information, and information is a weapon.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"No one spoke up. The chickens pecked at Cahir's boots, but the young Nilfgaardian ignored  them. Indeed,  he said pointedly,  none of us has given more to Geralt than you, my lady. How did I know that you would say just that? It's not about that, Miss Fringilla , the vampire began.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"***    The nine women who were seated at the large table in Castle Montecalvo stared fixedly at  Fringilla Vigo. At Fringilla, who had suddenly begun to stutter. Geralt rode on the morning of January eighth to the Pomerol estate. And he came back ... well ...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Lead me to the cellar. ***    Unfortunately, it turned out that Fringilla's amulet could not fulfill the hopes he had placed in  it. Geralt had not believed for a moment that the polished chrysoprase could replace his   silver, Geralt's wolf medallion. Fringilla had not promised anything like that at all. However, she had assured him - with great conviction - that the amulet, once attuned to the  mind of the wearer, could do different things, including warning the wearer of danger.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"It didn't. It didn't even warn him when an indistinct gray figure jumped out from a pile of slate rubble  ten steps in front of Geralt, kicked up dust with its claws and wildly wringing legs, gave a  piercing wail, ran down the tunnel whistling and giggling, and disappeared into a gaping hole  in the wall. The Geralt cursed. The magic trinket reacted to orange cats, but it didn't respond to  Gremlins. I'll have to talk with Fringilla about it, he thought as he walked towards the hole  where the little creature had disappeared.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"He spit something out, shook the dust from his hair, and  swore very blasphemously. The amulet shook incessantly, it trembled on his chest like a  sparrow inserted under his shirt. The Geralt resisted the impulse to tear it off and throw it  away into the darkness, never to seen again. First, Fringilla would have been furious. Second,  the chrysoprase was supposed to have other magical properties.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"He strained  his hearing. And his memory. ***    The Geralt's doubts concerning Fringilla's amulet were unjustified and vanished in a  moment. When he returned the great cavern and approached the stone bridge over the abyss,  the medallion began to jerk on his neck and struggle, not like a sparrow, but more like a large  and powerful bird. Let's say, a crow.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"She took off her lynx fur and laid it on a pile of straw. With a violent movement she tore  open her blouse, she wore nothing underneath. She plopped down on the fur, taking Geralt  with her. Geralt grabbed her neck, pulled up her skirt, and suddenly realized that there was no  time to take off his gloves. Fortunately, Fringilla was not wearing any gloves.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"***     Castle Rhys-Rhun, in Nazair, on the shores of Lake Muredach  Fringilla Vigo concluded  triumphantly. That is Vilgefortz's hideout. I got it out of the Geralt before he rode away. We have enough time to pre-empt him. He cannot possibly be there before April.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Well, it's all good. Wait. Geralt turned his horse, rode close to the poet, and removed a secret letter from his  jacket. See that this letter comes to the right place ... Fringilla Vigo?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"The  wizard raised the rod. His eyes burned in triumph. Geralt clenched his fist around Fringilla's medallion. The rod fell. It struck the floor, a few inches from the Geralt's head.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"'Although it may seem like an excuse,' she said dryly, 'our activities associated with the  war and the preparation of the peace negotiations and the fact that the Lodge was not  involved with the case and final solution of Vilgefortz, have to be considered as a failure on  our part. Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"Forward!'  They rode. It was the month of May. ***    'Because of you,' the Geralt said reproachfully, 'we had to run away from Toussaint like  outlaws or bandits. I did not have any time to see...'  'Fringilla Vigo? You would not have seen her.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Fringilla
"And  everything has already been described before. Vysogota of Corvo                                                                                 Chapter Five      A hot and stuffy afternoon fell on the forest, the lake's surface, until recently was dark as  polished jade, now gleamed like gold. The reflection off of the surface from the sun was so  blinding that Ciri had to shade her watery eyes with her hand. She ran through the bushes that grew on the shore and forced Kelpie into the lake, the  deep water reached above the knees of the mare. The water was so clear that, even from the  height of her saddle, Ciri could see the shadow of the horse on the colourful mosaic floor, the  seaweed and the shells.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She saw a small crab moving very quickly among the pebbles. Kelpie whinnied. Ciri jerked the reins and moved into the shallows, but not all the way to  the shore because it was sandy with many stones which would hinder fast travel. She directed  the mare closer to the edge of the water, where she could run on reasonably firm gravel. She  let the mare trot, but after a while the trot became slower.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Ha! You do not know what my mare can handle. Where are we  going?'  'Id you'll excuse me, I'll also tell you that along the way.'    ***    Ciri slowed Kelpie from her mad gallop. Avallac'h had not lied. There, in the open, in the grasslands and heaths from which  protruded menhirs, worked the same force that surround Tor Zireael.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"There, in the open, in the grasslands and heaths from which  protruded menhirs, worked the same force that surround Tor Zireael. No matter which  direction she rode or how fast, and invisible magic force pulled her back in a circle. Kelpie snorted and Ciri patted her neck, looking calm at the bunch of elves. A moment  ago, when Avallac'h finally told her what they wanted from her, she took off at a full gallop,  to get away from them, leaving them as far behind as possible. To escape them and their  arrogant and unusual request.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"In  Shaerrawedd.'  This time the elf was silent for a long while. ***    They crossed the river by a bridge, the arch looked so frail that Kelpie rebelled and  snorted when she tried to cross. Ciri was tense and restless, but carefully looked around, not wanting to miss anything,  none of the views, that the city of Tir Na Lia had to offer. Firstly, from a burning curiosity. Secondly, she had not stopped thinking about the possibility of escape and diligently kept  watch for such an occasion.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She wanted to escape questioning, curious,   intrusive elves and other their glances. Unlike any other matter they were clearly not  indifferent regarding the royal bedchamber. Elves did not know how to hide their curiosity  and Ciri had no doubt that the palace walls had ears. She found Kelpie in her stall and brought up her saddle and harness. Before she could  start saddling the mare, the little grey elves appeared two heads shorter than the Aen Elle.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The stallion screamed a hoarsely welcome, shook his head and grinned at Kelpie with  yellow teeth. Kelpie, true to the principle that there are some issues that ventilate with the  lords, not the servants, tries to put her teeth into the elf's thigh. Ciri held the reins tightly. 'Be careful,' she warned. 'Keep your distance.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The bridge would not for anything in the world, fit  two horses. One had to slow down. Ciri had no intention of slowing down. She clung to the mane and Kelpie pulled forward  like an arrow. Ciri brushed the stirrup of the elf and flew onto the bridge.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"And  now you're talking about caresses?'  Eredin approached Kelpie, rubbed and patted her neck and looked surprised to see that  the mare was dry. Kelpie abruptly withdrew her head and let out a prolonged shriek. Eredin  turned to Ciri. If he also gives me a pat, she thought, He will regret it. 'Come with me, please.'  They walked along a stream, running down a steep, densely forested slopes, that led up to  stairs made of rundown sandstone.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She could also not find Eredin. But that was quite normal – he was often out of the city  accompanied by his Dearg Ruadhri, his Red Riders. Ciri went and got Kelpie from the stables and went across the river. She was deep in  thought and took no notice to anything around her. I have to escape.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Kelpie snorted, shook her head and stamped her feet. She did not turn around, instead she  started trotting towards the hill. Ciri was stunned for a moment to the point that she did not  respond and let the mare run. Only after a while did she shout and pull on the reins. The  result was that Kelpie reared, kicked and galloped onwards.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The  result was that Kelpie reared, kicked and galloped onwards. Still in the same direction. Ciri did not try and stop her, or try and control her. She was amazed. She knew Kelpie  very well.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Kelpie slowed to a trot. She wentt up the side of the hill crowned with the cromlechs. A  league or so, Ciri thought. The magic barrier will start to work soon. The mare walked into the circle of stones, formed by a series of monoliths, fallen and  mosses, very close together, which arose thought the brambles and suddenly sank into the  ground.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The willow rustled  down by the River Easnadh. In the sky distant thunder rolled. Ciri got Kelpie from the stables. The mare knew what was expected of her and obediently  trotted towards Porphyry Bridge. Ciri stared for a moment behind her, looking at the terrace  where the boats were moored.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Not the first time. This wild ride in the dark, in the middle of the night, chased  by ghosts, spectres and apparitions. 'Forward, Kelpie!'  In the glow of the lightning, Ciri could see through her watering eyes willows and alders  along the trails. But these were not trees. They were hunched monsters coming at her from  both sides, with their twisted and gnarled limbs, rotten laughter coming from a black mouth  cavity.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"They were hunched monsters coming at her from  both sides, with their twisted and gnarled limbs, rotten laughter coming from a black mouth  cavity. Kelpie neighed shrilly and ran so fast it looked like her hooves did not touch the  ground. Ciri laid flat on the back of her neck. Not only to reduce air resistance, but also in order to  avoid the alder branches that wanted to knock her off or pull her from the saddle. The  branches whipped and beat her, catching at her clothing and hair.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
It was the voices of their pursuers. Ihuarraquax neighed. Ciri received his signal. Understood the importance. She adhered  herself to Kelpie's neck.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She adhered  herself to Kelpie's neck. She did not need to encourage her, the frightened mare ran at a  breakneck gallop. And other signal from the unicorn roughly broke into Ciri's mind. A  council or rather an order. Jump, Star Eyes.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
Kelpie snorted and  puffed. She was wet and hot. Ciri could see Ihuarraquax. He stood shaking his head and his  horn. Pawing at the ground with his hooves.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Ihuarraquax neighed again, prompting her to hurry. Kelpie replied. Ciri pulled on her  gloves. 'I'm ready.'  There was a roar in her ears. A flash.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Ihuarraquax whinnied again, urging her to hurry. Kelpie whinnied as well. Ciri pulled on  a pair of gloves. 'I'm ready,' she said. A buzz sounded in her ears.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"I know this story! When I was a child I heard this tale, from the old wandering storyteller... The Geraltess  Ciri... The scar on her cheek... The black mare, Kelpie...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The next place. ***    The place was gloomy, sinister and repulsive. Ciri involuntarily hunched in her saddle. She was shaken, both physically and mentally. Kelpie's horseshoes rang on something flat and smooth, durable and as hard as rock.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"In the literal sense!'  The unicorn snorted and shook his head, his horn moved in a short arc. The floor grating under Kelpie's hooves was rock, but a strange, and unnaturally even  which gave off an intense smell of burning ash and dirt. It took a while before Ciri realised  the maybe it was a road. She was getting the most agonizing shock with each step, therefore  she turned Kelpie towards the verge lined with something that was perhaps once trees, but  now only looked like mutilated skeletons, from which hung tattered shreds which reminded  her of the remanets of rotten shrouds. The unicorn warned her with a whinny and a mental signal.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"But it was too late. The dead trees began to slope down and ended at a deep escarpment. Ciri screamed and  kicked her heels into the mare's sides. Kelpie strained muscles were bunching up and her  hooves were crushing what was covering – or basically consisted of the slope – garbage,  mostly some weird empty containers. These containers did not crumple under the horseshoes,  but broke as if disgustingly soft, like big fish bladders.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Each of them gurgled softly and  emitted a smell that nearly knocked Ciri out of the saddle. Kelpie, neighing furiously,  stomped up the dump towards the road. Ciri, choking from the stench, clung to the mare's  neck. The made it. The hardness of the unpleasant road was greeted with an odd mixture of joy  and relief.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Above the horizon ruddy columns of smoke were rising. The unicorn snorted. Ciri wanted to rub her watery eyes on her sleeve, but found that the  entire sleeve was covered with dust. A layer of dust also covered her thighs, saddle and  Kelpie's neck and mane. The smell was unbearable.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Therefore  she quickly jumped from the wet place. Because it was also not the right place or time. ***    The next place was very warm, an intense heat prevailed there, so Ciri, Kelpie and the  unicorn dried very quickly and the water vanished off of them like vapour from a teapot. They were in a heath ravaged by the sun on the edge of a forest. The could immediately see it  was a great forest, a dense forest, wild and incredibly thick.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Down on a stony beach, Ciri could suddenly distinguish the skeleton of a giant monstrous  fish head partly buried in the gravel. The teeth that protruded from the white jaw were over  three feet in length and the jaw itself gave the sense that one could going riding through the  portal of the ribs without ever touching the head or spine. Ciri was not sure if this was her world or her time as there were fish like that there as  well. They walked along the edge of the cliff. Seagulls and albatrosses did not seem frightened  at all, they did not move out of the way, they even pecked and slashed their beaks at Kelpie   and Ihuarraquax.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Dearg Ruadhri. The Red Riders. Even before the screaming birds and the warning neigh, Ciri, Kelpie and the unicorn  turned to flee. But the air had already cracked on the other side of them and from the crack  spilled riders. The pursuers formed a semicircle around them and closed, pushing Ciri closed  to the abyss.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"They tried  to throw them around Kelpie's neck. The first loop, the mare gracefully ducked her head  under, without slowing in the least. The second loop was severed by a swing from Ciri's  sword. The mare swept between the elves like a storm. But other pursuers were already on her heels, Ciri hear their cries and the clatter of  hooves.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"I cannot let them get to me. 'Run, Kelpie!'  The black mare stretched her neck and flew like the wind. Ciri stuck to her neck to  provide the minimum of wind resistance. The shouts behind the, which only a moment before had been loud and dangerously close,  faded and were drowned out by the cries of frightened birds. Then complete silence.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Whatever you say!'  He stepped towards her, leaning on his cane. Kelpie snorted. Ciri pulled on the reins. 'She does not like strangers,' Ciri warned. 'And she bites.'  'Hey, hey.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"It's not far. Will my lady accept the invitation? Will she enjoy Gramps refreshments?'  Ciri swallowed. 'Lead on,'  Gramps turned and walked along the barely visible path, measuring the way with long  strokes from his cane. Ciri followed him, bowing her head to keep the branches from pulling  her from the saddle and keeping a firm hand on the reins to stop Kelpie from biting the old  man or eating his straw hat.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"But no fear, the old man still knows what to do. Hey, hey, and  then Gramps will eat you...'  He did not finish the sentence, he grunted and roared. Ciri felt his grip break, and broke away from him like a spring. Now she could see what  had happened. Kelpie had silently crept up from behind, grabbed Gramps in her teeth and literally lifted  him off the ground.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She pulled them up and turned, but Gramps had utilised the lost time well. With  several jumps he reached the stump and wrested the axe from it. He waved the axe, driving  Kelpie back, then with a roar, he lunged at Ciri, raising the axe to strike. 'Gramps is gonna bugger you wench!' he howled wildly. 'Even if he has to hack you to  pieces first.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"In them she heard voices,  the sound of crying children. Kelpie jumped, pulling hard on the reins and hitting her hooves hard on the cobblestones. Ciri looked down and saw dead rats. They were everywhere, some of the rodents were dead,  other writhing in pain, with pale pink legs. Something is not right, she thought, suddenly feeling panic.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
A  few steps further on lay more people. The did not move when Kelpie's horseshoes tinkled on  the pavement right next to their heads. Ciri bent so that she could pass under clothes hanging  on a clothesline. They reeked of the staleness of dirt. At the door to one of the huts was a cross painted with lime or white paint.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She screamed aloud. Trembling with fear and disgust, she became to violently wave her  arms. She startled Kelpie, who took off at a gallop, Ciri nearly fell off. Clutching the side of  the mare with her thighs she combed her fingers through her hair, ruffling it. She tore at her  jacket and shirt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"She tore at her  jacket and shirt. Kelpie continued to gallop through the smoke that blew across the street. Ciri  screamed in horror. She was going through hell, the inferno, the most terrible of nightmares. Among the  houses marked with white crosses.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"The black birds had returned and once  again settled on the broken masts, spars, bones, skulls and broken decks. The birds knew that  they did not need to worry about one lone rider. 'Easy, Kelpie,' Ciri said. 'This is the end of the road. This is the right place and the right  time.'    ***    She appeared before the walls from nowhere, as if the wind blew her from the plain of  ghostly wrecks.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"People listened as if in a trance, captivated by the emphatic words of  the storyteller who told the story of the Geralt and the sorceress. The story of the Tower of  the Swallow. Of Ciri, the Geraltess with the scarred face. Of Kelpie, the magical black mare. Of the Lady of the Lake.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"***    They did not realise when May came. They first noticed at night time, when they saw the  bright, distance fires of Belleteyn. When Ciri, with strange excitement jumped onto Kelpie's  back and galloped towards the fires, Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the intimate  moment. After removing the necessary clothes, they made love on a sheepskin on the ground. They  made love urgently, in silence, without words.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Not very well, if you're interested. But, I know the  local prince consort or candidate for consort. You also know him, Ciri.'  Ciri kicked Kelpie in the sides, making her dance in the road. 'Don't make me suffer!'  'Dandelion.'  Dandelion? With the Duchess?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"'So it's...'  'A execution,' he confirmed. 'The most popular post-war entertainment. What are the  reasons, Ciri?'  'For desertion, treason, cowardice before the enemy,' she recited fluently. 'And for  economic crimes.'  'Supplying the army with mouldy biscuits,' said the Geralt. 'During the war, an  enterprising merchant can easily get into trouble.'  'This does not look like the execution of a huckster,' Ciri pulled on Kelpie's reins,  submerging herself in the middle of the crowd, 'Look, the scaffolding is covered with cloth  and the executioner has a new, clean hood.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"My Ermine has a good heart.'  'Stop with the Ermine, dammit. You just got pardoned for insults against Her Majesty,  you don't want a recurrence.'  The troubadour was silent. Ciri stopped Kelpie and waited for them. When they arrived,  she saw Dandelion wiping tears from his eyes. 'Look at him,' she said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"We  do not have to say goodbye like it is forever. It will only be six days. Goodbye.'  'Goodbye, Ciri.'  'In Rivia, in six days,' she insisted once again, turning Kelpie about. She kicked her into a gallop and was quickly out of sight. Geralt felt as if icy claws were  clawing at his stomach.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"'We're here,' said Yennefer. 'Rivia. What a curious and entangled destiny.'  Ciri was excited and Kelpie kept dancing and shuffling on the edge of the road. Triss  Merigold sighed unnoticed. Rather, she believed it had been unnoticed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Or is it that you think because I agreed to your request that I  want to have you with us? That I was interested in seeing you spend a meeting with an old  love? Ciri, I asked you to go on ahead. The two of us need to talk!'  'It is not a discussion, it is a lecture,' Ciri dared to argue, but under the threatening glare  from violet eyes, she immediately recoiled, clucked and galloped off on Kelpie on the road  ahead. 'You're not going to meet a loved one, Triss,' Yennefer continued.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Frightened people had compacted into a crowd and she and Triss had to slow their  mounts to try and get through. Kelpie just jumped, the hooves of the horse knocking off a few  hats and caps. 'Ciri! Stop!'  Before they knew it, they were among the streets crowded with people running and  screaming. Yennefer, as she rode, saw bodies lying in gutters and noticed bodies hanging by  their legs from posts and beams.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"Where the  fires burned and murder was raging. In the next street there was fighting, dwarves and elves were fiercely defending  themselves from behind a hastily erected barricade, defending a helpless position, falling and  perishing under the pressure of the screaming mob that pounced on them. Ciri screamed and  clung to the neck of her mare. Kelpie rose into the air and jumped over the barricade, not like  a horse, but lie a huge black bird. Yennefer rain into the crowd, but pulled her horse up short, knocking over several people.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"A boat sailing on the water. The unicorn once more shook its horn and began to disappear in the white fog. 'Kelpie,' Ciri said. 'Go with him.'  Kelpie snorted. She shook her head.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Kelpie
"A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon. The company of Geralt during a blizzard on the mountain  pass of Malheur...'  'Well done,' Nimue praised.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"I devoted my life to it.'  The adept was silent and listened intently. 'Do not pretend like you did not know,' Nimue said sharply. 'Everyone knows that the  Lady of the Lake is possessed by an almost unhealthy obsession with the legend of Ciri. Everyone gossips about how it started out as a harmless hobby that gradually turned into  something like a drug addiction, or even mania. There are a lot of truth in these rumours, my  dear Condwiramurs, a lot of truth!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"An anchor, as you say.'  'I'll do it. Lady Nimue?'  'I'm listening.'  'The two portraits. These hanging side by side...Are these not Ciri?'  'There are no portraits of Ciri,' Nimue patiently repeated. 'Later artists portrayed her only  in scenes, each according to his own imagination. As for the portraits, the one on the left is a  variation on the chosen topic, it is the elf Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal, a person who the painter  could not have known.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"'...I dream images. Not scenes, no  scenes, but pictures. Ciri and a tower... A still picture.'   'And nothing more? Nothing except the visual experience?'  Nimue, of course, knew that as a capable dreamer, like Condwiramurs used all her senses,  she doesn't just receive the dream through her eyes like most people, but also through  hearing, touch, smell – and even taste.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"None of the proposed locations are convincing. We do not know and will  probably never learn what the castle looked like and where it stood.'  'But the truth...'   'The historical truth is of no importance,' Nimue sharply interrupted. 'Remember that we  do not know what Ciri really looked like. But here, in this picture drawn by Wilma Wessely,  in a violent conversation with Avallac'h set against the background of macabre statues of  children, is Ciri. There is no doubt.'  'But,' Condwiramurs did not give up, 'your tapestry...'  'Shows the castle where the legend ended.'  There was a long silence.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"'Perhaps for this part of the legend,' mused the adept, 'the historians had no objection and  just recognised it as a fictional story or a metaphor. But the artists and painters, took a liking  to this episode. Look, here is a picture with Ciri with a unicorn. Here is Ciri with a unicorn on  a cliff above the sea, here on a narcotic induced landscape, and here under two moons.'  Nimue was silent. 'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides. Ciri and the unicorn in the labyrinth of worlds, Ciri and the unicorn in the abyss of  time...'  'Ciri and the unicorn,' interrupted Nimue, looking out the window at the lake, to the boat  with the Fisher King. Ciri and the unicorn appearing out of nothingness like ghosts and  hanging over a lake, a lake that unites time and places like a bridge, all the time different and  yet always the same?'  'How?'  'Phantoms,' Nimue said not looking at her. 'Visitors from other dimensions, other levels,  other places, other times. Visions that transform one's life.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"in  a dream.'  The Fisher King, judging from the intensity of his voice and curses, failed to untangle the  rope, and it broke. Nimue was silent, looking at the pictures. Ciri and the Unicorn. 'It is true,' she said at last, 'I have seen this in my dreams. I have seen it in my dreams  many times.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"It was swollen, yes, and it hurt, but there didn't sem to be any  broken bones. When evening came, a single moon appeared in the sky. However Ciri did not want to  accept this world as her own. Or stay in in any longer than necessary. ***    'Tonight,' Nimue whispered, 'will be a good night.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"'Over there!' Nimue shouted loudly. 'This is the path that you must follow! Ciri, Pavetta's  daughter! Enter the portal, follow the path that leads to your meeting with fate! That closes  the wheel of time!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"The girl in the saddle, turned her  head, looking alternatively at them and the image produced by the tapestry and mirror. She  tossed her hair from her face, on which Condwiramurs saw the scar. 'Believe me, Ciri,' cried Nimue. 'You know me! We've seen each other once already!'  'I remember,' they heard her answer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Nimue
"Toothbrushes, for example. My private rooms, my library, my  bathroom. And the Fisher King. Please do not try and use the Fisher King.'   Condwiramurs nearly choked on her milk. Nimue's face expressed nothing whatsoever.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"The Fisher King, alarmed by the splashing and yelling, looked back from his boat, he  shaded his eyes with his hand, then immediately turned around and devoted himself to his  fishing tackle. Condwiramurs considered this behaviour offensive and reprehensible. Her  opinion of the Fisher King had greatly increased when she noticed the time that he did not  spend fishing he spent reading. He walked with a book, even to the bathroom, and it was  nothing less than Speculum Aureum, a work both profound and intellectually challenging. So  if it was true that in her early days on Inis Vitre, Condwiramurs was somewhat astonished by  the inclinations of Nimue, they had now stopped.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"I know all of Reverend Jarre's, various scientific treatises on the popular editions that I  will not even mention. All of these readings have left a trace, had an effect, I am not able to  eliminate this from my dreams. Is there a chance to break through the fiction to dream the  truth?'  'There is.'  'How high?'  'The same as,' Nimue nodded towards the boat on the lake, 'which the Fisher King has. You see how he tirelessly checks his hooks. They anchor weeds, roots, submerged stumps,  trunks, old shoes and the drowned devil knows what else.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"When it seemed the something  was about to catch her, the Fisher King pulled powerfully on the oars, the rope tighten and  she was pulled away from the jaws of the unseen predator. She felt like she couldn't breathe,  then she awoke. In her undoubtedly erotic dreams she was kneeling on the rickety boat, clinging to the rail  and the Fisher King held her around the neck from behind as he fucked her enthusiastically,  grunting, spitting and growling the whole time. Apart from the physical pleasure,  Condwiramurs felt an apprehension that chilled her bowels: what if Nimue caught them? Suddenly in the water of the lake she saw the wobbling, threatening face of the little  sorceress...",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"A glow. And then darkness. ***    The curses of the Fisher King, while he pulled and twisted on a rope on his boat trying to  free it from the tangled web at the bottom of the lake, broke the silence of the afternoon. The  oars, which were loose, rattled softly. Nimue coughed impatiently and Condwiramurs turned,  leaving the window and leaned back over the prints.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"Here is Ciri with a unicorn on  a cliff above the sea, here on a narcotic induced landscape, and here under two moons.'  Nimue was silent. 'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides. Ciri and the unicorn in the labyrinth of worlds, Ciri and the unicorn in the abyss of  time...'  'Ciri and the unicorn,' interrupted Nimue, looking out the window at the lake, to the boat  with the Fisher King. Ciri and the unicorn appearing out of nothingness like ghosts and  hanging over a lake, a lake that unites time and places like a bridge, all the time different and  yet always the same?'  'How?'  'Phantoms,' Nimue said not looking at her. 'Visitors from other dimensions, other levels,  other places, other times.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"And you all of a sudden begin to divine. You were talking, like you saw it... in  a dream.'  The Fisher King, judging from the intensity of his voice and curses, failed to untangle the  rope, and it broke. Nimue was silent, looking at the pictures. Ciri and the Unicorn.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"'How long?' said Condwiramurs. 'How long do we have left, do you think? '  'A lot.'  'How much, Nimue?'  'About three thousand years.'  Somewhere on the lake, the Fisher King struck himself with the oar and cursed loudly. Nimue shook her head. Condwiramurs sighed.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"Two women? ***    Condwiramurs could not stand it, she shouted with excitement and then immediately  covered her mouth with her hand. The Fisher King dropped his nets with a splash and the  swore terribly then with his mouth open he froze. Nimue did not move. On the surface of the lake, on a ray of moonlight Appeared a black horse with a rider on  her back.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"Then everything disappeared. The lake was calm, the bar of moonlight settled. It was so  quiet, they thought they could hear the loud breathing of the Fisher King. Nimue refrained from tears and tightly embraced Condwiramurs. She like a little  trembling fairy.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"That Yennefer was also there with her.'  Nimue looked at the watercolour depicting a black mountain, steep and sharp as a knife,  against dark blue clouds. At the top of the hill could be seen a slender silhouette of a woman  with outstretched arms and red hair. Through the fog that covered the surface of the water came the rhythmic clatter of the  Fisher King's oars. 'If anyone was there with Triss,' said the Lady of the Lake, 'they did not survive the vision  of the artist.'    ***    'It seems that you did it,' said Yennefer. 'Watch out, Triss!'  From the black clouds over the city of Rivia fell a barrage of icy hailstones the size of  hens eggs.",The Lady of the Lake,Fisher,Nimue
"None of the proposed locations are convincing. We do not know and will  probably never learn what the castle looked like and where it stood.'  'But the truth...'   'The historical truth is of no importance,' Nimue sharply interrupted. 'Remember that we  do not know what Ciri really looked like. But here, in this picture drawn by Wilma Wessely,  in a violent conversation with Avallac'h set against the background of macabre statues of  children, is Ciri. There is no doubt.'  'But,' Condwiramurs did not give up, 'your tapestry...'  'Shows the castle where the legend ended.'  There was a long silence.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"'A Knowing one. Elven wizards.'   'You could call it that. For convenience, I use an alias, Avallac'h, so you can call me  that.'  'And who told you,' Ciri frowned, 'that I have any intention of talking to you? A  Knowing one or not, you are my jailor, and I am...'  'A prisoner,' he finished sarcastically. 'You already said that.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Ha! You do not know what my mare can handle. Where are we  going?'  'Id you'll excuse me, I'll also tell you that along the way.'    ***    Ciri slowed Kelpie from her mad gallop. Avallac'h had not lied. There, in the open, in the grasslands and heaths from which  protruded menhirs, worked the same force that surround Tor Zireael.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"There, in the open, in the grasslands and heaths from which  protruded menhirs, worked the same force that surround Tor Zireael. No matter which  direction she rode or how fast, and invisible magic force pulled her back in a circle. Kelpie snorted and Ciri patted her neck, looking calm at the bunch of elves. A moment  ago, when Avallac'h finally told her what they wanted from her, she took off at a full gallop,  to get away from them, leaving them as far behind as possible. To escape them and their  arrogant and unusual request.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Avallac'h horse whinnied and nervously stamped the ground. The elf mastered it, and  shouted something back in elvish. Ciri saw one of the riders pull a bow from his saddle. She  stood up in the stirrups and shadowed her eyes with her hands. 'Stay calm.' Avallac'h said sharply.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"He stopped and whinnied  loudly, rearing. He stood on his hind legs with his front legs pawing at the air in a way no  horse would be able to do. Ciri noticed with astonishment that Avallac'h and his elves had started to softly chant  some strange, monotonous melody. Who are you? She shook her head.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"The earth  shook as the animals ran off. The elves' song stopped. Ciri saw Avallac'h wiping sweat from his forehead. The elf  looked at her out of the corner of his eye, to see if he saw it. 'Not everything here is as nice as it seems on first sight.' He said dryly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Avallac'h shouted a few words. They were in the Elvish dialect, ellyon, that she found  incomprehensible, but the command seem to be for them to grab their bows. Avallac'h turned   towards Ciri, and she felt her mind begin to hum. It was a sound quite similar to that of when  you put your ear to a sea conch. But much stronger.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
'Eredin.'  'You owe me for the help. To be paid off when requested.'  'I will pay when you ask.'  The black-haired elf jumped to the ground. Avallac'h also dismounted and motioned for  Ciri and the others to do the same. They climbed the hill between the upright stones  surrounded by bushes and blooming myrtle. Ciri eyed her companions.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Light and Dark. 'Zireael, let me introduce to you this man – Eredin Breacc Glas.'  'Nice to meet you.' The elf bowed. Ciri replied with a clumsy bow. 'How did you know,' asked Avallac'h, 'that something threatened us?'  'I didn't know,' the elf looked at Ciri intently. 'I patrol the plains, because news has  spread that the unicorns have grown restless and aggressive.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Now I know  the reason. It's because of her.'  Avallac'h did not confirm or deny. Ciri's haughty eyes meet the black-haired elf's. For a  moment, they both looked at each other, and no one wanted to be the first to look away. 'She has to be of the Elder Blood?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Am I right, Avallac'h? Who else, if not you, should know?'  Again Avallac'h remained silent. But Ciri noticed a shadow of a blush on his pale face. She was very surprised and that gave her pause. 'Generally speaking,' sneered the dark-haired elf, 'I can see something in the little  Dh'oine.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"'Generally speaking,' sneered the dark-haired elf, 'I can see something in the little  Dh'oine. I can see it and appreciate it. Like I've found a nugget of gold on a pile of manure.'  Ciri's eyes flashed angrily. Avallac'h slowly raised his head. 'You talk,' he said slowly, 'just like a human, Eredin.'   Eredin Breacc Glas smiled showing his teeth.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"'An apology for careless words. Va Faill, luned.'  He quickly left and soon the ground shook as the majority of his band left. 'Don't tell me,' Ciri snarled,' that I would have to have... to have, with him... If it is,  then never ever...'  'No,' Avallac'h said unhurried.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"If it is,  then never ever...'  'No,' Avallac'h said unhurried. 'It will not be him. Calm down.'  Ciri moved the myrtle closer to her face, so that Avallac'h would not noticed the  excitement and fascination that enveloped her.'  'I am calm.'    ***    The dry heather was replaced with lush grass, green ferns and yellow buttercups. Soon  they saw a lazily flowing river lined with poplars. The water in the river, although clean, had  a brownish colour.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"It smelled of peat. Avallac'h played on his flute a variety of lively tunes. Ciri rode frowning and thinking  hard. 'Who,' she asked, 'is to be the father of the child, for whom you care so much? Or maybe  it does not matter?'  'It is important.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Just explain some things.'  'I'm at your service. What do you want to know?'  'You know what.'  For a time they rode in silence. Ciri saw some swans floating down the river. 'The father.' Avallac'h said calmly and factually, 'will be Auberon Muircetach. Auberon  Muircetach is our...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"But when  the wind blew, the mist disappeared and moved the willow branches and wrinkled the river,  but the palaces remained. Just more beautiful. Ciri looked raptly at the wispy hanging terraces and balconies, the bridges over the river  which were hung with festoons of ivy, the stairs, balustrades, the arcades and cloisters, the  columns, the domes, and the slender asparagus-like towers. 'Tir Na Lia,' Avallac'h said quietly. The closer they move, the more fascinating the charm of the place became.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Before the porch of one of the palaces, they were met by Eredin Breacc Glas. On his  instruction small grey-clad elves ran quickly and quietly to handle their horses. Ciri watched  him in some surprise. Avallac'h, Eredin and all the elves that she had met so far were  extremely tall, so that to look them in the eye she had to bend back her head. These grey  elves were smaller than her.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"'The only thing that concerns me,' he said, 'our Swallow's eyes – twinkling like a hawk,  have not stopped glancing left and right, like a ferret looking for a hole in her cage. From  what I can see, Swallow is far from an unconditional surrender.'  Avallac'h did not say anything. Ciri, of course, said nothing as well. 'I'm not surprised,' Eredin continued. 'She could not be otherwise, since she is the blood  of Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"'Now go away and leave  me alone.'    ***    She found Avallac'h on a terrace by the river, just about to board a boat in the company  of a beautiful elf with hair the colour of straw. The elf's lips were painted a pistachio colour  and her eyelids and temples were painted with gold. Ciri was about to turn around and leave when a gesture from Avallac'h restrained her. With another gesture he invited her onto the boat. She hesitated.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Avallac'h said a few quiet words to the elf and kissed her hand. The elf  shrugged and walked away. Only once did she glance at Ciri and her eyes show exactly what  she thought of her. 'If you can, refrain from comment,' said Avallac'h as she sat on a bench in the bow. He  sat down across from her, pulled out his flute and began to play, ignoring the boat  completely..",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Indeed, only an elf  could sit in something like this and play carefree on a flute, instead of rowing and steering. Avallac'h stopped playing. 'What is it that troubles you?'  He listened to Ciri's story with a vague smile. 'You're disappointed,' he did not ask. 'Disappointed and disillusioned and above all  outraged.'  'Not at all!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"They will simply die from the cold. Those who survive will fall into barbarism,  killing each other in ruthless battles for food, they will become prey to predators mad with  hunger. Remember the text from the prophecy – The time of contempt, the Axe and the  Wolf's Blizzard.'  Ciri did not interrupt him, afraid that he would start playing the flute again. 'The child, on which so much depends,' said Avallac'h as he played with his flute, 'will  be a descendant of Lara Dorren and a carrier of the gene, a gene that was specially built by  us, it may save the inhabitants of your world. We have reason to think that the descenadant pf  Lara and your child, of course, will have abilities a thousand times more powerful than those  we have, the Knowing ones.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"We have reason to think that the descenadant pf  Lara and your child, of course, will have abilities a thousand times more powerful than those  we have, the Knowing ones. The same as you yourself possess. Do you know what I mean?'  Ciri had learned that in the Elder Speech such rhetorical figures, although seemingly  questions, do not require an answer, but simply prohibit a response. 'In short,' continued Avallac'h, 'we will have the opportunity to travel between the  worlds, and not for only a single person. We want to open Ard Gaeth – The Great Gate,  which all will pass through.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"In various,  mainly playful poses. Especially the one with which the elf was interested in – a little boy  with his mouth contorted in anger, with clenched fists, standing on one leg. Ciri stared at it for a long time, she felt a dull pain in her stomach. Only when Avallac'h  urged her, she told him everything. Fragmented and with frequent omissions.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Your ancestors stole my love from me, smug and ruthlessly took her away. But you,  are worthy to be his daughter, I will not let you take my memories of her away.'  He turned away. Ciri overcame the resistance from her squashed larynx. 'Avallac'h.'  He looked at her. 'Forgive me.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Much more reliable than  the pheromones that Avallac'h's maids blend into your perfume.'  He quickly ran his hand over the veined marble table. When he removed his hand there  was a bottle of grey-green jade. 'No,' Ciri gasped. 'I will not. Absolutely not.'  'You did not let me finish.'  'Do not take me for a fool.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"I'll tell you again – prey,  prey fervently to your human god, idols or totems. Because if it is not me, then it will be  Avallac'h and his laboratory. You cannot even imagine what it would mean for you to go  there and submit to the alternative.'  'I don't care,' Ciri said in a muffled voice, curling up on the bed. 'I agreed to everything,  just to regain my freedom. To be able to finally rid myself of you.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Avallac'h
"Upon awakening he remembered only two. In the first dream he saw the Geralt Geralt or Rivia who occasionally visited mother  Nenneke. The Geralt sat motionless under icicles hanging from an overhanging rock and  was snowed in from a blizzard. In the second dream, Ciri was hunched over a horse's neck,  galloping towards a low wall of alders. Oh yes, and just before dawn he dreamed of Triss Merigold.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"Even though this was a round table, it was known who was the boss. ***    So it was here, thought Triss Merigold, looking around the room, looking at the tapestries,  painting and numerous hunting trophies. Here in this room, after the devastation of the throne  room, a memorable conversation took place between Calanthe, the Geralt, Pavetta and an  enchanted hedgehog. Here the Queen agreed to a strange marriage. After all, the princess  was already pregnant and Ciri was born less than eight months later...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"'We sent for physician,' said a dwarf standing next to Dandelion, in a husky voice,. 'but  he has not appeared...'  'it is too late for a doctor,' Triss said, surprising herself that her voice sounded so calm. 'He is dying.'  Geralt continued to stir, coughing blood, then becoming very tense and froze. Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"But now you're pathetic Yennefer. You and your magic, which is useless.'  Yennefer did not reply. She could barely hold Geralt's head in both of her hands, while  repeating a spell. In her hands, the Geralt's cheeks and forehead crackled with blue sparks. Triss know how much energy was required for that spell.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"The spell only exhausted Yennefer. Triss was  surprised that the black-haired sorceress was able to withstand for so long. Then she ceased to be surprised because Yennefer stopped in the middle of the magic  formula and fell on the pavement next to the Geralt. One of the dwarves swore again, the other bowed his head in silence. triss Merigold still  being propped up sniffed loudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"Triss gasped loudly when she saw the girl's eyes filled with white heat and her head  enveloped in a halo. Ciri did not hear her, did not hear anyone. With one hand she touched  the unicorn's horn, with the other she touched the Geralt. From her fingers drifted a ribbon  of flickering light. No one could say how long it lasted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"That he caught a glimpse of Milva's braid. He would have sworn that when he took  the sorceress to the boat, he saw Angouleme's little had holding it steady. The dwarves picked up the Geralt, Triss helped them, holding his head. Yarpen Zigrin  blinked for a second, because he saw the two Dahlberg brothers. Zoltan Chivay would have  sworn that Caleb Stratton help him lift the Geralt into the boat.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"'Apologise to the ladies at Montecalvo, Triss,' she said. 'But it can be no other way. I  cannot stay if Geralt and Yennefer leave. I simple cannot. They must understand.'  'They must.'  'Goodbye, Triss Merigold.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Triss
"***    The leader of the horsemen was a black-haired elf sitting on a dark brown stallion, who  looked like a dragon – he was huge and had trappings embroidered with golden scales and  wearing a horned bukranion. All the other elves had black hair and red jackets under their  armour which was made of incredibly small steel rings that clung to the body like wool  knitwear. 'Avallac'h,' he saluted. 'Eredin.'  'You owe me for the help. To be paid off when requested.'  'I will pay when you ask.'  The black-haired elf jumped to the ground.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"'Zireael, let me introduce to you this man – Eredin Breacc Glas.'  'Nice to meet you.' The elf bowed. Ciri replied with a clumsy bow. 'How did you know,' asked Avallac'h, 'that something threatened us?'  'I didn't know,' the elf looked at Ciri intently. 'I patrol the plains, because news has  spread that the unicorns have grown restless and aggressive. No one knows why.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"Lara Dorren  aep Shiadhal's legacy? This is hard to believe. She looks like an ordinary small Dh'oine,  human female.'  Avallac'h remained silent. His face was impassive and indifferent. 'I assume,' Eredin continued, 'that you have made a mistake.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"I can see it and appreciate it. Like I've found a nugget of gold on a pile of manure.'  Ciri's eyes flashed angrily. Avallac'h slowly raised his head. 'You talk,' he said slowly, 'just like a human, Eredin.'   Eredin Breacc Glas smiled showing his teeth. Ciri had seen such teeth – very white, very  small, inhuman, all identical and with no canines.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"Unconditional. Otherwise it will not work. And because Tir Na Lia is  barely half a day's journey away, it is worth it to know where we stand.'  'You're too impatient,' Avallac'h curled his lips. 'What can we gain in such a hurry?'  'Eternity,' Eredin said soberly, but his strange green eyes flashed. 'But this is your  speciality, Avallac'h.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"On his  instruction small grey-clad elves ran quickly and quietly to handle their horses. Ciri watched  him in some surprise. Avallac'h, Eredin and all the elves that she had met so far were  extremely tall, so that to look them in the eye she had to bend back her head. These grey  elves were smaller than her. Some other race, she thought, a race of servants.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"He is anxious. He has demanded that the Swallow come to him  immediately, without a moment's delay. I have dissuaded him.'  Avallac'h frowned. 'Zireael,' Eredin explained, 'should appear before the king, unhurried, without pressure,  relaxed, calm and in good spirits. To ensure a good mood, a bath, new clothes, a new  hairstyle and makeup.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"Eredin flashed her a smile with his straight white teeth without canines. 'The only thing that concerns me,' he said, 'our Swallow's eyes – twinkling like a hawk,  have not stopped glancing left and right, like a ferret looking for a hole in her cage. From  what I can see, Swallow is far from an unconditional surrender.'  Avallac'h did not say anything. Ciri, of course, said nothing as well. 'I'm not surprised,' Eredin continued.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"Do not make any  attempt to try and jump. If you did, know that my Dearg Ruadhri – my Red Horsemen, are  able to cross the chasms of time and space.'  She did not really understand what he was saying. But it puzzled her that Avallac'h  suddenly scowled and frowned, clearly unhappy with Eredin's speech. As if Eredin had said  too much. 'Let's go,' he said.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"What do I care if he had impotence or is not attracted to me? Maybe he abhors Dh'oine? What if like Eredin, when he see me he see a gold nugget in a pile  of manure?'  'I hope,' Avallac'h face lost its usual calm and changed, 'you didn't tell him something  like that?'  'I did not say anything. And not for lack of desire.'  'Be careful. You do not know what you risk.'  'I do not care.",The Lady of the Lake,Avallac'h,Eredin
"Except for two. The portrait of Margarita Laux-Antille which hangs in Aretuza, on the island  of Thanedd and was by a miracle saved from fire. And a picture of Sile de Tansarville in  Ensenada in the palace of Lan Exeter.'  'And what of Francesca Findabair's image by an unknown elvish painter, hanging in the  gallery in Vengerberg?'  'A fake. When the Gate opened and the elves left, they took with them or destroyed all  their works of art and left not a single image. We do not know if the Daisy of the Valley was  really as beautiful as they say.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"Margarita Laux-Antille wore burgundy colored satin and thick gold, without  stones. Sabrina Glevissig, on the other hand, displayed a necklace, earrings, and her beloved  finger rings - the onyx color matched her eyes and clothing. Closest to Fringilla were the two elves - Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean aep Sivney. The  Daisy of the Valley usually looked regal, but today exceptionally so. Though neither her hair  nor crimson gown displayed excessive pomp and her little tiara and necklace were made not  of rubies, but modest, yet tasteful shells.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"Around Sile,  Philippa, and Sabrina Glevissig. Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety. That it was,  she admitted.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"Sile de Tansarville,  wore a silver boa, a feminine accent to her austere black outfit. Assire var Anahid was  dressed in a violet silk dress, which was graceful and combined simplicity and modest  elegance. Francesca Findabair was majestic as ever. Ida Emean aep Sivney was mysterious as  usual. Margarita Laux-Antille was dignified and serious.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"That's what we expect. We'll decide how  much we'll allow. Francesca! Speak! After all, this is about your country.'  'That is why,' said the Daisy of the Valley with a smile, 'I am silent, Sabrina.'  'Break your pride, please,' Margarita Laux-Antille asked seriously.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"And in the Marnadal  Stairs.'  'It cannot be denied,' Sile de Tansarville nodded, 'we need it. But they need Emhyr var  Emreis. And I recall that our goal is to compromise, not conflict.'  'A few days ago Shilard suggested,' recalled Francesca Findabair, 'that Cintra will be  divided with lines into two demarcation zones, a southern zone and a northern zone...'  'A foolish idea,' said Margarita Laux-Antille. 'Such a division does not have any  meaning and only becomes the seed for future conflict.'  'I believe,' said Sile, 'that Cintra should be turned into a condominium state. Administration of the territory should be engaged by both commissioners from the northern  kingdoms and the Empire of Nilfgaard.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
"And with her conversation with Geralt.'  'I also vote for her,' Margarita said with a smile. 'You may wonder at my motivations,  ladies, but I do it for Tissaia de Vries. If Tissaia was among us she would not agree that in   order to maintain the unity of the Lodge it is necessary to use coercive methods or restriction  of personal freedom.'  'I vote for her,' said Francesca Findabair, adjusting the lace at her neckline. 'I have many  reasons, but I do not wish to explain them.'  'I vote for her,' said Ida Emean aep Sivney. 'So my heart dictates.'  'I'm against it,' Assire var Anahid said dryly.",The Lady of the Lake,Francesca,Margarita
As a pledge of sincerity. Vilgefortz is  hidden at the ... ***    The Geralt sat at the opening of the tube and clenched his fists until they hurt. He strained  his hearing. And his memory.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"***     Castle Rhys-Rhun, in Nazair, on the shores of Lake Muredach  Fringilla Vigo concluded  triumphantly. That is Vilgefortz's hideout. I got it out of the Geralt before he rode away. We have enough time to pre-empt him. He cannot possibly be there before April.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Vilgefortz ... See you soon! If the Geralt gets there,  hissed Keira Metz,  he will find debris that won't even smell burnt  anymore. And neither will the dead bodies. Sabrina Glevissig smiled charmingly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"I  have to find her as quickly as possible. I fear that Vilgefortz... Please, sir...'  'Emiel Regis.'  'Warn Geralt, good sir, that Vilgefortz is here. He is a sorcerer, a powerful sorcerer. Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Geralt has to be careful.'    ***    'You have to be careful,' Regis repeated his warning, staring at Milva lying motionless. 'Because Vilgefortz is a powerful sorcerer. She went to free Yennefer.'  Geralt cursed. 'Come on,' he shouted, to wake up the spirits of his companions. 'Let's go!'  'Let's go,' Angouleme stood up, wiping her tears.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"'And  Vilgefortz.'    ***     From around a corner a mercenary crossbowman jumped out, shouted and fired. He  aimed for the sorceress. Geralt jumped as if driven by a spring and waved his sword. The  arrow deflected and flew over the head of the archer, so close that he had to duck. He did not  have time to stand again because the Geralt jumped forward and skewered him like a carp.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Despite this, they went down quickly. Yennefer immediately struck one in the chest with a ball of fire. Geralt spun in a pirouette  and fell among the others, his Dwarven Sihil flashing and hissing like a snake. When four  more had fallen, then others fled, clanging and clattering along the corridors. 'All right, Yen?'  'Could not be better.'  Under the archway stood Vilgefortz.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"'All right, Yen?'  'Could not be better.'  Under the archway stood Vilgefortz. 'I'm impressed,' he said quietly. 'I'm really impressed, Geralt. You are hopelessly naive  and stupid, but your technique is really impressive.'  'Your underlings,' Yennefer said calmly, 'just took off and left you. Give us Ciri and we'll  leave you alone.'  'You know, Yennefer,' sneered the wizard, 'that is the second generous offer I've had  today?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"And here is my answer...'  'Look out!' Yennefer screamed and jumped. Geralt also jumped to the side at the last  minute. A pillar of fire roared from the wizard's hands and burst through the place Geralt  stood a moment before, hissing and burning the area. The Geralt wiped soot and the charred  remains of an eyebrow from his face. He saw Vilgefortz again raise his hand.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Yennefer deftly slipped  between them and retaliated with her own flash of lightning, which bounced off of the wizard  with no visible effect. He answered with a crushing blow that knocked Yennefer to the  ground. Geralt wiped the dust from his eyes and attacked. Vilgefortz turned his eyes towards him  and pointed his arm, and from his hands roared fire. The Geralt instinctively swung his  sword.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"The dwarven blade, covered with runes, shielded him and but the stream of fire in  half. 'Ha!' roared Vilgefortz. 'Impressive, Geralt! What do you say to this!'  The Geralt said nothing. He was hit by an invisible battering ram, flew backwards, fell  on the floor and slid until he found the base of a buttress.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
The sorceress cried shrilly. And started to squirm. Geralt clenched his teeth in pain and rose to return to the fight. But he was overtaken by  Regis. The vampire came flying from out of nowhere in the shape of a giant bat and rushed at  Vilgefortz quietly.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Vilgefortz yelled and  waved his arms in surprise. Yennefer freed from the spell, fell with a scream of surprise into  a pile of rubble, blood spurting from her mouth and down her chin and breasts. Geralt was already close. He raised Sihil ready to deal a blow. But Vilgefortz had no  intention of surrendering.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Vilgefortz pushed the vampire into a column, with both of  his hands burning with white fire. Regis screamed. He screamed so loud that the Geralt had to cover his ears with his hands. The remains of  the windows shattered noisily. The column simply melted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"He jumped forward and swung Sihil. The wizard  turned and hit him with magical energy. The Geralt flew the entire length of the hall, hit a  wall on the other side and slid down it. He lay there gasping for air, like a fish out of water, wondering not what was broken, but  what was whole. Vilgefortz walked towards him.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
Both opponents dodged  around each other in a deadly dance. The rod flicked like lightning. Geralt managed to parry  the hammering blow. Vilgefortz skilfully deflected. Each time steel meet steel it groaned  pitifully.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Geralt clenched his fist around Fringilla's medallion. The rod fell. It struck the floor, a few inches from the Geralt's head. Geralt rolled to the  side and quickly got up on one knee. Vilgefortz jumped after him and swung again.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"His eyes twinkled and he leapt and swung his magical weapon. But it was too late. Geralt quickly slashed him across the stomach. Vilgefortz screamed, dropped the rod and  took a few steps backwards. The Geralt followed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"He lowered his head and look at his chest and  abdomen. For a long time he could not look away from what he saw. Geralt calmly waited with Sihil raised, ready to strike. Vilgefortz lifted his head and wailed shrilly. 'Geraaaaaalt...!'  The Geralt did not let him finish.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"She looked pitiful. Blood smeared her chin and chest. 'I didn't know,' she repeated, meeting Geralt's puzzled gaze, 'that you knew how to cast  spells of illusion. And you were able to confuse Vilgefortz...'  'It was my medallion.'  'Oh,' she said suspiciously. 'An interesting thing.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
The blood on her sleeve and hands. The white streaks in her hair. Then he turned his eyes to the Geralt. 'Vilgefortz?' he asked in a sonorous voice. Geralt shook his head.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"While sailing from Skellige to Cintra we had been driven by magic to the Sedna  Abyss, where Vilgefortz pulled our boat into the maelstrom. I, Pavetta and Ciri would be  close in a specially protected cabin and survive. The crew...'  'They would not survive,' finished the Geralt. 'Then began your journey over the  corpses.'  'It started a little earlier,' he said after a moment in a dully voice. 'When it became clear  that Ciri was not on board.'  Geralt raised his eyebrows.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"'Because Vilgefortz is dead, my dear colleague. He  and his companions are dead. This service was provided by our good friend the Geralt  Geralt of Rivia. Obviously we underestimated him. We all do.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"'Although it may seem like an excuse,' she said dryly, 'our activities associated with the  war and the preparation of the peace negotiations and the fact that the Lodge was not  involved with the case and final solution of Vilgefortz, have to be considered as a failure on  our part. Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"Only now I know what his smile meant. It was a  sympathetic smile at the naivety of a child who believed that killing Vilgefortz and Bonhart  represented the triumph of good over evil. have to try and convince Geralt that what you  ladies want to do with me, differs substantially from what Vilgefortz wanted to do with his  glass tube. I'll try and explain to him the differences between castle Montecalvo and castle  Stygga, although Vilgefortz thought he was doing was for the good of the world and you  ladies also do for the good of the world. I know it is not going to be easy to convince as old  wolf like Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Vilgefortz
"'Ciri... Hmmm... Apparently her night ride to her meeting with Geralt at the Halfling  Hofmeier's farm.'  The next picture, a dark oil painting. A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"The  Duchess has palace doctors in profusion, able to cure every disease. On my honour, there is  more to discuss.'  'I am of the same opinion.' said Regis. 'Lighten up, Geralt. After all the Druidess healed  Milva...'  'And the Druidess is familiar with treatments,' Cahir interjected. 'The best example is my  own head.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"'Fortunately, they gave me a fork!'   She pretended to put the fork in her mouth, but a menacing glare from Geralt stopped  her. The knight who sat to his right laughed with a vibrant falsetto. Geralt took a pot of duck in aspic and served it to Fringilla. He saw two young  Baronesses religiously looking at Cahir, and how he honestly tried to divide among them  equally his attention. He saw the young knights bustle around Angouleme, getting her food  and laughing at her silly jokes.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"The Baronesses whose names were Queline and Nique, listened to Cahir with open  mouths, wide eyes and burning cheeks. At the head of the banquet table could be hear Regis  and the higher aristocracy. For Geralt – even with his Geralt hearing – could only make out  a few buzz words here and there, but they seemed to be talking about ghosts, strigas, succubi  and vampires. Regis gesticulated with a silver fork and argued the best remedy for vampires  are silver, whose lightest touch is absolutely deadly to a vampire. What about garlic?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"For some reason, they were always welcome and always  found something for them in the pots, pans or grills, usually bread, bacon, cheese or maybe  pickled mushrooms. They never missed a jar or two of red or white from the famous local  vineyards. They went there every morning for the two weeks they spent in Beauclair – Geralt, Regis,  Cahir, Milva and Angouleme. Only Dandelion had breakfast elsewhere. 'He,' Angouleme slathered some bread with butter, 'has his bacon brought to him in bed!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"I've even found  myself... Fuck, what did I tell you! We have to get out of here as quickly as possible!'  'We must talk to Geralt,' muttered Milva. 'We must talk to him.'  'Yes, talk to him,' Cahir said sarcastically, 'in one of those rare moments, where he is  available. Hunting witches and monsters are the only activities that he has performed in the  last two months.'  'And you,' Angouleme snorted,' can only be caught while walking in the park playing  with the baronesses.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Too long, I tell you, sitting here in idleness. Fooling  around.'  'Nicely put,' said Cahir. 'Very nice.'  Geralt carefully moved away. As noiselessly as a bat. ***    Quickly and silently he walked down the corridors.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Assuming, of course, that you had me in mind. But  what concerns you, Angoul'me, also concerns me. So I assure you that I will discuss the  issue of leaving Toussaint with Geralt. I guarantee that the Geralt will know my opinion on  this matter. Yes, of course you will,  snorted Cahir.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"There are things between the heavens and earth that  even philosophers cannot dream of. Undoubtedly, there are such things,  Fringilla confirmed with a nod of her black-haired  head. But with regards to the fact that the Geralt is supposedly ready to leave - you must  know more than me? Because, you see, he has not mentioned any such thing to me, and he  usually tells me everything. Sure,  muttered Cahir.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"No one spoke up. The chickens pecked at Cahir's boots, but the young Nilfgaardian ignored  them. Indeed,  he said pointedly,  none of us has given more to Geralt than you, my lady. How did I know that you would say just that? It's not about that, Miss Fringilla , the vampire began.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Cahir also said nothing. Angouleme looked around; she had obviously not  understood much. If it is written in the books of providence , the sorceress said after a while,  that Geralt will  find Ciri, then it will happen. Regardless of whether the Geralt sets off into the mountains or  sits in Toussaint. Predestination overtakes humans.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"I'll be done in half an hour! Me too. Cahir let his spoon fall, stood up, and looked at the Geralt carefully. But I'd like  to know what this is. A whim?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"'Look there! There are hoof prints. Someone was here!'  'What did you say?' Geralt moved the scarf which he had around his head to avoid his  ears freezing. 'What, Angouleme?'  'Footprints! Hoof prints!'  'Who could bring a horse here?' Cahir also had to scream above the river Sansretour,  which thundered and echoed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"They had gone into the ravine about a  quarter mile. 'They've ended,' Angouleme said, looking down at the pristine snow. 'The horse has  disappeared like in an Elvish circus.'  'What now, Geralt?' Cahir turned in his saddle. 'The tracks have disappeared. The wind  has covered them.'  'No,' disagreed Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"I'll... I'll make a  reconnaissance flight.'  'Fly.'  The vampire disappeared, as if the wind had carried him away. Geralt had no time to  marvel. Again they met men, armed this time. Cahir and Angouleme rushed towards them  shouting, but their opponents ran.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"From around the  gallery sounded a cry, a roar of anger, rage and horror. 'The Great Sun...' Cahir whistled. Geralt squeezed his arm. 'Let's go! Help Angouleme!'  From the gallery, a shower of arrows fell upon Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"An arrow hit the wall and dusted Milva's hair in lime  powder. The archer blew a strand of hair from her eyes and readied her bow. 'Milva,' Geralt called after Cahir and Angouleme had run to safety. 'Enough! Run!'  'Just one more,' said the archer, with the feather of the arrow at the corner of her mouth.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"It tore into her guts and severed an artery and shattered her pelvis. The archer fell  to the floor as if hit by a battering ram. Geralt and Cahir cried out with one voice. Aware that the Milva was down, the archers in  the gallery once again jumped up and fired a hail of arrows. One of the arrows hit Cahir's  helmet.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"In the place where she lay, in a blink of  an eye, it had grown into a puddle on the floor. Cahir cursed, his hands were shaking. Geralt  felt overwhelmed by despair. And rage. 'Auntie!' howled Angouleme.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"'We have to get out of here,' the knight took off his helmet and looked at Ciri. 'I am  Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, the son of Ceallach. I came here with Geralt. To rescue you, Ciri. I  know that it is unbelievable.'  'I've seen unbelievable things,' Ciri said.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"'You have come a long way... Cahir... Where is  Geralt?'  He stared at her. She remembered those eyes from Thanedd. Deep, blue, nice.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"But he wants me and will not chase you... Go. Help Geralt...'  Cahir shook his head. 'Ciri,' he said mildly. 'I'm surprised at you.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Bonhart caught the false note in her voice. He looked  suspicious. 'The Geralt? Really?'  Cahir swung his sword, standing in position. Bonhart did not waver.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"On his chest glistened three silver medallions – an eagle, a cat  and a wolf. 'If you're a real Geralt,' the Bounty hunter gritted his teeth, 'know that soon your amulet  will adorn my collection. And if you're not the Geralt, you'll be dead before you can blink  your eyes. It would be more sensible, in that case, to get out of my way and flee. I want this  wench, I have nothing against you.'  'Strong words,' Cahir said calmly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"I want this  wench, I have nothing against you.'  'Strong words,' Cahir said calmly. 'Let's see what else you can do. Angouleme, Ciri,  run!'  'Cahir...'  'Go,' he said, 'help Geralt.'  They ran off. Ciri helped the limping girl. 'You asked for it,' Bonhart narrowed his pale eyes, as he did he twirled his sword.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"'Not bad,' Bonhart gasped when they moved apart. 'Not bad boy. But you're not a  Geralt, that little bitch wanted to deceive me. It's your turn. Prepare to die.'  'Strong words.'  Cahir breathed deeply.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Then he turned his eyes to the Geralt. 'Vilgefortz?' he asked in a sonorous voice. Geralt shook his head. 'Cahir aep Ceallach?'  Another shake of his head. 'A slaughterhouse,' said the officer, looking at the staircase.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Cahir
"Maybe...'  'Maybe Coehoorn divided his Center Group Army,' finished Adam  Adieu  Pangratt,  chosen to be the supreme commander of the Free Company. 'Maybe he took only his Fourth  Cavalry and the horses from the Third and no infantry so he could proceed as quickly as  possible... Ha, you know what I'd do if I were coming up against King Foltest's constable  Natalis...'  'I know,' Pretty Kitty's eyes flashed with amusement. 'I know what you'd do, you'd send  runners.'  'Of course.'  'Natalis is a cunning fox. Maybe tomorrow...'  'Maybe,' Adieu said again.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"He  had eight thousand men, infantry and cavalry. The center of the army was located under the hill, which was later called Gallows Hill. On this high ground stood King Foltest's constable, John Natalis which gave him a perfect  view of the battlefield. Below him were grouped the main strength of our troops – twelve  thousand Temerian and Redanian infantry formed into four square units, beyond which were  arrayed ten banners of heavy cavalry. In reserve were three thousand Maribor infantry under  the command of Voivode Bronibor.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"'We cannot do more than we can,' he said quieter and warmer. 'But we will do our all,  we can do no less than that.'    ***    'They're charging,' Constable John Natalis said while wiping his sweaty palms on his  pants. 'The Nilfgaardians are charging, Your Majesty, they are coming for us!'  King Foltest, mastered his dancing horse, a white horse decorated with lilies on his saddle  and turned his noble profile, worthy of decorating coins towards the constable. 'We must prepare an appropriate welcome, Lord Constable! Officers!'  'Death to the Black ones!' yelled the condottiere Adam  Adieu  Pangratt and Count de  Ruyter.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"In this country, whose name I have forgotten, you can  finally show your worth as soldiers. That cloud you seen in the field is the Nilfgaardian  cavalry, which aims to destroy our army by attacking the flank and pushing our forces into  the swamp near the river, whose name I have forgotten, too. But you famous Vizima  pikemen, will defend the honour of King Foltest and Constable Natalis by filling in the gap  created by our ranks. You will close the gap with your breasts, halting the Nilfgaardians  charge. Rejoice, eh, comrades?",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"Like an avalanche rolling down from the mountains into the valley that collects more and  more snow and gains power, so did the consequences of the Battle of Brenna provide more  damage to the Nilfgaardians. The Verden Group Army was heavily afflicted by pirate raids  and attacks from Skellige and King Ethain from Cidaris. When Commander Duke de Wett  learned of the disaster at Brenna and the news reached him that Foltest and John Natalis had  ordered a forced march, he immediately sounded a retreat and in panic fled across the river  to Cintra and escaping significant losses to his troops, because word had gotten around  about Nilfgaard's defeat and a new rebellion was rising in force in Verden. Only troops  remained in the forts of Nastrog, Rozrog and Bodrog and after the Peace of Cintra they  emerged with honour with banners aloft. Meanwhile, in Aedirn, the news of what happen at Brenna caused the antagonised Kings  Demavend and Henselt to join together in arms against Nilfgaard's East Group Army, which  was led by Duke Ardal aep Dahy into the Pontar valley, unable to resist the combined forces  of the two kings.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"However, the most intense colours appeared on the shield that had been put up most  recently, those with the coat of arms of the Nilfgaardian nobles. Those who had distinguished  themselves during the conquest of the country and had proven themselves during the five- year imperial administration. Once we again hold Cintra, thought King Foltest, we will need to ensure that these coat  of arms are not destroyed in a fervour of restoration. Politics is one thing, aesthetics another. Changes to a regime do not justify vandalism.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"They sat at a round table, where the seats were identified by mahogany tablets. Meve, Queen of Rivia and Lyria. Foltest, King of Temeria and his vassal, King Venzlav of Brugge. Demavend, King of Aedirn. Henselt, King of Kaedwen.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"And the Earl Dijkstra. We should seek to get rid of this spy and remove him from the table of discussions, thought the hierarch. King Henselt and King Foltest, and even young King Kistrin, have already allowed themselves a few sour comments to our Nilfgaardian representatives. This Sigismund Dijkstra is a person of dubious origins with an unacceptable past and reputation. We cannot afford to have such a person distorting the atmosphere of the deliberations.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"'I will not hear any more  discussions about it! No more haggling! No more, I say, deiraedh!'  'Henselt,' Foltest said quietly in a conciliatory tone, 'don't hinder. And do not embarrass  us by screaming in front of His Excellency.'  Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the negotiator on behalf of the Empire of Nilfgaard, bowed with a  false smile, that suggested that the antics of the King of Kaedwen did not irritate or ultimately  interest him. 'Are we going to start attacking each other,' continued Foltest, 'like a pack of rabid dogs?",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"The army of  Kaedwen, which breached my boarders as an aggressor and occupier, has one week to leave  the fortresses and castles that they have illegally occupied in Upper Aedirn. That is the  condition for me to continue to take part in these negotiations. And verba volant, my  secretary will add an official protocol in that sense.'  'Henselt?' Foltest gave him a questioning look. 'Never!' bellowed the King of Kaedwen, overturning his chair and jumping like a  chimpanzee stung by a hornet. 'I will never give up the Marches!",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"'You're late to a feast that has  the presence of kings. Bloody hell, Sigismund, your distain for protocol is well known, and  you do not need to flaunt it, on a day like this...'  'I have my reasons,' Dijkstra responded with a look from Queen Hedwig and the raising  of his eyebrows from the hierarch of Novigrad. He also caught the scowl on the face of priest  Willemer and the sneer on the face of King Foltest. 'Can I have a word with you Phil?'  'Alone, I imagine...'  'That would be best,' Dijkstra smiled. 'But, if you prefer, I have no objection to more eyes  watching.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,King
"'Grandpa Jarre! Grandpa Jarre!'  Jarre looked up from the paper and pushed his glasses further up on his nose. 'Grandpa Jarre!' screamed the high pitched voice of his youngest granddaughter, a bright  and lively six year old, which, thank the gods, looked like her mother, Jarre's daughter and  not his son-in-law. 'Grandpa Jarre! Granma Lucienne told me to tell you that is enough writing for today and  that dinner is on the table!'  Jarre carefully place the reams of paper and put the cork into the inkwell.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"The bells of Novigrad rang, signalling the  victory and as a sign of great glory. But the ringing was strangely mournful. ***    'Hold the reins, Jarre,' Lucienne said. 'I'm getting something to eat. Wrap the reins  around your hand.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"Lucienne, he had no choice but to admit, was quite different, in that sense, than the rest of  the people. She neither pretended not to see or fell into mannerisms that degraded or  humiliated him. Jarre several times found himself thinking that this blonde girl treated him  naturally and normally. But that idea constant fought back. He Refused to accept it, because  he could not bring himself to behave normally or naturally.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"The wagon swung and swayed like a ship in  a storm. The mutilated, most lame and legless soldiers cursed and swore hoarsely. Lucienne  held onto Jarre, hugging him, sharing her magical warmth, his prodigious softness and  exciting mix of smells – horse, leather, hay, oats and girlish sweat. The wagon jumped at the next pothole. Jarre pulled on the rein wrapped around his wrist.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"Jarre pulled on the rein wrapped around his wrist. Lucienne, alternately eating bread and sausage clung to his side. 'Well, well...' she noticed his brass medallion and craftily took advantage that Jarre's one  hand was occupied with the reins. 'What have we here? A love charm?",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"The  demand for these were great during the war, especially after too much vodka. What is the  name of the girl you wear inside? Let me see...'  'Lucienne,' Jarre blushed like a tomato, 'do not open it, please... I'm sorry, but that is my  personal thing. I do not want to offend you, but...'  The wagon jumped and Lucienne snuggled into Jarre silently.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"If a girl loves a man, so loves all of him and  not little pieces. Therefore, she loves him even when a piece is missing.'  The wagon jumped. 'You are oversimplifying it,' Jarre said through clenched teeth. 'Oversimplifying and  idealising, Lucienne. You're forgetting the little detail, that is when a man is whole, he is  supposed to be able to support his wife and family.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"That you were a scribe in a temple. So the hand... Bah...'   The wagon had been driving for a while without hitting any potholes, but Jarre and  Lucienne seemed unaware – they remained firmly pressed together. 'Well,' she said after a long pause, 'I'm lucky with scholars. There was one...",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"In their hands, held out to the elves, as if  by magic, appeared food, bread, cheese, slices of bacon and sausages. And the elves, for the first time in a thousand years, spread their hands towards humans. Lucienne and Jarre were the first people who saw the elves cry. Great choking sobs, not  even trying to wipe the tears from their dirty faces. Refuting the claims that elves did not  have tear ducts.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"The terrorists. The fugitives, survivors from a commando unit  destroyed two days ago. Jarre, Lucienne and the cripples in the wagon avoided eye contact with the white-haired,  one-handed rider and indistinctly mumbled that they had not seen any elves or met anybody  on the road. You lie, thought the woman who was once Black Rayla. I know you are lying.",The Lady of the Lake,Jarre,Lucienne
"When Commander Duke de Wett  learned of the disaster at Brenna and the news reached him that Foltest and John Natalis had  ordered a forced march, he immediately sounded a retreat and in panic fled across the river  to Cintra and escaping significant losses to his troops, because word had gotten around  about Nilfgaard's defeat and a new rebellion was rising in force in Verden.

With the addition of the strength of the troops from Redania and the  guerrilla squads of Queen Meve, who undertook combat actions in the rear of the enemy,  they forced Nilfgaard to Aldersberg. Ardal aep Dahy prepared for battle, but due to fate he  suddenly became serious ill, perhaps from spoiled food he got colic and diarrhoea and two  days later died in pain.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"Meve, Queen of Rivia and Lyria. Foltest, King of Temeria and his vassal, King Venzlav of Brugge. Demavend, King of Aedirn. Henselt, King of Kaedwen. Ethan, King of Cidaris.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"'I resent such rude comments, particularly from some fucking spy! I am the fucking anointed  King!'  'It can't be seen at first glance,' Meve muttered. Demavend, turned away from looking at the shields on the rooms walls, smiling with  distain, as if not concerned about the future of his kingdom. 'Enough!' wheezed Henselt, his eyes rolling. 'Enough, by the gods.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"By the gods, is it to be the  face of crime and looting? Should it be maintained in the lawless status quo? Should stolen  goods remain in the hands of thugs and robbers?'  Henselt grabbed a map from the table, tore it in two and with a rapid movement threw it  at Demavend. The King of Aedirn did not even move. 'My armies,' Henselt spluttered, his face turning the colour of a well aged wine, 'won the  Marches from the Nilfgaardians.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"'We know the content of  the memorandum of Emperor Emhyr. The kings down there have not have time to thoroughly  discuss this issue, but they have already hinted at their approaches. The king whose voice  carries most interest, you might say, is King Demavend.'  'Demavend's position,' Sile adjusted the fur boa around her neck, 'can be described as  extremely helpful. I consider his position to be thoughtful and balanced. Shilard Fitz- Oesterlen will be no small trouble trying to argue in the direction of greater concessions.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"We really need to  know what we can allow the kings.'  Francesca Findabair smiled more beautifully. 'For the cause of peace and pro bon public,' she said. 'I agree with the proposal f King  Demavend. From now on, my dear friends, you can stop titling me, Your Majesty, Your  Grace will be enough.'  'Elven jokes,' said Sabrina. 'I never laugh, probably because I don't understand them.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,King
"I read poorly. But even then I knew what I wanted. I wanted to be like  Philippa Eilhart or Sile de Tansarville, and Assire var Anahid...'  Both looked at the gouache, representing a table in the hall of a castle with women sitting  around it. Legendary women. 'At the Academy,' continued Nimue, 'in which I entered on the second attempt, I was  concerned with only the legend of the Grand Lodge and its aspect in the history of magic  lectures.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"There was indignation in Triss Merigold's blue-eyed gaze. She could not decipher  the smiles of Francesca or Sile. It begins,  said Assire var Anahid, pointing to the magical image. They sat down comfortably. In order to see better, Philippa dampened the candlelight with a  spell.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"No one is perfect. Philippa snorted softly. Assire var Anahid sighed and looked up at the ceiling. Ultimately,  Sile added with pursed lips,  it is something that each of us has already  experienced at some point. Each of us, as we sit here, has at some time been betrayed,  exploited, or made a mockery of by a man.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"Adept Nimue!'  'Present, Mistress.'  'Can you answer the questions? If not, sit straight and do not waste my time.'  'I can.'  'Well, I'm listening.'  'So it stands in the annals that the convent of masters took place at the Castle of Bald  Mountain and there they agree to end the destructive war between the Emperor and the Kings  of the North. Reverend Mother Assire, the holy martyr, decided that the rulers would not stop  fighting until completely exhausted. Whereupon, Reverend Mother Philippa, the holy martyr  decided,  Let's give them an unimaginably horrible, cruel and bloody battle, a battle that will  be unprecedented. That the imperial armies and troops of the kings will be swimming in the  blood of that battle, and then, we, the Grand Lodge will force them to make peace .",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"IN the last three months she had been able to product a magic  cream which acted on blood vessels. Thanks to that cream the blush on her face didn't show,  and no one could know that she was ashamed. 'Vilgefortz was hiding in castle Stygga,' Assire var Anahid confirmed. 'It is in Ebbing on  the shore of a mountain lake whose name, my informant, a common soldier, cannot  remember.'  'You used the past tense,' Francesca Findabair said. 'Correct,' Philippa took control again.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"We all  do. Some more than others.'  All the sorceresses as if on command looked at Fringilla, but the cream was working  reliably. Assire var Anahid sighed. Philippa slapped her hand on the table. 'Although it may seem like an excuse,' she said dryly, 'our activities associated with the  war and the preparation of the peace negotiations and the fact that the Lodge was not  involved with the case and final solution of Vilgefortz, have to be considered as a failure on  our part.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"There is no question about it. If any of  you ladies doubt this, I have a right to feel offended.'  Philippa Eilhart and Sile de Tansarville expressed their appreciation by bowing. Assire  var Anahid thanked her with a smile. 'Let us return to the problem of Dol Blathanna,' said Sabrina. 'We know the content of  the memorandum of Emperor Emhyr.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"We are inextricably linked and that cannot be changed... With all  due respect.'  Margarita Laux-Antille smile and looked her in the eyes. The simple yet elegant, Assire  var Anahid, a Nilfgaardian with a slightly aquiline nose, nodded and tapped her fingers gently  on the table's surface. 'Philippa,' said a woman with a silver fox boa around her neck. 'I think that in this  respect we should not go to extremes.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"This is the round table  of the Lodge, and all who sit at it are equals – even when one of us is on trial. I think that we  can agree...'  She did not finish, she glanced at all the sorceresses. One by one, they all nodded their  heads in agreement – Margarita, Triss, Assire, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and both elves. Only the second Nilfgaardian, the dark-haired Fringilla Vigo did not give an affirmative nod,  she was pale as death as she stared at Yennefer. 'So be it,' Philippa Eilhart waved her hand.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"Not a word! Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table. Ciri was not the only one to shrink and draw he head down between  her shoulders but other magicians of the Lodge as well, with maybe the exception of  Philippa, Francesca and Assire. And Yennefer. 'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Philippa
"Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety. That it was,  she admitted. Perfectly sincere.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Francesca
"There was indignation in Triss Merigold's blue-eyed gaze. She could not decipher  the smiles of Francesca or Sile. It begins,  said Assire var Anahid, pointing to the magical image.

'Correct,' Philippa took control again.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Francesca
"I would not want us to miss a single word.'  The sorceresses, interrupting their gossip and quickly took their seats. Sile de Tansarville,  wore a silver boa, a feminine accent to her austere black outfit. Assire var Anahid was  dressed in a violet silk dress, which was graceful and combined simplicity and modest  elegance. Francesca Findabair was majestic as ever. Ida Emean aep Sivney was mysterious as  usual.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Francesca
"Not a word! Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table.

'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Francesca
"If Tissaia was among us she would not agree that in   order to maintain the unity of the Lodge it is necessary to use coercive methods or restriction  of personal freedom.'  'I vote for her,' said Francesca Findabair, adjusting the lace at her neckline. 'I have many  reasons, but I do not wish to explain them.'  'I vote for her,' said Ida Emean aep Sivney. 'So my heart dictates.'  'I'm against it,' Assire var Anahid said dryly. 'I do not decide out of lack of sympathy,  antipathy or principled reasons. I fear for her life.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Francesca
"'We are not doing this to test your abilities as a dreamer, we are  analysing the legend. The riddles and blank spaces. It goes pretty well for us, as in the first  dream you've discovered who was the girl in the portrait, The double of Ciri who Vilgefortz  attempted to deceive Emperor Emhyr...'   She stopped because into the kitchen came the Fisher King. He bowed, muttered and  pulled out a loaf of bread, a bottle and a package wrapped in cloth from the cupboard. Then  he turned to leave, not forgetting to bow and grunt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"He was busy blowing bubble. He held a bowl with soap and water and a straw, into which  he blew again and again, as iridescent rainbow bubbles floated down to the river. Ciri coughed softly. The King of the Alders turned. Ciri could not help but sigh.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"You speak  our language perfectly, but you should pay more attention to intonation and pronunciation.'  'Is it important to intonate? It would not if you had not brought me here to talk.'  'Nothing hurts when aspiring to perfection.'  From the end of the straw emerged a new bubble which detached and began to float  through the air, before exploding on impact with a willow branch. Ciri sighed again  'So you are in a hurry to return to your world,' said King Auberon Muiretach. 'Your  world! You people really do not suffer from excessive modesty.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
'But it is true. Your eyes are  Shiadhal. Lara's eyes.'  Ciri looked down. She felt stupid and insecure. The King of the Alders rested his elbows  on the railing and his chin in his hands.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"The book was richly illustrated. In fact, all that were in it were illustrations. Although Ciri  tried to play the sophisticated lady, she felt her cheeks flush. In the temple library in Ellander  she had seen similar works. But the book the King of the Alders had, those others could not  compete in wealth or the variety of items, or the artistry of the imagery.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"In the morning her was not with her. ***    The next night, for the first time, the King of the Alders showed signs of impatience. Ciri  found him leaning over a table, where there was a mirror set in a frame of amber. There was a  white powder on the mirror. Here we go, thought Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"And do you  want to know something else? Come closer, I whisper it. Let it be our secret.'  Ciri leaned forward. 'I'm afraid,' he whispered. 'I know.'  'Are you with me?'  'I am.'  'Va Faill, Luned.'  'Goodbye, King of the Alders/'  She sat beside him, still holding his hand after his breathing hushed and ceased.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"I want to reveal a secret.'  'What do you have to tell me?' he laughed. 'What pathetic secret?'  'This, that you will not fit under this bridge.'  Without any time to react, he hit the bottom of the bridge, and flew forward, losing his  balance completely. Ciri could simply throw him out of the boat, however, that was not   enough and she was afraid that he would continue his pursuit. Moreover, he intentionally or  by negligence killed the King of the Alders. And he had to feel pain.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"But the artists and painters, took a liking  to this episode. Look, here is a picture with Ciri with a unicorn. Here is Ciri with a unicorn on  a cliff above the sea, here on a narcotic induced landscape, and here under two moons.'  Nimue was silent. 'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides. Ciri and the unicorn in the labyrinth of worlds, Ciri and the unicorn in the abyss of  time...'  'Ciri and the unicorn,' interrupted Nimue, looking out the window at the lake, to the boat  with the Fisher King.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"in  a dream.'  The Fisher King, judging from the intensity of his voice and curses, failed to untangle the  rope, and it broke. Nimue was silent, looking at the pictures. Ciri and the Unicorn. 'It is true,' she said at last, 'I have seen this in my dreams. I have seen it in my dreams  many times.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"Both were silent staring at the sun. they stayed that way for a  long time. 'Lady of the Lake?'  'I asked you not to call me that.'  'Lady Ciri?'  'Go ahead.'  'Come with me to Camelot, Lady Ciri. You have to meet King Arthur, he will show you  honour and reverence... I will...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,King
"Just explain some things.'  'I'm at your service. What do you want to know?'  'You know what.'  For a time they rode in silence. Ciri saw some swans floating down the river. 'The father.'

"'Zireael,' Eredin explained, 'should appear before the king, unhurried, without pressure,  relaxed, calm and in good spirits. To ensure a good mood, a bath, new clothes, a new  hairstyle and makeup. Auberon can probably endure that long.'  Ciri sighed deeply and looked carefully at the dark-haired elf. She was surprised at his  sudden sympathy. Eredin flashed her a smile with his straight white teeth without canines.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"And full of indescribable sadness. 'Zireael,' he said. 'Thank you for agreeing to see me.'  Ciri stood silently not knowing what to say. Auberon Muircetach blew into the straw  again, and launched another bubble into the air. To control her trembling hands, she clasped them together and cracked her fingers, then  nervously smoothed her hair.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"You speak  our language perfectly, but you should pay more attention to intonation and pronunciation.'  'Is it important to intonate? It would not if you had not brought me here to talk.'

You people really do not suffer from excessive modesty.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"In that time, it will surprise you, it was possible to move freely from one world to  another quite easily. With some talent and practice, that is. I have no doubt that you  understand what I mean.'  Ciri was intrigues, but remained silent, aware that the elf was teasing. She did not want to  facilitate the task. Auberon Muircetach smiled.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"'You cannot be. You are Aen Hen Ichaer, the  Elder Blood. Come.'  He extended his hand and Ciri inadvertently clenched her teeth. But Auberon only  touched her forearm and then her hands. She felt a pleasant tingling.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"And  because there was a question of destiny, know that this is your destiny. Being the beginning  and the end. Do you understand?'  Ciri hesitated a few seconds. But the vehement look from Auberon forced her to reply. 'I understand.'  'Take off your clothes,' he said it so casually and carelessly, she nearly exploded with  anger.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"You  certainly already noticed that he is ambitious. There are things that he'll never accept, never  take note of. He'd sooner die.'  Ciri was silent, biting her lip and glancing at the couch. 'Auberon Muircetach,' said the elf, 'never uses magic or other means able to change a  situation. But such means exist.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"Ciri  found him leaning over a table, where there was a mirror set in a frame of amber. There was a  white powder on the mirror. Here we go, thought Ciri. With a knife, Auberon was gathering the fisstech and distributing it into two strips. He  took a tube of silver off of the table and inhaled the drug through the nose, first by his left  nostril, then his right.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Auberon
"Before the terrible Emhyr  var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard. 'What is your name?' he asked sharply. 'Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon.'  'Your real name.'  'Ciri Fiona...'  'Do not try my patience. Name!'  'Ciri...' the girl's voice broke like a reed stalk. 'Fiona...'  'Enough, by the Great Sun,' he said through clenched teeth, 'Enough!'  In a breach of etiquette, she sniffed loudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"'Because it is a bland name, Imperial Majesty. A person who wears it is a nobody. As long as I'm Ciri Fiona, I mean something... As long as...'  Her voice stuck in her throat so rapidly that she instinctively raised her hands to her neck,  as if what she had on was not a necklace, but a choking garrotte. Emhyr continued to measure  her with his eyes, still full of praise for Stella Congreve.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"'We are not doing this to test your abilities as a dreamer, we are  analysing the legend. The riddles and blank spaces. It goes pretty well for us, as in the first  dream you've discovered who was the girl in the portrait, The double of Ciri who Vilgefortz  attempted to deceive Emperor Emhyr...'   She stopped because into the kitchen came the Fisher King. He bowed, muttered and  pulled out a loaf of bread, a bottle and a package wrapped in cloth from the cupboard. Then  he turned to leave, not forgetting to bow and grunt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"The double  stands before the throne with her head bowed. The artist has done this to emphasize her  mystique, even her features are hidden under the veil on her face. This is basically everything  we know about the false Ciri. No version of the legend mentions what happened to her later.'  'It's not hard to imagine,' Condwiramurs said sadly, 'that fate was not kind to the girl. When Emhyr got the original, and we all know that he acquired her, he got rid of the forgery.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"I have my  reasons for it.'  'Bah!' Sheldon Skaggs replied, shaking his hands. 'Why spend saliva in vain. Ciri,  Emhyr, destiny... They are distant issues. Our concern is Menno Coehoorn the Field Marshal  of the Center Army Group.'  'Well,' sighed Zoltan Chivay.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"I was so etched in your memory?'  'I did not recognise you, you've actually change very much. I figured out who you are  already, some time ago. Not without outside help and guidance, I guessed what role you were  to play in family incest with Ciri. And in one of my nightmares I once dreamed of hideous  incest. And here you are, in the flesh.'  'You can hardly keep your feet,' Emhyr said coldly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"'Several times. I thank you for that. On behalf of  me and on behalf of my descendants.'  'You leave me speechless.'  'Ciri,' Emhyr said ignoring the sarcasm, 'is going to Nilfgaard. In due time she will  become the Empress. Like dozens of girls who become queens, without previously knowing  her husband.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"Pavetta could not  live. She would have denounced you. She would never let you do what you intend to do to  Ciri.'  'She would have lived,' Emhyr contradicted him. 'Somewhere else... Somewhere far  away.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"You have no  other way out. There are no other solutions. If I escape from prison I'll come for Ciri. It is the  price I must pay and you know it.'  'I know it.'  'You can spare Yennefer's life. She does not know the secret.'  'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"Then I am at your disposal.'  Emhyr stood up, walked to the window and stared out the dark portal. 'I cannot deny this. But...'  'Do not worry; I won't say anything to Ciri. It would hurt her severely, if I told her who  you are. And I cannot hurt her.'  After a long silence, Emhyr turned from the window.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"This  is not fair!'  'He who lives by the sword,' Emhyr var Emreis said dully,' dies by the sword. They both  fought with me and lost. But they lose with dignity.'  Ciri, in three steps stood before him, Geralt silently gasped. He heard Yennefer sigh. Bloody hell, he thought, anyone can see it!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"Fortunately she inherited her mother's ashen mane. But even so,  those who aren't blind can see whose blood she is. 'You,' Ciri said, directing an angry look at Emhyr. 'You won. And you think you won  with dignity?'  Emhyr var Emreis did not respond.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"And you think you won  with dignity?'  Emhyr var Emreis did not respond. He just smiled and eyed the angry girl. Ciri clenched  her teeth. 'So many dead, so many dead for this end? And they lost with honour?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"The Emperor, Emhyr var Emreis stopped, this dark man whose face had awakened  strange and confusing memories. With a sharp order, he ordered he loose. Ciri sniffed and  wiped her eyes with her sleeve. Seeing the Emperor approach he stifled a sob and proudly  raised her head. Although at the time she realise how ridiculous she must look.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"Enjoying the esteem of  the emperor Emhyr var Emreis (sic), she was considered a person of great importance by the  court. While she had no official duties, it was generally believed that the emperor was in the  habit of paying considerable attention to her words and opinions. Because of her close  personal relationship with the young Empress Ciri Fiona (sic), whom she loved like her  own daughter, she was jokingly referred to as the  Imperial mother-in-law . She outlived  both the Emperor and the Empress, and died in 1331; as to her huge fortune, it fell to distant   relatives on the Liddertal side of the family, called the Whites; being stupid and short- sighted, they squandered every bit of their inheritance. Effenberg and Talbot  Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, tome III         Chapter Ten      The man stealthily approaching the camp was very clever and cunning.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"Not for a moment. And yet now Emhyr has married the little barbarian. He  rejected the possibility of reconciling with imperial nobility and marring their daughters and  married Ciri of Cintra. Why? To dominate a small country, that half, if not more,  Nilfgaard would have gained during negotiations?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
"This is the work of sorceresses. But why would  it not be? Undoubtedly, it was written that Ciri would be Emhyr's wife, Queen of Cintra and  Empress of Nilfgaard. No doubt it was her destiny. Keep it this way, Triss Merigold thought happily.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Emhyr
'Eredin.'  'You owe me for the help. To be paid off when requested.'  'I will pay when you ask.'  The black-haired elf jumped to the ground. Avallac'h also dismounted and motioned for  Ciri and the others to do the same. They climbed the hill between the upright stones  surrounded by bushes and blooming myrtle. Ciri eyed her companions.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Light and Dark. 'Zireael, let me introduce to you this man – Eredin Breacc Glas.'  'Nice to meet you.' The elf bowed. Ciri replied with a clumsy bow. 'How did you know,' asked Avallac'h, 'that something threatened us?'  'I didn't know,' the elf looked at Ciri intently. 'I patrol the plains, because news has  spread that the unicorns have grown restless and aggressive.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"'Generally speaking,' sneered the dark-haired elf, 'I can see something in the little  Dh'oine. I can see it and appreciate it. Like I've found a nugget of gold on a pile of manure.'  Ciri's eyes flashed angrily. Avallac'h slowly raised his head. 'You talk,' he said slowly, 'just like a human, Eredin.'   Eredin Breacc Glas smiled showing his teeth.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Before the porch of one of the palaces, they were met by Eredin Breacc Glas. On his  instruction small grey-clad elves ran quickly and quietly to handle their horses. Ciri watched  him in some surprise. Avallac'h, Eredin and all the elves that she had met so far were  extremely tall, so that to look them in the eye she had to bend back her head. These grey  elves were smaller than her.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"'Zireael,' Eredin explained, 'should appear before the king, unhurried, without pressure,  relaxed, calm and in good spirits. To ensure a good mood, a bath, new clothes, a new  hairstyle and makeup. Auberon can probably endure that long.'  Ciri sighed deeply and looked carefully at the dark-haired elf. She was surprised at his  sudden sympathy. Eredin flashed her a smile with his straight white teeth without canines.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"'The only thing that concerns me,' he said, 'our Swallow's eyes – twinkling like a hawk,  have not stopped glancing left and right, like a ferret looking for a hole in her cage. From  what I can see, Swallow is far from an unconditional surrender.'  Avallac'h did not say anything. Ciri, of course, said nothing as well. 'I'm not surprised,' Eredin continued. 'She could not be otherwise, since she is the blood  of Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Listen to me very carefully, Zireael. There is no escape. You  cannot break a Geas Garadh, a barrier of Magic.'  The look Ciri throw his way clearly said that would have to be proven to be believed. 'Even if by some miracle, you collapse the barrier,' Eredin was not distracted by her look,  'you know that it would mean your doom. This world seems very beautiful.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"The  bridge was narrow. Eredin gave a cry and the stallion, incredibly, accelerated. Ciri  immediately grasped what was going on. The bridge would not for anything in the world, fit  two horses. One had to slow down.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Ciri had no intention of slowing down. She clung to the mane and Kelpie pulled forward  like an arrow. Ciri brushed the stirrup of the elf and flew onto the bridge. Eredin's stallion  screamed, reared up and struck an alabaster figure, it fell from its pedestal and smashed into  pieces. Ciri, giggling like a ghost, galloped across the bridge, without looking back.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"And  now you're talking about caresses?'  Eredin approached Kelpie, rubbed and patted her neck and looked surprised to see that  the mare was dry. Kelpie abruptly withdrew her head and let out a prolonged shriek. Eredin  turned to Ciri. If he also gives me a pat, she thought, He will regret it. 'Come with me, please.'  They walked along a stream, running down a steep, densely forested slopes, that led up to  stairs made of rundown sandstone.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"All  around them was forest, a primeval forest, where there were many old ash and hornbeam,  yew trees, maples and oaks, there feet tangled in hazel bushes. It smelled of sage, nettle, wet  stones, spring and mildew. Ciri walked quietly, without haste and with easy breaths. She also had her nerves under  control. She had no idea what Eredin wanted from her, but she did not have the best feelings.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"She could also not find Eredin. But that was quite normal – he was often out of the city  accompanied by his Dearg Ruadhri, his Red Riders. Ciri went and got Kelpie from the stables and went across the river. She was deep in  thought and took no notice to anything around her. I have to escape.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Something flashed across the bridge, quiet, agile, like a big black rat. It rocked the boat  when it jumped into the bow. Ciri dropped the pole and drew her sword. 'I see,' hissed Eredin Breacc Glas, 'you want to deprive us of your company?'  He also drew his sword. During a brief lightning flash she was able to see the weapon.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"She parried his lunged rather instinctively, because in the dark she could  barely see. She returned his attack with a quick bottom cut. Eredin parried and struck out  again, Ciri deflected the blow. From the blades, sparks flew. Again he rocked the boat.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Eredin
"Little horse – Ihuarraquax – ears pricked up, stamped his hooves and stared at  her with his black eyes. The red unicorn stamped until the earth trembled and shook  menacingly. He snorted angrily and Ciri understood. You do not trust us. 'I do not trust you,' she said coldly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"'Ihuarraquax will come with me.'    ***    That evening the sky became cloudy and it became muggy, from the river rose a thick,  stick mist. When it became dark, from afar came muffled thunder and lightning lit up the  horizon. Ciri had long been prepared. Dressed in black riding clothes, with her sword on her back,  tense and impatient, waiting for the coming of night. When it came, she silently walked  through deserted halls and stealthily took arcades and descended terraces.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
It was the voices of their pursuers. Ihuarraquax neighed. Ciri received his signal. Understood the importance. She adhered  herself to Kelpie's neck.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
Kelpie snorted and  puffed. She was wet and hot. Ciri could see Ihuarraquax. He stood shaking his head and his  horn. Pawing at the ground with his hooves.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"Ihuarraquax neighed again, prompting her to hurry. Kelpie replied. Ciri pulled on her  gloves. 'I'm ready.'  There was a roar in her ears. A flash.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"Ihuarraquax whinnied again, urging her to hurry. Kelpie whinnied as well. Ciri pulled on  a pair of gloves. 'I'm ready,' she said. A buzz sounded in her ears.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"These are not my world or my time! Please try to get better. Please.'  Ihuarraquax whinnied and nodded his horn and sent Ciri a mental idea. Ciri  misunderstood. She had no time to thin since the inside of her skull was again flooded by a  cold clarity, her ears buzzed and her body tingled.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"Down on a stony beach, Ciri could suddenly distinguish the skeleton of a giant monstrous  fish head partly buried in the gravel. The teeth that protruded from the white jaw were over  three feet in length and the jaw itself gave the sense that one could going riding through the  portal of the ribs without ever touching the head or spine. Ciri was not sure if this was her world or her time as there were fish like that there as  well. They walked along the edge of the cliff. Seagulls and albatrosses did not seem frightened  at all, they did not move out of the way, they even pecked and slashed their beaks at Kelpie   and Ihuarraquax.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"The unicorn's hooves rang on the stones of the waterfront. He shook his mane and horn  and melodically neighed. 'Ihuarraquax,' Ciri spoke to him. 'I was hoping you'd come.'  The unicorn came closer, neighing again and digging his hooves into the hard  cobblestones. He lowered his head, the horn which sprang from his head suddenly blazed  with light, with a sheen that dispelled the fog.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Ihuarraquax
"And though Yennefer had taught her all the names of the women she  would meet in this castle, Ciri immediately though of her as Lady Owl. 'We welcome you,' Lady Owl said. 'To the Lodge in Montecalvo, Ciri.'  Ciri bowed as instructed by Yennefer, politely, but without lowering her eyes modestly  like a maiden. It was answered with a sincere smile from Triss Merigold and a nod and a friendly look  from Margarita Laux-Antille. The looks from the other women where hard as augers.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"I think that we  can agree...'  She did not finish, she glanced at all the sorceresses. One by one, they all nodded their  heads in agreement – Margarita, Triss, Assire, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and both elves. Only the second Nilfgaardian, the dark-haired Fringilla Vigo did not give an affirmative nod,  she was pale as death as she stared at Yennefer. 'So be it,' Philippa Eilhart waved her hand. 'Sit, both of you.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Triss  Merigold sighed unnoticed. Rather, she believed it had been unnoticed. 'Please,' Yennefer looked at he. 'What strange sounds float from you beauteous breast,  Triss. Ciri, go out and see what lies ahead.'  Triss averted her face, determined not to give Yennefer any excuse.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Ciri, go out and see what lies ahead.'  Triss averted her face, determined not to give Yennefer any excuse. She sis not expect it  to work. For a long time she had been sensing Yennefer's anger and aggression growing  stronger as they approached Rivia. 'You, Triss,' Yennefer mischievously insisted, 'do not blush, do not sigh, do not drool or  wiggle around in your saddle. Or is it that you think because I agreed to your request that I  want to have you with us?",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Ciri, I asked you to go on ahead. The two of us need to talk!'  'It is not a discussion, it is a lecture,' Ciri dared to argue, but under the threatening glare  from violet eyes, she immediately recoiled, clucked and galloped off on Kelpie on the road  ahead. 'You're not going to meet a loved one, Triss,' Yennefer continued. 'I am not so noble or  stupid enough to give you the opportunity, or him the temptation. But just for today.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"But one thing I must tell you, Yennefer. Do  not count too much on fainting. He knows how to forgive.'  'He knows what was done to him, of course,' Yennefer narrowed her eyes. 'But he will  never forgive you for what was done to Ciri. And me.'  'It is possible,' Triss swallowed.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"They had enough presence of mind to immediately kick their horses into a gallop. But  their mounts were not able to keep pace with Kelpie. 'What is it?' shouted Yennefer, cutting the wind. 'What is going on?'  'You know!' sobbed Triss, galloping at her side. 'Ride, Yennefer!'  They had ridden between the city's outskirts before they passed their first fugitives fleeing  from the city, Yennefer was bright enough to know what was happening in Rivia, no fire or  raid of troops, but a pogrom.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"'Witch! Elf sorceress!'  Another man rushed at her brandishing an axe. Yennefer shot flames into his face, his  eyeballs boiled and them burst, running down his cheeks with a hiss. She relaxed, someone  grabbed her by the arm, and Yennefer pulled ready to shot, but it was Triss. 'Let's go...",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Until the end of my days I'm going to be scared to death. Because  those who do not break the cowardice, will be scared to death until the end of their days. The fingers that Triss dug into her arm were like steel, Yennefer liberated herself from the  grip with a great effort. 'Run if you want!' she shouted. 'Hide under the skirts of the Lodge!",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Someone had dragged her across the ground,  it was Triss, she was met by the smell of her perfume. Close to them, on the pavement, shod  hooves rang, with a vibrated clang. Yennefer saw a rider in full armour, with a white shield  with a red chevron, from the height of his saddle he was whipping the crowd. Stones hurled  by the mob bounced harmlessly off on the armour and helmet. The horse neighed and kicked  out.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"At least one front tooth  was chipped or knocked out and it hurt to talk. 'Triss...' she stammered. 'Teleport us out of here!'  'No, Yennefer,' Triss's voice was very quiet and very cold. 'They'll kill us...'  'No, Yennefer. I will not run away.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"The crowd had finally managed to knock the knight from his horse. He was dragged to  the ground with a terrible crash and the mob crawled over him like lice. Triss grabbed Yennefer and dragged her towards the pile of rubbish and raised her hands. She shouted a spell with such rage, that the crowd fell silent for a moment. 'They will kill us,' Yennefer spat blood.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"'Help me, Yennefer, 'Triss stopped for a moment. 'help me. Let's cast Alzur's Thunder...'  That will kill five, thought Yennefer. Then the rest will tear us apart. But okay, Triss.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"They again began  throwing stones at the sorceresses. Triss felt one whizz pass her head, but did not flinch. It won't work, thought Yennefer. The spell will not work. We cannot conjure up  something as complicated as Alzur's Thunder.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"But I wanted to ask you about something else. On version of the legend has it that  Triss was not alone on Rivia Hill. That Yennefer was also there with her.'  Nimue looked at the watercolour depicting a black mountain, steep and sharp as a knife,  against dark blue clouds. At the top of the hill could be seen a slender silhouette of a woman  with outstretched arms and red hair. Through the fog that covered the surface of the water came the rhythmic clatter of the  Fisher King's oars.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Triss made a strange cry or sob from her throat. Hail sparkled in the sun like diamonds. They were still falling, but the biggest downpour  had abated, Yennefer could tell by the pounding on the magical shield, then the hail stopped. Suddenly, as if cut off. Guards stormed into the street, the shoes of their horses scraped on the  ice.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Guards stormed into the street, the shoes of their horses scraped on the  ice. The rabble screamed and fled, whipped by whips and beaten with the flats of swords. 'Bravo, Triss,' croaked Yennefer. 'I don't know what that was... But it was effective.'  'There was something to defend,' croaked Triss Merigold - heroine of the hill.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"He lay motionless, but when they reached him, he  began to cough, and to spit blood. He began to shake and to tremble so violently that Ciri  could not hold him. Yennefer knelt beside him. Triss saw her hands shaking. Suddenly she  felt very weak and her vision blurred.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"She recognised Dandelion. 'It won't work,' said Ciri's voice, radiating despair. 'Your magic cannot cure him,  Yennefer.'  'We arrived...' Yennefer could barely move her lips. 'We're too late.'  'Your magic won't work, 'Ciri repeated as if she had not heard. 'Is this what it is worth, all  of your magic?'  You're right, Ciri, Triss thought, feeling something catch in her throat.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"'He is dying.'  Geralt continued to stir, coughing blood, then becoming very tense and froze. Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly. 'There is nothing more pathetic,' said Ciri sternly, 'than a sorceress in tears. You taught  me that.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
She was even more confident that the spell would prove powerless for  someone who was sterile. It was too late. The spell only exhausted Yennefer. Triss was  surprised that the black-haired sorceress was able to withstand for so long. Then she ceased to be surprised because Yennefer stopped in the middle of the magic  formula and fell on the pavement next to the Geralt.,The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"'Apologise to the ladies at Montecalvo, Triss,' she said. 'But it can be no other way. I  cannot stay if Geralt and Yennefer leave. I simple cannot. They must understand.'  'They must.'  'Goodbye, Triss Merigold.",The Lady of the Lake,Yennefer,Triss
"Both were shrouded in long scarlet cloaks. 'Let the young come forward!'  The  young  were instructed in advance what to do. Dandelion went to the Duchess and  Geralt stepped out to meet the dark-haired companion, which he knew as Fringilla Vigo. Both women dropped their cloaks and the crowd rose in a thunderous ovation. Geralt  swallowed.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"She  smelled of roses and amber. Her body was warm and soft. The women were brought to the vat, Geralt with Fringilla and the Duchess with  Dandelion and helped to stand up in the grape juice. The crowd roared. 'Ho, ho!'  Anarietta and Fringilla stood facing each other and laid their hands on each other's  shoulders to more easily maintain balance among the grapes, which rose to above their knees.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"Oh, we were poorly expressed. It  was not our whole group, we were missing Dandelion. Dandelion or rather Viscount Julian  was lounging in a chair beside Duchess Anarietta and strutted like a peacock. A royal  favourite. Only Anarietta, Fringilla and Dandelion sat.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"From this we begin to understand who your Ciri really is and what blood  flows in her viens... You know, you look even more sour than usual. What is the reason?'  'Dandelion.'  'Will you tell me about it?'  He spoke. Fringilla listened, sitting with her legs crossed on the pile of books. 'Hmmm,' she said when he had finished.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"I  have noticed Anarietta showing unmistakable signs of falling in love.'  'Falling in love?' he raised his eyebrows. 'Or a noble whim?'  'Do you not believe,' she looked at him sharply, 'of a pure and sincere love?'  'My belief or disbelief,' he said, 'has nothing to do with it. It is Dandelion and his  obsessive...'  He suddenly lost confidence and did not finish. 'With love,' Fringilla said, 'it is like nervous cramps. You cannot even be effect until they  attack, and you cannot even imagine something like that.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"It may have absconded from Pomerol  over the mountains. If so, I wish him all the best,  said Fringilla while gnawing on a goose bone. What is up with Dandelion? the Geralt said suddenly,  I haven't seen him for so long that  I draw all my knowledge of his activities from the satirical songs they sing in the city. We know no more than you.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Fringilla
"An anchor, as you say.'  'I'll do it. Lady Nimue?'  'I'm listening.'  'The two portraits. These hanging side by side...Are these not Ciri?'  'There are no portraits of Ciri,' Nimue patiently repeated. 'Later artists portrayed her only  in scenes, each according to his own imagination. As for the portraits, the one on the left is a  variation on the chosen topic, it is the elf Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal, a person who the painter  could not have known.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"'The only thing that concerns me,' he said, 'our Swallow's eyes – twinkling like a hawk,  have not stopped glancing left and right, like a ferret looking for a hole in her cage. From  what I can see, Swallow is far from an unconditional surrender.'  Avallac'h did not say anything. Ciri, of course, said nothing as well. 'I'm not surprised,' Eredin continued. 'She could not be otherwise, since she is the blood  of Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
'But it is true. Your eyes are  Shiadhal. Lara's eyes.'  Ciri looked down. She felt stupid and insecure. The King of the Alders rested his elbows  on the railing and his chin in his hands.,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"They will simply die from the cold. Those who survive will fall into barbarism,  killing each other in ruthless battles for food, they will become prey to predators mad with  hunger. Remember the text from the prophecy – The time of contempt, the Axe and the  Wolf's Blizzard.'  Ciri did not interrupt him, afraid that he would start playing the flute again. 'The child, on which so much depends,' said Avallac'h as he played with his flute, 'will  be a descendant of Lara Dorren and a carrier of the gene, a gene that was specially built by  us, it may save the inhabitants of your world. We have reason to think that the descenadant pf  Lara and your child, of course, will have abilities a thousand times more powerful than those  we have, the Knowing ones.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"We have reason to think that the descenadant pf  Lara and your child, of course, will have abilities a thousand times more powerful than those  we have, the Knowing ones. The same as you yourself possess. Do you know what I mean?'  Ciri had learned that in the Elder Speech such rhetorical figures, although seemingly  questions, do not require an answer, but simply prohibit a response. 'In short,' continued Avallac'h, 'we will have the opportunity to travel between the  worlds, and not for only a single person. We want to open Ard Gaeth – The Great Gate,  which all will pass through.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"Then on the island, he had  been very handsome. Now his face had changed, something had made him deformed and  awful. 'Excuse me, Mister Bonhart,' the sorcerer did not move from his throne-like chair, 'it is I,  the lord of castle Stygga who should assume the pleasant task of welcoming our guest, the  maiden Ciri of Cintra, Pavetta's daughter, Calanthe's granddaughter and descendant of  Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal. Be welcome. Come closer, please.'  The last words were not spoken under a mask of courtesy and ridicule.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"But you still need a last name. I would not be  against it, if you used mine.'  'Or mine,' Lady Owl said covering the smile on the corner of her lips. 'Ciri Eilhart also  sounds nice.'  'That name,' the hall rang with the silvery voice of the elven queen, 'is pretty in any  combination. And each of us here would love to have a daughter like you, Zireael, Swallow  with the eyes of a hawk. You are the body and the blood of Lara Dorren.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Lara
"A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon. The company of Geralt during a blizzard on the mountain  pass of Malheur...'  'Well done,' Nimue praised.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"That was a compliment, not sarcasm. But look at this  one, Gesta Regum. From this we begin to understand who your Ciri really is and what blood  flows in her viens... You know, you look even more sour than usual. What is the reason?'  'Dandelion.'  'Will you tell me about it?'  He spoke.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Not very well, if you're interested. But, I know the  local prince consort or candidate for consort. You also know him, Ciri.'  Ciri kicked Kelpie in the sides, making her dance in the road. 'Don't make me suffer!'  'Dandelion.'  Dandelion? With the Duchess?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"So they were caught completely by   surprise by the appearance of a cart from an ally, drawn by two horses. On the cart, trying to  maintain his balance with difficult was... 'Dandelion...' Ciri groaned. Geralt suddenly felt ill. Very ill.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"He face was no less mournful. 'Citizens of Beauclair and people from the surrounding countryside,' he read in a troubled  voice from parchment. 'Notice is hereby given that Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de  Lettenhove, aka Dandelion...'  'Pankratz what?' Ciri asked in a whisper. '...according to the Supreme Court ruling of this County has been found guilty of all  crimes, offenses and misdeed of which he was accused, insulting Her Majesty, treason of the  state and dishonouring the establishment of the nobility through perjury, libel, and slander,  also for dissipation and indecency, furthermore, obscenity and whoredom. The Tribunal had  decided that Viscount Julian et cetera, et cetera, his receive the following punishment – First,  mortification of his coat of arms, a thick black line through his shield.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"At the foot of the scaffold four ragged urchins held out a scarf to collect the blood in. There was a great demand for this type of souvenirs, and good money could be earned. 'Geralt,' Ciri said in a low voice. 'We have to so do something...'   He did not answer. 'I wish to speak to the people,' Dandelion said proudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"'My lands, forests and castles  you can have, but let me take my lute, my horse, Pegasus, my one hundred and forty  ducatsand eighty dimes, my cloak lined with duck, my ring...'  'Shut up!' shouted Geralt, pushing through the crowd on his horse. 'Shut up and get down  here you mutton head! Ciri, clear us a way! Dandelion! Did you hear what I said?'  'Geralt?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Come here! Jump up!'  They walked through the crowd and went into a gallop down a close alley. Ciri went first,  followed by Geralt and Dandelion riding Roach. 'What's the rush?' the bard asked from behind the Geralt. 'No one is persecuting us.'  'For now.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"My Ermine has a good heart.'  'Stop with the Ermine, dammit. You just got pardoned for insults against Her Majesty,  you don't want a recurrence.'  The troubadour was silent. Ciri stopped Kelpie and waited for them. When they arrived,  she saw Dandelion wiping tears from his eyes. 'Look at him,' she said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"It is true that she was unnerved when she caught me with the young  Baroness Nique... But surely she has calmed down, she will realise that I was not made for  monogamy. She'll forgive me and be waiting...'  'You are hopelessly stupid,' Geralt said and Ciri nodded vigorously to indicate she felt  the same way. 'I will not argue with you,' Dandelion said, offended. 'It's an intimate matter.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"You would not have seen her. She left shortly after your departure, In  January. She simply disappeared.'  'I did not mean her,' Geralt coughed, looking over at Ciri who was listening. 'I wanted to  see Reynart. To introduce him to Ciri...'  Dandelion bowed his head.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"It served the people as communication. The tree was  known as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 'Ciri, you start from that side,' Geralt ordered dismounting form his saddle. 'Dandelion  you look from the other side.'  The branches draped with tablets, swayed in the light wind and clattered and bumped into  each other. As was usual after a war, a lot of the messages were for missing family members.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Of  course, with that magical mare, she can travel three times faster than us. But even a magical  mare must need to rest. And Ciri's mysterious issue must be resolved. Come on, its  impossible...'  'For Ciri,' the Geralt cut him off, 'nothing is impossible.'  'But...'  'She is no longer the girl you knew,' Geralt did not let him finish. Dandelion was silent for a long time.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"I have come to  the conclusion that it would be stupid to risk it in defence of others..'  'I noticed,' Dandelion nodded. 'On one hand, it is smart. On the other...'  'There is no other.'  'Yennefer and Ciri,' Yarpen asked after a little while, 'have something to do with your  decision?'  'Much.'  'Then everything is clear,' Zoltan sighed. 'I have no clue how a master swordsman will  adapt to normal life. But, try as I might, I cannot see you planting cabbages, although I do  have respect for your choice...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Someone grabbed her, preventing her from falling on  the ground. She recognised Dandelion. 'It won't work,' said Ciri's voice, radiating despair. 'Your magic cannot cure him,  Yennefer.'  'We arrived...' Yennefer could barely move her lips. 'We're too late.'  'Your magic won't work, 'Ciri repeated as if she had not heard.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly. 'There is nothing more pathetic,' said Ciri sternly, 'than a sorceress in tears. You taught  me that. But now you're pathetic Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"They must understand.'  'They must.'  'Goodbye, Triss Merigold. Take care, Dandelion. Take care all.'  'Ciri,' Triss whispered. 'Little sister... Let me sail with you...'  'You do not know what you ask, Triss.'   'Will I ever see you...'  'Definitely,' she interrupted.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Dandelion
"Two female figures on a hill. Gulls circling above them, beneath them , on the  slopes of the hill, a procession of shadows. 'Ciri and Triss Merigold. The prophetic vision at Kaer Morhen.'  Smile, nod, step, another picture. A rider on a galloping horse, a misshapen double row of  alders, stretching out their arms their branches towards him.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"In the first dream he saw the Geralt Geralt or Rivia who occasionally visited mother  Nenneke. The Geralt sat motionless under icicles hanging from an overhanging rock and  was snowed in from a blizzard. In the second dream, Ciri was hunched over a horse's neck,  galloping towards a low wall of alders. Oh yes, and just before dawn he dreamed of Triss Merigold. After he last stay in the  temple the young man dreamed of the enchantress often.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"This is the work of sorceresses. But why would  it not be? Undoubtedly, it was written that Ciri would be Emhyr's wife, Queen of Cintra and  Empress of Nilfgaard. No doubt it was her destiny. Keep it this way, Triss Merigold thought happily.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Keep it this way, Triss Merigold thought happily. It is a good solution. Ciri will be safe. And eventually they'll forget her. They let her live.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"And though Yennefer had taught her all the names of the women she  would meet in this castle, Ciri immediately though of her as Lady Owl. 'We welcome you,' Lady Owl said. 'To the Lodge in Montecalvo, Ciri.'  Ciri bowed as instructed by Yennefer, politely, but without lowering her eyes modestly  like a maiden. It was answered with a sincere smile from Triss Merigold and a nod and a friendly look  from Margarita Laux-Antille. The looks from the other women where hard as augers.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"'We're here,' said Yennefer. 'Rivia. What a curious and entangled destiny.'  Ciri was excited and Kelpie kept dancing and shuffling on the edge of the road. Triss  Merigold sighed unnoticed. Rather, she believed it had been unnoticed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"'Please,' Yennefer looked at he. 'What strange sounds float from you beauteous breast,  Triss. Ciri, go out and see what lies ahead.'  Triss averted her face, determined not to give Yennefer any excuse. She sis not expect it  to work. For a long time she had been sensing Yennefer's anger and aggression growing  stronger as they approached Rivia.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Or is it that you think because I agreed to your request that I  want to have you with us? That I was interested in seeing you spend a meeting with an old  love? Ciri, I asked you to go on ahead. The two of us need to talk!'  'It is not a discussion, it is a lecture,' Ciri dared to argue, but under the threatening glare  from violet eyes, she immediately recoiled, clucked and galloped off on Kelpie on the road  ahead. 'You're not going to meet a loved one, Triss,' Yennefer continued.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Do  not count too much on fainting. He knows how to forgive.'  'He knows what was done to him, of course,' Yennefer narrowed her eyes. 'But he will  never forgive you for what was done to Ciri. And me.'  'It is possible,' Triss swallowed. 'He may not forgive.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"As of right now, right now! Oh I want to grab  you by your matted red hair...'  'Try it!' screamed Triss. 'Just try it, you vindictive bitch and I'll scratch out your eyes!' I...'  The both fell silent when they saw the cloud of dust as Ciri galloped back towards them. They immediately understood that something was happening. Even before Ciri had reach  them.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"'What is going on?'  'You know!' sobbed Triss, galloping at her side. 'Ride, Yennefer!'  They had ridden between the city's outskirts before they passed their first fugitives fleeing  from the city, Yennefer was bright enough to know what was happening in Rivia, no fire or  raid of troops, but a pogrom. She also knew what Ciri had sensed, what -and whom - she was  rushing too. She knew that she could not catch her. There was nothing she could do.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Frightened people had compacted into a crowd and she and Triss had to slow their  mounts to try and get through. Kelpie just jumped, the hooves of the horse knocking off a few  hats and caps. 'Ciri! Stop!'  Before they knew it, they were among the streets crowded with people running and  screaming. Yennefer, as she rode, saw bodies lying in gutters and noticed bodies hanging by  their legs from posts and beams.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"***    Geralt lay senseless, white as chalk. He lay motionless, but when they reached him, he  began to cough, and to spit blood. He began to shake and to tremble so violently that Ciri  could not hold him. Yennefer knelt beside him. Triss saw her hands shaking.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"'It won't work,' said Ciri's voice, radiating despair. 'Your magic cannot cure him,  Yennefer.'  'We arrived...' Yennefer could barely move her lips. 'We're too late.'  'Your magic won't work, 'Ciri repeated as if she had not heard. 'Is this what it is worth, all  of your magic?'  You're right, Ciri, Triss thought, feeling something catch in her throat. We can produce  hail, but we cannot ward off death.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly. 'There is nothing more pathetic,' said Ciri sternly, 'than a sorceress in tears. You taught  me that. But now you're pathetic Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"'I was hoping you'd come.'  The unicorn came closer, neighing again and digging his hooves into the hard  cobblestones. He lowered his head, the horn which sprang from his head suddenly blazed  with light, with a sheen that dispelled the fog. Ciri touched the horn. Triss gasped loudly when she saw the girl's eyes filled with white heat and her head  enveloped in a halo. Ciri did not hear her, did not hear anyone.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"The boat was on the shore, a few moments after the fog dissolved, Triss saw it clearly. It  was a tatty old barge, formless as a trough in a barn. 'Help me,' Ciri said, firmly and decisively. At first no one knew what the girl wanted help with. The poet was the first to understand.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Triss Merigold was sure that  she could smell the perfume of Lytta Neyd called Coral and in a haze of yellow-green her  eyes saw Coen of Kaer Morhen. These tricks were brought to their minds by the dense fog around Loc Eskalott. 'Ready, Ciri,' the sorceress said dully. 'You boat is waiting.'  Ciri brushed the hair from her forehead and sniffed. 'Apologise to the ladies at Montecalvo, Triss,' she said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"They must understand.'  'They must.'  'Goodbye, Triss Merigold. Take care, Dandelion. Take care all.'  'Ciri,' Triss whispered. 'Little sister... Let me sail with you...'  'You do not know what you ask, Triss.'   'Will I ever see you...'  'Definitely,' she interrupted.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"Those on the shore did not hear the slightest splash and  there was no movement in the water. It was as if it had disappeared, like a ghost. For a brief moment they saw the small silhouette of Ciri, they saw her sitting at the  bottom of the boat as it accelerated swiftly. And then there was only fog. She lied, thought Triss.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Triss
"We do not know if the Daisy of the Valley was  really as beautiful as they say. We do not know the appearance of Ida Emean. And the images  of the Sorceress of Nilfgaard were destroyed thoroughly and systematically, we have no idea  of the true appearance of Assire car Anahid or Fringilla Vigo.'  'Let us assume,' sighed Condwiramurs, 'that they looked as they were later portrayed. Dignified, noble, good, wise, honest and generous. And beautiful, dazzlingly beautiful...",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"Though neither her hair  nor crimson gown displayed excessive pomp and her little tiara and necklace were made not  of rubies, but modest, yet tasteful shells. Ida Emean, however, wore a dress of muslin and  chiffon, which was decorated in autumnal shades and so fine and light that it waved around in  the hardly noticeable breath of air the central heating produced like an anemone. Assire var Anahid aroused admiration, as usual in recent times, with her modest but  distinguished elegance. Over the small, narrow neckline of her dark-green dress, the  Nilfgaardian sorceress wore a gold chain and a single, gold framed emerald cabochon. Her  manicured nails, which were painted a very dark green, gave the composition a truly magical  touch of extravagance.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety. That it was,  she admitted. Perfectly sincere.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"I would not want us to miss a single word.'  The sorceresses, interrupting their gossip and quickly took their seats. Sile de Tansarville,  wore a silver boa, a feminine accent to her austere black outfit. Assire var Anahid was  dressed in a violet silk dress, which was graceful and combined simplicity and modest  elegance. Francesca Findabair was majestic as ever. Ida Emean aep Sivney was mysterious as  usual.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"She looked at Ida Emean the elf from the Blue  Mountains. 'Pro bono public...' she began, but did not finish. Assire nodded her head seriously,  indicating that she understood. 'What can we do?' she said slowly. 'Everything has its price.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"If Tissaia was among us she would not agree that in   order to maintain the unity of the Lodge it is necessary to use coercive methods or restriction  of personal freedom.'  'I vote for her,' said Francesca Findabair, adjusting the lace at her neckline. 'I have many  reasons, but I do not wish to explain them.'  'I vote for her,' said Ida Emean aep Sivney. 'So my heart dictates.'  'I'm against it,' Assire var Anahid said dryly. 'I do not decide out of lack of sympathy,  antipathy or principled reasons. I fear for her life.",The Lady of the Lake,Assire,Ida
"I wrote of this matter to my cousin Emhyr var Emreis. In my letter, I asked him  firmly to stop the senseless bloodshed. The war has ended and there has definitely been a  peace agreement.'  'Not so,' Geralt said calmly. 'Across the Yaruga roam sword and fire, blood is being  spilled. There is no indication that the war was to end.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"And resigned. ***    'You have come a long way,' repeated Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep  Morvudd, the White Flam Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies. I don't know,' Geralt said calmly, 'yours appears to have been longer, Duny.'  'You've recognised me,' the Emperor smiled. 'A lack of beard and a change of behaviour  changed me completely. The people who had seen me at Cintra, and came to Nilfgaard to  have audience with me, no longer recognised me.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"'And your impertinence is forcing  you to be even weaker. I invite you to sit in the presence of the Emperor. I grant you the  privilege of...life.'  Geralt, with relief, sat. Emhyr stood leaning against a carved cabinet. 'You saved my daughter's life,' he said.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"'It is clear that Ciri must never know who I really am. The secret must die. Along with  those who know it.'  'Sure' Geralt nodded. 'It could not be clearer.'  'You cannot help noticing,' Emhyr said after a moment, 'the hand of fate in everything  that has happened. All of it.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"Between us, Duny, how can you look her in the eyes?'  'The end justifies the means,' the Emperor said flatly. 'I do it for the future of the world. For its salvation.'  'If you have to save the world like this,' the Geralt lifted his head, 'this world would be  better off disappearing. Believe me, Duny; it would be better to perish.'  'You are weak,' Emhyr var Emreis said gently. 'Do not get excited, you look like you're  about to faint.'  He moved from the cabinet, pulled up a chair and sat down.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"The he pulled out a scroll tied with  snakeskin and acquainted me with the content. So I knew of the prophecy, I learned about  the future fate of the world and I realised what I must do. And I have come to believe that the  end justifies the means.'  'Of course.'  'Meanwhile, in Nilfgaard,' Emhyr ignored Geralt's comment, 'my business was on track. My supporter had gained more and more influence and had won a group of army officers and  cadets over to our side and prepared for a coup. However, I was also imperative.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"I survived only by a miracle,  caught in the rigging. I woke up and bandaged up. I had a broken arm and...'  'I wonder,' said the Geralt coldly, 'what a man fells after murdering his wife?'  'Worse than a mangy dog,' Emhyr replied promptly. 'I felt worse than a mangy dog, like  a true scoundrel. Even the fact that I never loved her didn't change that.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"perhaps Darn Rowan... I would not have killed her...'   'Even for the purpose that justifies the means?'  'Always,' the Emperor rubbed his forehead, 'you use a less drastic solution. There are  always many options available.'  'Not always,' said the Geralt, looking into his eyes. Emhyr avoided his gaze. 'Just what I thought,' Geralt nodded.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"It is the  price I must pay and you know it.'  'I know it.'  'You can spare Yennefer's life. She does not know the secret.'  'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri. And to avenge your  death.'  'True,' said the Geralt. 'I almost forgot how much she loves the girl. You're right, Duny.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"This  is not fair!'  'He who lives by the sword,' Emhyr var Emreis said dully,' dies by the sword. They both  fought with me and lost. But they lose with dignity.'  Ciri, in three steps stood before him, Geralt silently gasped. He heard Yennefer sigh. Bloody hell, he thought, anyone can see it!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"Remember, Ciri. You cannot!'  'Fear not, I didn't even think about it. You know, Geralt, I've had enough of killing. There has been all too much.'  'Too much. Goodbye, Geraltess.'  'Goodbye, Geralt.'  'Don't cry.'  'That is easy for you to say.'     ***    Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard escorted the Geralt and the sorceress to the  bath chamber, to a large marble bathtub filled with warm, fragrant water.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Emhyr
"The Geralt moaned, dropping more volumes to the floor with a kick from his leg. Fringilla leaned back and cried out, hitting with her heel a pile of books. A copy of  Reflections and Meditations for Every Day of the Year, an anonymous and interesting work,  somehow appeared on Geralt's back. Geralt read over her shoulder, finding out whether he wanted to or not, notes that had  been written by a doctor named Albertus Rivus, in a book called Academia Cintensis, printed  by the master typographer Johann Froben Junior in the second year of the reign of His  Majesty King Corbertt. Suddenly there was a silence in which only the faint sound of rustling apges could be  heard.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"When I was riding with Nightingale, in his Hanse, they said that  in winter along the mountain passes, on an enchanted horse, rides the King of the Mountain,  the ruler of the ice demons. To meet him face to face is certain death. What do you say,  Geralt? Is it possible...'  'Anything,' he interrupted her. 'Anything is possible in this company.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"The truth. as King Dezmod used to say, looking at the chamber pot after  relieving himself  The mind cannot comprehend this. '  'I suggest,' said Geralt, picking up a cup with a wry smile, 'to drink and change to topic of  conversation.'  'Right,' Zoltan and Dandelion said in unison. ***    Wirsing carried a third and forth platter of snails to the table. Not forgetting, of course,  the bread and vodka.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"Darkness ensued. And the darkness was filled with fangs, claws  and blood.'  Yarpen Zigrin stroked his beard, smearing grease from the snails through it. 'You speak well, Geralt,' he admitted. 'But, as young Cerro said to King Vridnak on their  first date  Does it have any practical uses? '  'There is no ground for the existence of Geralts,' Geralt did not smile, 'because the  struggle of Good and Evil takes place now in an entirely different field of battle in a  completely different way.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"I will go into retirement.'  'Is that right!'  'I'm serious. no more being a Geralt.'  There was a long silence, broken occasionally by the furious meows of the kittens as they  scratched at each other in a game. 'No more being a Geralt,' Yarpen Zigrin repeated. 'Ha! I don't know what to think about  that, as old King Dezmod said when caught cheating at cards.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"But i have a very bad feeling. Dandelion, you have travelled with him and spent a lot of time at his side. Has he shown  other symptoms of paranoia?'  'Okay, okay,' said Geralt with a stony face. 'No more jokes, as King Dezmod said when  all of his guests at a feast began to go livid and croak. I have said all that I had to say.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,King
"I know this story! When I was a child I heard this tale, from the old wandering storyteller... The Geraltess  Ciri... The scar on her cheek... The black mare, Kelpie...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"Geralt. I want Geralt. I really want Geralt. ***     'Oh no,' she cried. 'The devil take me!'  Kelpie neighed confirmed her felt the same way.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"I have these abilities, Ciri thought, such power. I'm the Lady of the Worlds but there is  no point! I wanted Geralt and I find myself lost in the wilderness, in winter in a blizzard. 'Come, Kelpie, move or you'll freeze!' she pulled on the reins with fingers that were  numb with cold. 'Come on, bullhead!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"People listened as if in a trance, captivated by the emphatic words of  the storyteller who told the story of the Geralt and the sorceress. The story of the Tower of  the Swallow. Of Ciri, the Geraltess with the scarred face. Of Kelpie, the magical black mare. Of the Lady of the Lake.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"***    They did not realise when May came. They first noticed at night time, when they saw the  bright, distance fires of Belleteyn. When Ciri, with strange excitement jumped onto Kelpie's  back and galloped towards the fires, Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the intimate  moment. After removing the necessary clothes, they made love on a sheepskin on the ground. They  made love urgently, in silence, without words.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"'The most popular post-war entertainment. What are the  reasons, Ciri?'  'For desertion, treason, cowardice before the enemy,' she recited fluently. 'And for  economic crimes.'  'Supplying the army with mouldy biscuits,' said the Geralt. 'During the war, an  enterprising merchant can easily get into trouble.'  'This does not look like the execution of a huckster,' Ciri pulled on Kelpie's reins,  submerging herself in the middle of the crowd, 'Look, the scaffolding is covered with cloth  and the executioner has a new, clean hood. He is executing someone important, perhaps a  noble.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"Goodbye.'  'Goodbye, Ciri.'  'In Rivia, in six days,' she insisted once again, turning Kelpie about. She kicked her into a gallop and was quickly out of sight. Geralt felt as if icy claws were  clawing at his stomach. 'Six days,' Dandelion repeated thoughtfully. 'From here to Vengerberg and then back to  Rivia...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"'He has come full circle,' said the girl, her eyes closed. 'e hurt me with the thorn from  Shaerrawedd, the snake Uroboros biting his own tail. I'm coming, Geralt! I'm coming to you! I will not leave you alone!'  Before the sorceresses were able to protest, she turned Kelpie and immediately went into  a full gallop.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Kelpie
"I heard neighing and galloping. I'd don't understand. Although if you  think about it...'  'Ciri.'  'What?'  'Do not think.'    ***    'Castle Stygga,' repeated Philippa Eilhart, looking out from under her long eyelashes at  Fringilla Vigo. Fringilla did not blush. IN the last three months she had been able to product a magic  cream which acted on blood vessels.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted. 'Have you forgotten to do something  about that, Philippa?'  'No, I have not forgotten.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"At the end of a long line of dark and dusty Cintran nobles, beyond the portrait of Cerbin,  Coram and Corbett, past, Dagorad and Roegner, beyond proud Calanthe and melancholy  Pavetta, hung the last portrait. It showed the reigning Empress, the heiress of the royal blood  and the crown. A slim girl with blond hair and sad eyes in a white dress with green sleeves –  Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra and Empress of Nilfgaard. Destiny, thought Philippa Eilhart, watching Dijkstra's eyes. Poor child, thought Dijkstra, looking at the portrait.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"He was going to stick a glass tube between my legs. If this is to be the fate that  awaits me, then thank you very much.'  Philippa's dark eyes blazed with frosty fury. But it was Sile de Tansarville that spoke next  to Ciri. 'You still have a lot to learn, girl,' she said, covering her neck with her silver fox boa. 'Many of the things you have seen and heard you will need to unlearn.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"Not a word! Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table. Ciri was not the only one to shrink and draw he head down between  her shoulders but other magicians of the Lodge as well, with maybe the exception of  Philippa, Francesca and Assire. And Yennefer. 'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"I'm done. Philippa, declare the girl's fate.'  'You are coming with me,' Lady Owl said, breaking the heavy silence, 'and Sile to Kovir,  to Pont Vanis, the summer capital of the kingdom. As you are no longer Ciri of Cintra,  during the course of the audience you will be presented as an adept of magic, being protected  by us. At that audience you will meet a very wise king, Esterad Thyssen. You will meet his  wife, the Queen Zuleyka, a person of singular nobility and goodness.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"'Yes,' she confirmed. 'First of all you must impress prince Tancred. because you are  going to become his lover and give him a child.'   'If you were still Ciri of Cintra,' Philippa continued after a long pause, 'still the  daughter of Pavetta and granddaughter of Calanthe, you would become Prince Tancred's  legal wife. You'd be the princess and later the queen of Poviss and Kovir. Unfortunately, and  I tell you with genuine regret, fate has deprived you of everything.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"Day and night. We will  show you how to stimulate that desire, but it is up to your to bear the fruit of our teachings.'  'All this is not important, at the end of the day,' said Lady Owl. 'The important thing is  that you get pregnant to Tancred as soon as possible.'  'Yeah, sure,' muttered Ciri. 'Yours and Tancred's child,' Philippa watched here with dark eyes, 'will ensure the future  and status of this Lodge. Take note that it will be a great thing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"However, it is impossible. We know that it is impossible. So we envy Yennefer.'  'Thank you, Lady Philippa,' Ciri said after a few moments, squeezing the head of the  sphinxes in her hands. 'I also feel honoured with the proposal to take the surname de  Tansarville. However, it seems to me that my new last name is the only thing that I can  choose for myself, I thank the two mistresses.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"And you know how sincere I can be with my envy.'  Yennefer thanked her with a gesture. Without a shadow of a smile. 'So,' Philippa said, 'all is taken care of.'  'No,' said Ciri. Francesca Findabair snorted quietly. Sile de Tansarville raised her head and her  expression hardened.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"It is for your own good, to learn discipline.'  'Therefore, let us resolve this issue,' said Philippa Eilhart, placing her hands on the table. 'Let each of us express our opinion. Should we allow this arrogant maid, Ciri, to travel to  Rivia? To meet with the Geralt, for whom there is no place in her life? Are we to allow this  sentimentality, which we will soon have to rid her of?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"I guess, I will finally make my vote.'  'Who do you vote, Philippa?' Sabrina frowned. Philippa Eilhart looked across the table. She met Ciri's green eyes and stared at them. ***    The bottom of the pond was a multicoloured mosaic, the coloured tiles appeared to move. Sitting on the pong creating shadows were the broad leaves of water lilies hiding goldfish.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"I will  take into account one more thing. An element that without balancing anything, balances  everything.'  Following her gaze, everyone looked at the wall, to a mosaic of many multicolour tiles  depicted the snake Uroboros, biting it's own tail. 'That thing,' she continued, staring with her dark eyes at Ciri, 'is destiny in which i,  Philippa Eilhart have only begun to believe in recently, which I have only recently begun to  understand. Destiny is not the way to providence or comfortable fatalism. Destiny is hope.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Philippa
"Apparently her night ride to her meeting with Geralt at the Halfling  Hofmeier's farm.'  The next picture, a dark oil painting. A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"What are the chances that some details  escaped the attention of historians and the researchers who fished in front of us? Do we even  have a minnow left?'   'They left,' Nimue said with conviction, combing her hair, 'Blank spaces filled with  rhetoric and fabrications. Or wrapped in silence.'  'Like what?'  'For example, the Geralt's winter stay in Toussaint. All version of the legend dispose of  this episode with a short sentence:  The heroes spent the winter in Toussaint. Even  Dandelion, who devoted two chapters to his adventures in the Duchy, is surprising enigmatic  in terms of the Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"***     'I think I know what the Geralt did during the winter in Toussaint.'  'Well, well,' Nimue looked over the edge of the leather-bound grimoire that she was  reading. 'So you finally dreamed something?'  'Of course' Condwiramurs said boastfully, 'I dreamed! Of the Geralt Geralt and a  woman with short, black hair and green eyes. I do not know who it could be. Maybe this  Countess, Dandelion writes about in his memoirs?'  'You must not have read carefully,' the sorceress said somewhat coolly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"I will not write about it. It  happened and that is enough, there is no reason to go breaking my head. To those who would  condemn the Geralt, remember that love has many names, judge not, lest ye be judged. Dandelion  Half a Century of Poetry    Those were the days of good hunting and good sleeping. Rudyard Kipling                                                         Chapter Three      The monster attacked from the darkness, from its hiding place, quietly and with  premeditation.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Prince Rajmund, to put it mildly, was dishonest, a villain, and forgive me,  a motherfucker, that would cause the devil himself an ulcer in six months. And Toussaint  suffered under his rule for seven years. But Duchess Anareitta is adored by the people.'  'So we do not have to worry,' Geralt asked sourly, 'that the deceased Prince Rajmund left  anyone who would honour him by putting a dagger into our friend, Dandelion?'  'You do not have to worry,' the Knight looked at him understandingly. 'On my honour,  nothing will happen to him. As I told you, Our Lady is devoted to the poet and Anarietta  would make mincemeat out of anyone who tried to harm him.'    The good knight returns,  When the war is over,  Not expecting his beloved,  Has now been married,  Hey, ho, ho,  That's the knight's fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'We'll bring you a quality brand and a good year. We can afford to, we've earned it. We can treat ourselves to our heart's content.'  'Of course,' Geralt said, waving to the innkeeper. 'Dandelion sometimes says that there  are other motivations for making money, but can never recall what. I want to taste what is  making those tempting smells from the kitchen.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"She is sitting in the chambers, which were prepared for you, and  does not want to move from there.'  'Why?'  'We'll talk about that later. Now come, the Duchess is waiting.'  'Right now?'  'That was her wish.'  The hall into which they entered was full of people as colourful as birds of paradise. Geralt did not have time to look around, because Dandelion pushed him towards a marble  dais on which stood two women, significantly differing from the surrounding society. It was quiet, but it grew quieter. The first of the women had a sharp, slightly raised nose and penetrating blue eyes that  seemed feverish.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Both were shrouded in long scarlet cloaks. 'Let the young come forward!'  The  young  were instructed in advance what to do. Dandelion went to the Duchess and  Geralt stepped out to meet the dark-haired companion, which he knew as Fringilla Vigo. Both women dropped their cloaks and the crowd rose in a thunderous ovation. Geralt  swallowed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"She  smelled of roses and amber. Her body was warm and soft. The women were brought to the vat, Geralt with Fringilla and the Duchess with  Dandelion and helped to stand up in the grape juice. The crowd roared. 'Ho, ho!'  Anarietta and Fringilla stood facing each other and laid their hands on each other's  shoulders to more easily maintain balance among the grapes, which rose to above their knees.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
'Let then ferment!'  Juice flowed and bubbled about the calves of the females. The chamberlain struck his staff on the pavement. Geralt and Dandelion approached and  help the women get out of the vat. Geralt saw Anarietta nibble on the troubadour's ear when  he lifted her in his arms. Her eyes glittered dangerously.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The gesture was as sincere  as it was exaggerated. It probably sounds like an absurd contradiction in terms, but trust me,  Reynart, it was precisely so.'    ***    'Oh, oh, oh,' sighed the Duchess Anna Henrietta, wringing her hands. 'Your story  distresses me, Mister Geralt. It seizes my heart with sadness.'  She sniffled her nose and reached out her hand, Dandelion at once placed a cambric  handkerchief embroidered with a monogram into it. The Duchess touched the handkerchief  lightly to her cheeks, so as not to remove her makeup.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The villains that  stalked you were crushed by my knighthood, so that none escape, so I have been briefed by  Viscount Julian. And one who dares cross your path better be careful. You are under my  protection.'  'I appreciate that,' Geralt swept another bow, and cursed his sore knee in spirit, and not  just his knee. 'However, I must not conceal what Viscount Dandelion has forgotten to tell  you. The rogues who chased me to Belhaven and the one that the brave knights beat in Caed  Myrkvid, were indeed rogues from the guild of illustrious rogues, but also wore the colour of  Nilfgaard.'  'And what of it?'  'Well, this was the tip of the force of Nilfgaardians that conquered Aedirn in twenty days,  and they could do the same to you Duchy in twenty minutes.'  'It is a war,' he insisted.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I want to assure you that at the  festive board, Her Highness has few places of honour and importance, therefor no one can  feel prejudice to the place allocated to him. But because here, in Toussaint, we pay special  attention to traditions and customs...'  'Get to the point, sir.'  'The banquet is tomorrow. I organise all guests according to their origin and status.'  'Sure,' the Geralt said seriously. 'The most important of us is Dandelion. Both in origin  and status.'  'Viscount Julian,' the Chamberlain said, wrinkling his nose, 'is an extraordinary guest of  honour.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The moon shone on the roofs, shining  like diamonds on the ice that hung from the eaves. Roach's horseshoes rang against the  pavement. Roach, thought the Geralt as he headed towards the palace of Beauclair, a graceful grey  mare, a gift from Anna Henrietta. And Dandelion. He urged his horse forwards.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"For some reason, they were always welcome and always  found something for them in the pots, pans or grills, usually bread, bacon, cheese or maybe  pickled mushrooms. They never missed a jar or two of red or white from the famous local  vineyards. They went there every morning for the two weeks they spent in Beauclair – Geralt, Regis,  Cahir, Milva and Angouleme. Only Dandelion had breakfast elsewhere. 'He,' Angouleme slathered some bread with butter, 'has his bacon brought to him in bed!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The poet wore a crimson beret as big as a loaf of  bread and was wearing a doublet of the same colour richly embroidered with gold thread. He   was sitting on a stool with his lute on his knees and his head was nodding carelessly in  answer to the flattery of the courtiers and ladies who circled around him. Anna Henrietta was thankfully not in sight, so Geralt unhesitatingly violated etiquette and  headed straight for him friend. Dandelion saw him coming, swelled and with an imperious  gesture said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, please leave us in private. Also the servants are allow to  leave.'  He clapped his hands and before the echo of his clap returned from the vaulted ceiling of  the hall, only the two of them stood there – and the smell of perfume, which hovered in the  air after the ladies left.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"And two wagons, loaded with  rations and feed. Can you ask for them from your Duchess? You have served long enough, I  hope?'  'No problem,' Dandelion tuned his lute not looking at the Geralt. 'But I'm surprised by  your haste. I would say it surprises me as much as your silly sarcasm.'  'My urgency surprises you?'  'Just so you know.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"I would say it surprises me as much as your silly sarcasm.'  'My urgency surprises you?'  'Just so you know. October is over and the weather deteriorates noticeably. Snow will be  falling in the passes any day now.'  'And you wonder at my hurry,' the Geralt nodded. 'But that reminds me, get more warm  clothing. Fur.'  'I thought,' Dandelion said slowly, 'that we would wait out the winter here.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Fur.'  'I thought,' Dandelion said slowly, 'that we would wait out the winter here. That we  would be here...'  'I you like,' Geralt said without thinking, 'you can stay.'  'Yes,' Dandelion put his lute aside and stood up. 'I think I will stay.'   The Geralt gasped audibly. He was silent. He looked at the tapestry, which depicted an  imaginary fight between a titan and a dragon.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I'm staying,' Dandelion repeated. 'I love Anarietta. And she loves me.'  Geralt remained silent. 'I will arrange the horses,' Dandelion promised. 'For you, I'll prepare a thoroughbred  mare named Roach, of course.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Or maybe the Prince Consort?'  'Formal and legal status doesn't mean anything to me,' Dandelion admitted frankly. 'But  you can't rule out anything. Marriage or not.'  Geralt was silent again, contemplating the titan's battle against the dragon. 'Dandelion,' he said finally. 'If you've been drinking, sober up quickly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Are you asking me to  reconsider it? Don't worry, I've thought about it. Anarietta loves me...'  'Have you ever heard a saying,' said Geralt, 'that princesses leap after love like hares? Even if Anarietta is not so frivolous, forgive my candour, it seems to me, that...'  'What?'  'That it is only in fairy tales that Duchesses marry musicians.'  'First of all,' snapped Dandelion, 'Even such an ignoramus like you should have heard of  morganatic marriages. Do I have to get out some examples from ancient and recent history?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Do I have to get out some examples from ancient and recent history? Secondly, it may surprise you, but I am not of an insignificances. My family, de Lettenhove,  are derived from...'  'I'm listening to you,' Geralt cut him off again, 'and I don't believe my own ears. Is this  really my friend Dandelion, who is speaking such crap? If it is indeed my friend, Dandelion,  has he lost all shred of reason?",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"And what is this  curious thing that I cannot see? Huh? What have I, according to you, closed my eyes too?'  'Most of all,' said the Geralt, 'that your chosen duchess is arrogant and ridiculous and  spoiled. She is a big child for whom you are nothing but a toy, which she will discard without  reproach as soon as a new musician appears with a fascinating new repertoire.'  'What you say is low and vulgar. I hope you realise?'  'I realise that you have gone completely mad, Dandelion.'  The poet was silent, stroking the neck of his lute.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"And I cannot give  it up. Is that supposed to be madness? I'd be a fool if I left.'  Geralt was silent as long as Dandelion had been before. 'Poetry,' he said. 'In that you have no equal.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'In that you have no equal. I do not have anything to say, you have  convinced me with your arguments. Farewell, Dandelion.'  'Farewell, Geralt.'    ***    The library of the palace was indeed huge. The room which housed it was at least twice  the size of the Knights Hall, where he had left Dandelion. The library had a glass ceiling,  through which sunlight poured.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"A charm that hangs over the whole valley. And now on this particular palace. I wondered about Dandelion, I wondered about Geralt, but  now it makes me kind of dizzy to be here and I feel a strange tingling... I've even found  myself... Fuck, what did I tell you!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"If so, I wish him all the best,  said Fringilla while gnawing on a goose bone. What is up with Dandelion? the Geralt said suddenly,  I haven't seen him for so long that  I draw all my knowledge of his activities from the satirical songs they sing in the city. We know no more than you. Regis smiled with his mouth closed.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch you. Don't tell me you're coming along with us now. No, Geralt  - Dandelion bowed his head -  I'm not coming along. I'm staying here in  Toussaint, with Weasel. That is, with Anarietta.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"take this. This will be my contribution. Dandelion  - Geralt took a bag from the poet -  we do not suffer lack of money. It isn't  necessary ... This will be my contribution,  repeated the troubadour.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Dandelions grew in the meadows and the trees  were white and fluffy and thick with flowers. The oak, too noble to rush, remained dark, but  on the edges, green leaves were beginning to show. ***    One night they spent under the open sky, they Geralt awakened from a nightmare. It  seemed as if he was paralysed and helpless, a great grey owl was clawing at his face and with  its sharp hooked beak, trying to peck his eyes out. He awoke.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"On the cart, trying to  maintain his balance with difficult was... 'Dandelion...' Ciri groaned. Geralt suddenly felt ill. Very ill. 'It's Dandelion,' Ciri said uneasily.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'It cannot be Dandelion,' he said flatly, staring at Roach's mane. 'It's him,' she said again. 'Geralt, we have to do something.'  'What,' he asked bitterly. 'Tell me what?'  The guard driving the cart treated Dandelion fairly, with surprising civility, without  brutality, even differentially, as much as they could afford. At the foot of the steps to the  gallows, they untied his hands.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'...according to the Supreme Court ruling of this County has been found guilty of all  crimes, offenses and misdeed of which he was accused, insulting Her Majesty, treason of the  state and dishonouring the establishment of the nobility through perjury, libel, and slander,  also for dissipation and indecency, furthermore, obscenity and whoredom. The Tribunal had  decided that Viscount Julian et cetera, et cetera, his receive the following punishment – First,  mortification of his coat of arms, a thick black line through his shield. Second, confiscation of  all his property, both movable and immovable, including lands, forests, castles and palaces...'  'Castles and palaces?' said the astonished Geralt. 'What?'  Dandelion snickered, making it blatantly clear what he thought of the judicial decree. 'Third, the maximum penalty...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"At the foot of the scaffold four ragged urchins held out a scarf to collect the blood in. There was a great demand for this type of souvenirs, and good money could be earned. 'Geralt,' Ciri said in a low voice. 'We have to so do something...'   He did not answer. 'I wish to speak to the people,' Dandelion said proudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Ciri, clear us a way! Dandelion! Did you hear what I said?'  'Geralt? Is that you?'  'Stop your questions and get down from there right now! Come here!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Come here! Jump up!'  They walked through the crowd and went into a gallop down a close alley. Ciri went first,  followed by Geralt and Dandelion riding Roach. 'What's the rush?' the bard asked from behind the Geralt. 'No one is persecuting us.'  'For now.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"When they arrived,  she saw Dandelion wiping tears from his eyes. 'Look at him,' she said. 'A viscount...'  'Let's go,' the Geralt urged. 'Let's get out of this town and out of the borders of this  lovely country. While there is still time.'    ***    When they were almost to the border of Toussaint, in sight of the mountain Gorgon, And  official overtook them.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
The bypassed  Belhaven. They camped in the valley of Newi. In a place that the Geralt and the bard remembered  well. Dandelion lasted a long time without asking questions. But finally they had to tell him everything.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"At the crossroads gallows were laden with corpses. They passed through towns on their way towards Dol Angra. 'Dandelion,' Geralt just now noticed what he should have noticed a while ago. 'Your  priceless tube! Your memoirs.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"It is true that she was unnerved when she caught me with the young  Baroness Nique... But surely she has calmed down, she will realise that I was not made for  monogamy. She'll forgive me and be waiting...'  'You are hopelessly stupid,' Geralt said and Ciri nodded vigorously to indicate she felt  the same way. 'I will not argue with you,' Dandelion said, offended. 'It's an intimate matter.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"You would not have seen her. She left shortly after your departure, In  January. She simply disappeared.'  'I did not mean her,' Geralt coughed, looking over at Ciri who was listening. 'I wanted to  see Reynart. To introduce him to Ciri...'  Dandelion bowed his head.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"It served the people as communication. The tree was  known as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 'Ciri, you start from that side,' Geralt ordered dismounting form his saddle. 'Dandelion  you look from the other side.'  The branches draped with tablets, swayed in the light wind and clattered and bumped into  each other. As was usual after a war, a lot of the messages were for missing family members.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"They found there tablets containing philosophical considerations – either incomprehensible,  absurd, obscene or disgusting. 'Hey,' Dandelion called. 'The castle of Rastburg needs a Geralt. They offer great  rewards. Comfortable accommodation and delicious meals are provided.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Goodbye.'  'Goodbye, Ciri.'  'In Rivia, in six days,' she insisted once again, turning Kelpie about. She kicked her into a gallop and was quickly out of sight. Geralt felt as if icy claws were  clawing at his stomach. 'Six days,' Dandelion repeated thoughtfully. 'From here to Vengerberg and then back to  Rivia...",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"But even a magical  mare must need to rest. And Ciri's mysterious issue must be resolved. Come on, its  impossible...'  'For Ciri,' the Geralt cut him off, 'nothing is impossible.'  'But...'  'She is no longer the girl you knew,' Geralt did not let him finish. Dandelion was silent for a long time. 'I have a strange feeling...'  'Be quiet.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I have a vague feeling, said Dandelion, 'that something is not as it should be. There's  something missing... Do you have the same feeling, Geralt?'  'Huh?'  'Something here is not normal.'  'Nothing here is normal, Dandelion. Nothing.'    ***    It was a hot night, black, with no wind, lit by only distant flashes of lightning and upset  by the rumour of thunder. Geralt and Dandelion camped and watched the horizon to the west   glow red with fires.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"And snippets of sound. They heard women crying and the wailing of children and the sound of their murderers  howling. Dandelion did not say anything, but kept throwing glances at the Geralt. But the Geralt  did not move, did not even turn his head. His face was like stone.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Many of the women and children passing in front of them moved like puppets, with  empty eyes, swollen faces and bruised bare legs showing through torn skirts. Some had to be  supported as they walked. Dandelion looked at Geralt's face and began to panic. 'It's time to be on our way,' he muttered. 'Farewell, gentlemen.'  The young officer did not even turn his head, intrigued by monitoring the refugees.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The column meandered slowly to the south. From somewhere behind them they heard a  high, desperate scream from a female. 'Geralt, no,' Dandelion whispered. 'Do not interfere, stay out of it...'  The Geralt turned and looked at the poet as if he did not know him. 'Meddle in it?' he shrugged.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Save someone? Give my life for noble principles and  ideals? No, Dandelion, not anymore.'     ***    On a restless night, illuminated by lightning, the Geralt again awakened from a dream. This time he was not sure if it was one hideous nightmare or if it was a series of nightmares. Again, over the remains of the fire a light arose, pulsating and frightening the horses.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'Destiny has brought us here again,  the circle has closed. I don't see the blue and white banner on the castle towers, so Queen  Meve must not be present. I don't think that she has forgiven your desertion...'  'Believe me, Dandelion,' Geralt interrupted him, guiding his horse down the slope. 'I do  not care if she has forgiven me or wont forgive me...'  Next to the city, near the entrance gate, stood a colourful tent reminiscent of a cake. In  front of the tent, on a pole, hung a white shield with a red chevron.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Under the raised part of  the tent stood a king in full armour and a white tabard the same as the shield. The knight,  with a penetrating and challenging look, stared at the women passing by before him with  sacks of coal, charcoal, deadwood and barrels of pitch. Upon seeing Geralt and Dandelion  approach on horseback, his eyes lit up with hope. 'The Lady of your heart,' Geralt thwarted the hopes of the knight with a chilling voice,  'whoever she is, is the most beautiful and virtuous of all women from the Yaruga to the  Buina.'  'On my honour,' the knight reluctantly answered. 'You speak the truth, sir.'    ***    A blond girl in a silver studded, leather jacket vomited in the middle of the street, bent in  half, holding the stirrup of a grey mare.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The mare snorted and  shied, so the girl fell to the ground landing in her own vomit. 'What are you staring at, asshole?' yelled one of the colleagues. 'White hair!'  'Geralt,' whispered Dandelion. 'Please don't do anything stupid.'  'Don't worry.'  They tied their horses to the berth at the front of the inn. The young men were ignoring  them, busy shouting at a townswoman passing down the road with a child.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"In these times it is easy to get fleeced in the dwarven quarter. Just...'  'Just what?'  'Just nothing. This is not my thing.'  'Come on, Geralt,' said Dandelion to the Geralt, he had started to notice the war orphans,  those not completely drunk, eyes begin to glitter with the use of fisstech. 'Goodbye, innkeeper. Who knows, maybe someday I'll visit your business.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Two boys and a girl in black leather jackets. With swords on  their backs. Geralt did not slow, he walked towards them, his face and eye were cold and completely  indifferent. The young people at the very last moment, parted and retreated. Dandelion noticed the  stench of beer.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Sweat. And fear. 'They have to get used to it,' the Geralt said as they entered the street. 'They have to  adapt.'  'Sometimes it is difficult.'  'This is not an argument, Dandelion.'  The air was hot, stick and as thick as soup. ***     Outside, in front of the inn, two young men in black jackets helped the blond girl wash in  the horse trough.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
The name has been recorded in the annals. And went  down in history. But Geralt and Dandelion did not know this yet. Nor did the girl. ***    The streets of Rivia were alive with a great buzz and what appeared to be locals  completely absorbed visiting traders.,The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"It seemed that everyone there traded everything, trying  to change one thing for something else. From everywhere came the cacophony of sound of  products being advertised, fierce haggling and from both sides the sounds of people being  accused of fraud, theft, chicanery and other sins which had nothing to do with trade. Before coming to the Elms district, Geralt and Dandelion received many intrusting  proposals. Offered to them was, among other things - a astrolabes, a tin trumpet and  decorative cutlery adorned with the Frangipani family crest, shares in a copper mine, a jar of  leeches. a tattered tome entitled The Miracle or Head of Medusa, a pair of breeding ferrets, an  elixir to increase potency and even - for a negotiated price - a not too young, not too thin, and  not very clean bride.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"It was the first on the street and the saw it with  ease. The porch was covered in climbing roses, and under the roof overgrown with moss,  where a swallows nests hung, were two dwarves. 'Geralt and Dandelion,' said one of the dwarves belching loudly. 'You, rogues have come  as expected.'  Geralt dismounted. 'Hail, Yarpen Zigrin.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"He returns  from the end of the world, where he, if you believe the rumours, waded through blood, killed  dragons and overthrew an empire. And he asks, how we are going. The same Geralt.'  'What smells so good?' Dandelion said, sniffing. 'Lunch,' Yarpen Zigrin said. 'Meat.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Think of in how many  you heard the barking of dogs.'  'Bloody hell,' Dandelion slapped his forehead. 'I saw... I told you, Geralt, it was not  normal! That something was missing! Ha!",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The vodka was cold and her their teeth. Dandelion went first, with his flowery style, colourful language and embellishments on  the story full of nonsense and lies. Then the Geralt spoke. He told the pure truth, and spoke  dry and monotonously. Dandelion could not stand it and interrupted again and again which  earned him reprimands from the dwarves.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"And let their names live on long in songs and stories. Let's drink.'  'Let's drink,' echoed Dandelion and Yarpen. Let's drink, thought the Geralt. ***    Wirsing, a grey-haired man, pale and skin as a stick, a veritable denial of a stereotypical  innkeeper and master of the culinary mysteries, deposited on the table a basket of white  fragrant bread and a platter of snails, sizzling in garlic and spices on a bed of radish leaves. Dandelion, Geralt and the dwarves dug in quickly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Ah, hell, enough of  this! Let's drink. and hurry up with those snail, because Wirsing is coming over with another  pan.'    ***    The dwarves, with belts unbuckled, listened to Geralt's story of Dandelion's aristocratic  romance, that ended on the gallows. The poet seemed offended and did not comment. Zoltan  and Yarpen almost spilt apart with laughter.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"The truth. as King Dezmod used to say, looking at the chamber pot after  relieving himself  The mind cannot comprehend this. '  'I suggest,' said Geralt, picking up a cup with a wry smile, 'to drink and change to topic of  conversation.'  'Right,' Zoltan and Dandelion said in unison. ***    Wirsing carried a third and forth platter of snails to the table. Not forgetting, of course,  the bread and vodka.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"But i have a very bad feeling. Dandelion, you have travelled with him and spent a lot of time at his side. Has he shown  other symptoms of paranoia?'  'Okay, okay,' said Geralt with a stony face. 'No more jokes, as King Dezmod said when  all of his guests at a feast began to go livid and croak. I have said all that I had to say.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"I'll no longer need it.'  'Quickly,' Yarpen said. 'Pour vodka into him, Dandelion, because he is talking like an old  Schrader when he fell into the mine shaft on his head. Geralt, I know you've a deep  temperament and a sensitive soul, but do not talk such crap, as you can see, Yennefer is not  here, just us old wolves. Don't tell us old wolves stories of a Geralt not needing a sword, the  world is not like that. You are a Geralt and you will need...'  'No, I won't,' Geralt gently denied.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Do you want her to be a widow before the  wedding?'  The argument worked. The dwarves ran to the cellar. Geralt and Dandelion hid the  entrance with a rug. Wirsing, usually pale, was as white as buttermilk. 'I saw a pogrom in Maribor,' he stammered, looking at the entrance of the cellar.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'I saw a pogrom in Maribor,' he stammered, looking at the entrance of the cellar. 'If they  find them there...'  'Go to the kitchen.'  Dandelion was also pale. Geralt was not surprised. Until recently it was a formless and  monotonous roar but now they could pick out individual voices. The sound of them lifted the  hair on his head.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Three dwarves - a man and two women - ran towards the inn. The roaring crowd raced  after them. Geralt took a deep breath. He stood up. Feeling the terrified eyes of Dandelion and  Wirsing, he removed from the shelf above the fireplace, Sihil, the Mahakam sword forged in  the foundry of Rhundurina itself.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"Feeling the terrified eyes of Dandelion and  Wirsing, he removed from the shelf above the fireplace, Sihil, the Mahakam sword forged in  the foundry of Rhundurina itself. 'Geralt...' Dandelion moaned in a heartbreaking tone. 'Very well,' said the Geralt, walking towards the exit. 'But this is the last time! Damn  me, but it really is the last time!'  He went out onto the porch, then jumped off it and cut a hulking man in a masonry  smock, then a woman that threatened him with a shovel.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"'We sent for physician,' said a dwarf standing next to Dandelion, in a husky voice,. 'but  he has not appeared...'  'it is too late for a doctor,' Triss said, surprising herself that her voice sounded so calm. 'He is dying.'  Geralt continued to stir, coughing blood, then becoming very tense and froze. Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly.",The Lady of the Lake,Geralt,Dandelion
"When Commander Duke de Wett  learned of the disaster at Brenna and the news reached him that Foltest and John Natalis had  ordered a forced march, he immediately sounded a retreat and in panic fled across the river  to Cintra and escaping significant losses to his troops, because word had gotten around  about Nilfgaard's defeat and a new rebellion was rising in force in Verden. Only troops  remained in the forts of Nastrog, Rozrog and Bodrog and after the Peace of Cintra they  emerged with honour with banners aloft. Meanwhile, in Aedirn, the news of what happen at Brenna caused the antagonised Kings  Demavend and Henselt to join together in arms against Nilfgaard's East Group Army, which  was led by Duke Ardal aep Dahy into the Pontar valley, unable to resist the combined forces  of the two kings. With the addition of the strength of the troops from Redania and the  guerrilla squads of Queen Meve, who undertook combat actions in the rear of the enemy,  they forced Nilfgaard to Aldersberg. Ardal aep Dahy prepared for battle, but due to fate he  suddenly became serious ill, perhaps from spoiled food he got colic and diarrhoea and two  days later died in pain.",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"Foltest, King of Temeria and his vassal, King Venzlav of Brugge. Demavend, King of Aedirn. Henselt, King of Kaedwen. Ethan, King of Cidaris. The young King Kistrin of Verden.",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"And the Earl Dijkstra. We should seek to get rid of this spy and remove him from the table of discussions, thought the hierarch. King Henselt and King Foltest, and even young King Kistrin, have already allowed themselves a few sour comments to our Nilfgaardian representatives. This Sigismund Dijkstra is a person of dubious origins with an unacceptable past and reputation. We cannot afford to have such a person distorting the atmosphere of the deliberations.",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"Success  in negotiation is based on concessions obtained. Something is given, something is lost. In  other words, in order to buy something, something must be sold.'  'Indeed,' the pilgrim said after a moment, 'Something so plain and obvious can be  understood by even the simplest of men.'    ***    'No, no, a thousand times, no!' cried King Henselt, smashing his two fists into the  tabletop, overturning his drink and making the inkwell jump. 'I will not hear any more  discussions about it! No more haggling!",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"And do not embarrass  us by screaming in front of His Excellency.'  Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the negotiator on behalf of the Empire of Nilfgaard, bowed with a  false smile, that suggested that the antics of the King of Kaedwen did not irritate or ultimately  interest him. 'Are we going to start attacking each other,' continued Foltest, 'like a pack of rabid dogs? Shame on you, Henselt.'  'We have made arrangements with Nilfgaard in the thorny matter of Dol Angra,' said  Dijkstra. 'It would be foolish...'  'I resent such comments!' roared Henselt so loud he could have competed with a buffalo. 'I resent such rude comments, particularly from some fucking spy!",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"I am the fucking anointed  King!'  'It can't be seen at first glance,' Meve muttered. Demavend, turned away from looking at the shields on the rooms walls, smiling with  distain, as if not concerned about the future of his kingdom. 'Enough!' wheezed Henselt, his eyes rolling. 'Enough, by the gods. As I said, I won't  give up an inch of land.",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"By the gods, is it to be the  face of crime and looting? Should it be maintained in the lawless status quo? Should stolen  goods remain in the hands of thugs and robbers?'  Henselt grabbed a map from the table, tore it in two and with a rapid movement threw it  at Demavend. The King of Aedirn did not even move. 'My armies,' Henselt spluttered, his face turning the colour of a well aged wine, 'won the  Marches from the Nilfgaardians.",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"The army of  Kaedwen, which breached my boarders as an aggressor and occupier, has one week to leave  the fortresses and castles that they have illegally occupied in Upper Aedirn. That is the  condition for me to continue to take part in these negotiations. And verba volant, my  secretary will add an official protocol in that sense.'  'Henselt?' Foltest gave him a questioning look. 'Never!' bellowed the King of Kaedwen, overturning his chair and jumping like a  chimpanzee stung by a hornet. 'I will never give up the Marches!",The Lady of the Lake,Henselt,King
"A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele.

'Well done,' Nimue praised.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And  she would not eat with her hands, she was eager to show her superiority to Vilgefortz and the  rest of the guests of the sorcerer. She knew none of them. 'It is with great regret I must inform you,' said Vilgefortz, his fingers caressing the stem  of his cup, 'that Ciri, your ward, has departed from this world. You can only blame yourself,  Yennefer. And your foolish stubbornness.'  One of the guests, a short man with dark hair, sneezed loudly, wiping snot on a cambric  handkerchief.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"The report of the girl's death has crushed me like you, if not more. After all I had far- reaching plans for her, which would decide about my future. Ciri is dead and now my plans  have collapsed.'  'Good,' Yennefer, barely keeping the knife in your fingers, clumsily cut into her second  course of stuffed pork chop. 'On the contrary,' continued the sorcerer, 'to you Ciri was only a silly sentiment,  consisting of equal parts of the penalty of your infertility and your guilt. Yes, yes, Yennefer, a  sentiment of guilt!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'I'm sorry to spoil your good humour, my dear,' said the wizard coldly. 'Because I have  the sad news that the Geralt, Geralt of Rivia is also dead. Yes, Yes, the same Geralt Geralt,  with whom, as with Ciri, you associated your surrogate feelings, foolish, embarrassing and  nauseating to the stomach. Know Yennefer that our dear friend, the Geralt, said goodbye to  the world in a truly fiery spectacular. On this occasion, you should not have any remorse.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'I would be nice that you remember this name, witch. That you engrave it in your memory.'  'Go fuck yourself, pig.'  'I am a bounty hunter,' he growled. 'Three months ago, in September, I caught your little  bastard in Ebbing – the famous Ciri, which you were talking about.'  Yennefer listen carefully. September. Ebbing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Then they fought fiercely for the whip they both were holding. Yennefer. she said quickly,  The one whose name you've mentioned a few times to me at  night, in moments of ecstasy, has not ever betrayed you or Ciri. She was not an accomplice to  Vilgefortz. She fearlessly undertook an unprecedented risk to save Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"She had enough of her own concerns. ***    The tops of the hills were crowned with menhirs and dolmens. The sight of them  reminded Ciri of the stone in Ellander, where Yennefer had taught her magic. Oh, that was a  long time ago, she thought. Centuries ago...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Exactly so. The motherland calls. And partly for personal reasons.'  'Ciri, do not fall asleep in the saddle,' Yennefer said. 'We have arrived.'  The had arrived at a city, where the doors and gates of the houses had painted white  crosses on the. They rode into a dense, suffocation smoke, coming from the bodies of the  dead who were being burned.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And I feel robbed. Robbed  of the possibility of committing follies. I cannot go madly hurrying after Ciri to help her, I  cannot run like crazy to save Geralt and Yennefer. Not only that, there is a war, which you  have sent your girls... A war, that Jarre fled to and I am refused the possibility to even stand  on a hill.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"It was brightly lit, clean, equipped with long tables with metal plates and  shelves full of glass – flasks, test tubes, retorts, bowls and all sorts of other gadgets. As in Ellander it also smelled strongly of alcohol, ether, formalin and something else,  something that inspired terror. Even there, in the friendly temple, opposite the friendly  priestess Nenneke and Yennefer, Ciri felt fear in the laboratory. And there, in Ellander, no  one dragged her into the lab by violence; nobody held her arms in an iron grip. There, in  Ellander, was no steel chair, whose shape was sadistically quite obvious.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Once you have developed a placenta, I'll remove it. The rest of  my plans and intentions, as you can understand, do not concern you, so there is no use in  giving you useless information.'  He made a theatrical pause. Ciri could not stop her lips from trembling. 'And now,' the wizard gestured with a flourish, 'I invite you to your chair, princess.'  'It would be worth it,' Bonhart sneered under his grey moustache, 'to see the look on that  bitch, Yennefer's face. She deserves it.'  'Of course,' Vilgefortz wiped bubbly foam from his lips again.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And Yennefer is something like a  mother to her. In all primitive cultures, mothers of the bride are present at this ritual. Quickly  bring Yennefer here!'  'With regard to the fertilization,' Bonhart said bending over Ciri, who the sorcerer's  minions had already started to undress, 'would it not be possible to do it the old, proven way,  Lord Vilgefortz? In accordance with nature?'  Skellen snorted and shook his head. Vilgefortz frowned.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'I'm really impressed, Geralt. You are hopelessly naive  and stupid, but your technique is really impressive.'  'Your underlings,' Yennefer said calmly, 'just took off and left you. Give us Ciri and we'll  leave you alone.'  'You know, Yennefer,' sneered the wizard, 'that is the second generous offer I've had  today? Thank you, thank you. And here is my answer...'  'Look out!' Yennefer screamed and jumped.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'But it's not the first I've seen.' Can you walk?'  'With your help, yes.'    ***    They met in a place where the corridors came together to form and arch. They met under  the dead eyes of the statues. 'Ciri,' the Geralt said, rubbing his eyes. 'Ciri,' Yennefer said, supported by the Geralt. 'Geralt,' Ciri said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Fix  your hair! Don't slouch. Come to me.'  Ciri walked, stiffly over to Yennefer. Yennefer smoothed her collar and tried to wipe the  dried blood from her sleeve. She fixed her hair, revealing the scar on her cheek.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And a great  desire to be done with it all. 'Mummy.'  'My daughter.'  'Let's go,' Geralt decided to interrupt, but only after a long time. Ciri sniffed noisily and wiped her nose with the back of her hand. Yennefer scolded her  with a look and rubbed one of her eyes. Surely she had gotten a speck of powder in them.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Let's go,' he repeated. 'Yes,' said Yennefer. 'I want to see the sky.'  'I'll never leave you again,' Ciri said dully. 'Never again.'  'Let's go,' said Geralt. 'Ciri help Yen.'  'I don't need help!'  'Let me help you, mother.'  Before them was a staircase.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"We have no choice, girl. Yen wants to see  the sky. And I want to see the sky, Yen and you.'  Ciri looked at Yennefer, who if not for the railing she was leaning against, would have  fallen down. She pulled out the medallions she took from Bonhart. The cat she hung around  her neck, the wolf she gave to Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"But they did not throw down their  swords. They carefully placed them on the steps. Geralt felt the warmth from Ciri's arm and  could hear her breathing. Above, avoiding the corpses and spilled blood, came Yennefer. She showed the soldiers  her empty hands and sat down heavily on the step next to Geralt and Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"At least you spared the hangman some work. You have  travelled a long way, Geralt.'  Geralt did not respond. Ciri sniffed again and wiped her nose on the back of her hand. Yennefer again scolded her with her eyes. The Nilfgaardian noticed it and smiled.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"During that time, please provide all available services and convenience to both ladies. Obviously under the constant watch of guards.'  'As you wish, Your Majesty!'  'Geralt, follow me, please.'  The Geralt rose. He looked at Ciri and Yennefer, wanting to calm them, wanting to  warning them not to try any nonsense. But it was not needed – they were both extremely  tired. And resigned.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"You have no  other way out. There are no other solutions. If I escape from prison I'll come for Ciri. It is the  price I must pay and you know it.'  'I know it.'  'You can spare Yennefer's life. She does not know the secret.'  'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"She has quite a rebellious nature.'  'I know.'    ***    Yennefer agreed without hesitation. 'Full circle,' she said, staring speculatively at her wrist. 'Uroboros is biting his own tail.'     ***    'I don't understand,' Ciri spluttered like an angry cat, 'I don't see why I should go with  him! Why? Where are you going?'  'My daughter,' Yennefer said quietly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"This  is not fair!'  'He who lives by the sword,' Emhyr var Emreis said dully,' dies by the sword. They both  fought with me and lost. But they lose with dignity.'  Ciri, in three steps stood before him, Geralt silently gasped. He heard Yennefer sigh. Bloody hell, he thought, anyone can see it!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"When you sleep,  I'll bite through your throat...'  The Emperor with a quick gesture silenced the murmuring of his officers. 'This will happen,' he drawled, not taking his eyes from Ciri, 'as intended. Say goodbye  to your friends, Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon.'  Ciri looked at the Geralt, Geralt made a dismissive motion with his head. The girl  sighed. She hugged Yennefer and whispered together for a long time.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"They took all the  prisoners, mounted their horses and left. They left no one behind.'  'They left no one?'  'Nobody.'  'Incomprehensible,' Geralt shook his head. 'I don't understand it.'  'And nothing happened,' Yennefer cleared her throat, 'to explain this?'  'No,' Ciri replied quickly, 'nothing.'  She lied. ***    At first, she had tried to appear fine. Erect, proud, head held high and her face impassive,  while being pushed into the gloved hands of the Black knights, while throwing bold and  challenging looks and those helmets which made her so afraid.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And she, shaking and crying uncontrollably, let him. 'A strange thing, fate,' she heard him whisper faintly. 'Goodbye, my daughter.'    ***    'What did he say?'  Ciri's face clouded. 'He said, Va Faill, luned. In the elder speech – Goodbye, my daughter.'  'I know,' Yennefer nodded.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted. 'Have you forgotten to do something  about that, Philippa?'  'No, I have not forgotten.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"After all, the princess  was already pregnant and Ciri was born less than eight months later... Ciri, the heiress to the  throne, the young lion with the Lioness's blood... Ciri, my little sister. Who is now apparently  far away to the south. Fortunately, no longer alone, she is with Geralt and Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer was silent. Yennefer was often silent lately. 'Now,' Ciri said quietly, 'we go to a village call Unicorn. The name comes from the straw  unicorn that protects the town. A poor and ridiculous puppet.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"I would like that, as a reminder  of what happened there, the inhabitants have... if not valuable, at least a more dignified idol. I  would like to ask for your help, Yennefer, because without magic...'  'Sure, Ciri. What next?'  'The Pereplut Swamps. I am confident that I will be able to...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"I will remember the look in their eyes. I hope that the memory of those eyes will protect me  from similar mistakes. Do you understand, Geralt?'  'I understand, Ciri,' Yennefer said. 'Both of us, we understand you very well, my dear. Let's go.'    ***    The horses ran as if carried by the wind of a magic storm.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"***    They did not realise when May came. They first noticed at night time, when they saw the  bright, distance fires of Belleteyn. When Ciri, with strange excitement jumped onto Kelpie's  back and galloped towards the fires, Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the intimate  moment. After removing the necessary clothes, they made love on a sheepskin on the ground. They  made love urgently, in silence, without words.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"This time for real. ***    The next day Yennefer confirmed his fears. After a long meeting, which they excluded  Ciri from. 'I'm leaving,' she said dryly. 'I have to.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Now instead of nodding, give me a hug and kiss.'  He obeyed. One way or another, he loved her. ***    'Now where?' Ciri asked, she had barely spoken since Yennefer had disappeared with a  flash through her portal. 'The river...' Geralt coughed, conquering the pain under his breast bone. 'The river in  front of us is called the Sansretour.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"***    On the twenty-sixth of May they crossed the Yaruga on a new, white resin scented bridge. Remnants of the old bridge, black, burnt, charred piles were still visible in the water and on  the shore. Ciri began to get restless. Geralt knew why. He knew her intentions, her plans and arrangement with Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Two other women were there, standing calmly. One black and white and the other black  and grey. Yennefer and Ciri. The Geralt moaned in his sleep. ***    Yennefer was right when she did not allow her to wear male clothing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Ciri would have  felt foolish dressed as a boy among these elegant ladies. She was glad that she gave in to the  combination of black and grey, it flattered her and she could fell the approval when they saw  the puffy sleeves and clinched waist and the small brooch in the shape of a rose. 'Come closer please.'  Ciri shivered slightly. It was not just the sound of the voice. Yennefer, as it turned out,  was right about her neckline.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Yennefer, as it turned out,  was right about her neckline. Ciri had insisted thought, and now she had the impression that  she could feel a draft on her breast all the way down to her navel, and was covered in goose  bumps. 'Closer still,' said the dark-haired and dark-eyed woman whom Ciri remembered from the  island of Thanedd. And though Yennefer had taught her all the names of the women she  would meet in this castle, Ciri immediately though of her as Lady Owl. 'We welcome you,' Lady Owl said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Only her. You,  Yennefer, are not an invited guest, but are summoned to be tried and punished as a  wrongdoer. You'll stand for as long as it takes the Lodge to decide your fate.'  In a twinkling of an eye, Ciri ended protocol. 'In that case, I will stand also,' she said in a loud voice. 'I have not come as a guest.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"But the unity of the Lodge and its interests are most important. The Lodge is everything,  the rest is nothing. I hope you understand, Ciri?'  'Perfectly,' Ciri said, not looking away from her gaze. 'Especially since I am supposed to  be the nothing.'  The beautiful queen of the elves, Francesca Findabair laughed. 'Congratulations, Yennefer,' she said in her hypnotically deep and melodious voice.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Her death,  however, was a turning point. Now is a new time and big changes are coming. You, Ciri, you  were once Princess Ciri of Cintra, but fate has now given you a different role. Surely you  already know what it is.'  'I know,' said Ciri, not listening to the warning hiss from Yennefer. 'Vilgefortz explained  it to me!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Not a word! Do not dare open your mouth while Sile de Tansarville speaks.'  The sorceress from Kovir voice was sharp and penetrating as a knife scratching on iron,  and hung over the table. Ciri was not the only one to shrink and draw he head down between  her shoulders but other magicians of the Lodge as well, with maybe the exception of  Philippa, Francesca and Assire. And Yennefer. 'You are right,' said Sile, adjusting the boa around her neck again, 'you were called to  Montecalvo to meet your fate.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"However, it is impossible. We know that it is impossible. So we envy Yennefer.'  'Thank you, Lady Philippa,' Ciri said after a few moments, squeezing the head of the  sphinxes in her hands. 'I also feel honoured with the proposal to take the surname de  Tansarville. However, it seems to me that my new last name is the only thing that I can  choose for myself, I thank the two mistresses.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And you know how sincere I can be with my envy.'  Yennefer thanked her with a gesture. Without a shadow of a smile. 'So,' Philippa said, 'all is taken care of.'  'No,' said Ciri. Francesca Findabair snorted quietly. Sile de Tansarville raised her head and her  expression hardened.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"And  when I'm done I will come back here, to Montecalvo, and come before this Lodge and  discuss what has been decided.'   Sile moved her lips, as if she had noticed a bad taste in her mouth and wanted to sit it out  immediately. But she remained silent. 'I have to meet,' continued Ciri, 'with the Geralt Geralt in the city of Rivia. I promised  that I would be there and that Yennefer would accompany me. I will fulfil my promise, with  or without your consent.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Certainly I  know how I will vote. My vote therefore pushes the scales over and settles the matter.'  'Your insolence,' Sabrina said, lacing her fingers together, loaded with onyx rings,  'borders on bad taste, Yennefer.'  'If I was in your place, madam, I would keep a discreet silence,' Sile added gravely. 'And  be fearful of another vote, to deal with you.'  'I voted for Ciri,' Francesca said, 'but you, Yennefer, I have to call to order. You ran  away from the Lodge, refusing to cooperate. But you have responsibilities and obligations,  debts that you have to repay, the verdict must be made.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"But you have responsibilities and obligations,  debts that you have to repay, the verdict must be made. Otherwise you would not have been  allowed to cross the threshold of Montecalvo.'  Yennefer grabbed Ciri, who was dying to get up and scream. Finally, without resistance,  Ciri dropped back into her chair in silence. Lady Owl, suddenly rose from her seat,  dominating the whole table. 'Yennefer,' she proclaimed loudly, 'you are not entitled to a vote, that is clear.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Destiny is not the way to providence or comfortable fatalism. Destiny is hope. I  am full of hope that it will become what we want to happen, so I give my vote to Ciri - Child  of Destiny, Child of Hope'  In the pillared hall of Montecalvo the was silence for a long time. from outside of the  window came the hunting cry from a sea eagle. 'Lady Yennefer,' Ciri whispered.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"I have come to  the conclusion that it would be stupid to risk it in defence of others..'  'I noticed,' Dandelion nodded. 'On one hand, it is smart. On the other...'  'There is no other.'  'Yennefer and Ciri,' Yarpen asked after a little while, 'have something to do with your  decision?'  'Much.'  'Then everything is clear,' Zoltan sighed. 'I have no clue how a master swordsman will  adapt to normal life. But, try as I might, I cannot see you planting cabbages, although I do  have respect for your choice...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'We're here,' said Yennefer. 'Rivia. What a curious and entangled destiny.'  Ciri was excited and Kelpie kept dancing and shuffling on the edge of the road. Triss  Merigold sighed unnoticed. Rather, she believed it had been unnoticed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'Please,' Yennefer looked at he. 'What strange sounds float from you beauteous breast,  Triss. Ciri, go out and see what lies ahead.'  Triss averted her face, determined not to give Yennefer any excuse. She sis not expect it  to work. For a long time she had been sensing Yennefer's anger and aggression growing  stronger as they approached Rivia.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Or is it that you think because I agreed to your request that I  want to have you with us? That I was interested in seeing you spend a meeting with an old  love? Ciri, I asked you to go on ahead. The two of us need to talk!'  'It is not a discussion, it is a lecture,' Ciri dared to argue, but under the threatening glare  from violet eyes, she immediately recoiled, clucked and galloped off on Kelpie on the road  ahead. 'You're not going to meet a loved one, Triss,' Yennefer continued.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Do  not count too much on fainting. He knows how to forgive.'  'He knows what was done to him, of course,' Yennefer narrowed her eyes. 'But he will  never forgive you for what was done to Ciri. And me.'  'It is possible,' Triss swallowed. 'He may not forgive.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'What the hell is going on?' Yennefer stood in her stirrups. 'A raid? A fire?'  'Geralt...' Ciri suddenly groaned, turning as white as paper. 'Geralt!'   'Ciri? What is the matter?'  Ciri raised her hand and the sorceresses saw blood running down her palm.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"'What is going on?'  'You know!' sobbed Triss, galloping at her side. 'Ride, Yennefer!'  They had ridden between the city's outskirts before they passed their first fugitives fleeing  from the city, Yennefer was bright enough to know what was happening in Rivia, no fire or  raid of troops, but a pogrom. She also knew what Ciri had sensed, what -and whom - she was  rushing too. She knew that she could not catch her. There was nothing she could do.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Frightened people had compacted into a crowd and she and Triss had to slow their  mounts to try and get through. Kelpie just jumped, the hooves of the horse knocking off a few  hats and caps. 'Ciri! Stop!'  Before they knew it, they were among the streets crowded with people running and  screaming. Yennefer, as she rode, saw bodies lying in gutters and noticed bodies hanging by  their legs from posts and beams.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"One was knocked to the ground and the rest  cowered in fright. They rushed into a square, which was covered in acrid smoke. Yennefer realised that Ciri,  undoubtedly guided by a prophetic vision, was heading to the heat of the incident. Where the  fires burned and murder was raging. In the next street there was fighting, dwarves and elves were fiercely defending  themselves from behind a hastily erected barricade, defending a helpless position, falling and  perishing under the pressure of the screaming mob that pounced on them.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"***    Geralt lay senseless, white as chalk. He lay motionless, but when they reached him, he  began to cough, and to spit blood. He began to shake and to tremble so violently that Ciri  could not hold him. Yennefer knelt beside him. Triss saw her hands shaking.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Someone grabbed her, preventing her from falling on  the ground. She recognised Dandelion. 'It won't work,' said Ciri's voice, radiating despair. 'Your magic cannot cure him,  Yennefer.'  'We arrived...' Yennefer could barely move her lips. 'We're too late.'  'Your magic won't work, 'Ciri repeated as if she had not heard.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Dandelion,  still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed. Yennefer moaned, her face changing  suddenly, contracted and ugly. 'There is nothing more pathetic,' said Ciri sternly, 'than a sorceress in tears. You taught  me that. But now you're pathetic Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Never.'  'I love you, Yen.'  'I know.'  'Nevertheless,' he sighed. 'I'd like to know where we are.'  'Me too,' Yennefer said, quietly, after a while. ***    'And that,' Galahad asked, 'is the end of the story?'  'Certainly not,' said Ciri, rubbing one foot against the other, trying to get rid f the sand  sticking to her feet. 'You want it to end? I do not!'  'So what happened next?'   'The normal,' she snorted.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Yennefer
"Then we get on the horses and take full advantage of the invitation of Countess  Anna Henrietta . Do not look at me like that vampire, Milva has broken ribs, Cahir a broken  head, and rest in Toussaint will benefit both of them. And we will also have to remove  Dandelion from the mess he has gotten into, because I fear he has gotten into a good one.'  'Well,' sighed Regis. 'Have it your way. I'll have to avoid mirrors and dogs and will have  to beware of sorcerers and telepaths...",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"They passed roses, mostly multiflora varieties and centifolia. Finally they stood before the carved columns and portals of the palace, were stood soldiers  and footmen in livery. Among those that greeted them was Dandelion, combed and dress like a prince. ***    'Where is Milva?'  'It's okay, don't worry. She is sitting in the chambers, which were prepared for you, and  does not want to move from there.'  'Why?'  'We'll talk about that later.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"And there was our bunch, including Milva in male attire. Oh, we were poorly expressed. It  was not our whole group, we were missing Dandelion. Dandelion or rather Viscount Julian  was lounging in a chair beside Duchess Anarietta and strutted like a peacock. A royal  favourite.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"They never missed a jar or two of red or white from the famous local  vineyards. They went there every morning for the two weeks they spent in Beauclair – Geralt, Regis,  Cahir, Milva and Angouleme. Only Dandelion had breakfast elsewhere. 'He,' Angouleme slathered some bread with butter, 'has his bacon brought to him in bed! With everyone bowing to him!'  Geralt was willing to believe that the girl was right.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"Milva,  Angouleme, don't argue. Hostility ruins, friendship builds. It is said that Her Ladyship the  Duchess and likes Dandelion, her country, the palace, bread, and pickles. Would you like  some wine?'  Milva released a heavy sigh. 'We have been here too long!",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"It's  not your fault.'  Yes it is my fault, he thought. Mine. Dandelion will ask. And I'll have to answer. Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"Then the Geralt spoke. He told the pure truth, and spoke  dry and monotonously. Dandelion could not stand it and interrupted again and again which  earned him reprimands from the dwarves. And then the story was over and there was a long silence. 'For the archer Milva!' Zoltan cleared his throat and raised his cup in a salute.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"'They got married.'  'Tell me.'  'What's to tell? The celebrate with a big wedding. They invited everyone - Dandelion,  Mother Nenneke, Iola and Eurneid, Yarpen Zigrin, Vesemir, Eskel... Coen, Milva,  Angouleme... And Mistle.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Milva
"Like an avalanche rolling down from the mountains into the valley that collects more and  more snow and gains power, so did the consequences of the Battle of Brenna provide more  damage to the Nilfgaardians. The Verden Group Army was heavily afflicted by pirate raids  and attacks from Skellige and King Ethain from Cidaris. When Commander Duke de Wett  learned of the disaster at Brenna and the news reached him that Foltest and John Natalis had  ordered a forced march, he immediately sounded a retreat and in panic fled across the river  to Cintra and escaping significant losses to his troops, because word had gotten around  about Nilfgaard's defeat and a new rebellion was rising in force in Verden. Only troops  remained in the forts of Nastrog, Rozrog and Bodrog and after the Peace of Cintra they  emerged with honour with banners aloft. Meanwhile, in Aedirn, the news of what happen at Brenna caused the antagonised Kings  Demavend and Henselt to join together in arms against Nilfgaard's East Group Army, which  was led by Duke Ardal aep Dahy into the Pontar valley, unable to resist the combined forces  of the two kings.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"They sat at a round table, where the seats were identified by mahogany tablets. Meve, Queen of Rivia and Lyria. Foltest, King of Temeria and his vassal, King Venzlav of Brugge. Demavend, King of Aedirn. Henselt, King of Kaedwen.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"And the Earl Dijkstra. We should seek to get rid of this spy and remove him from the table of discussions, thought the hierarch. King Henselt and King Foltest, and even young King Kistrin, have already allowed themselves a few sour comments to our Nilfgaardian representatives. This Sigismund Dijkstra is a person of dubious origins with an unacceptable past and reputation. We cannot afford to have such a person distorting the atmosphere of the deliberations.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"'I will not hear any more  discussions about it! No more haggling! No more, I say, deiraedh!'  'Henselt,' Foltest said quietly in a conciliatory tone, 'don't hinder. And do not embarrass  us by screaming in front of His Excellency.'  Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the negotiator on behalf of the Empire of Nilfgaard, bowed with a  false smile, that suggested that the antics of the King of Kaedwen did not irritate or ultimately  interest him. 'Are we going to start attacking each other,' continued Foltest, 'like a pack of rabid dogs?",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"It has for centuries...'  'Upper Aedirn,' Dijkstra spoke again, 'has only been part of Kaedwen since last summer. More specifically, from the twenty-four of July last year. From the moment that Kaedwen  sent in occupational forces.'  'I ask,' said Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, 'that it be recorded ad futuram rei memorian, that the  Empire of Nilfgaard had nothing to do with this annexation.'  'Except for at that time you were plundering Vengerberg.'  'Nihil ad rem!'  'Really?'  'Gentlemen!' Foltest admonished. 'The Kaedwen army,' fumed Henselt, 'entered the Lower Marches as liberators! My  soldiers were greeted with flowers!",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"'We will never reach an agreement!'  'Gentlemen,' said Cyrus the hierarch in a conciliatory tone, who until then had been  dozing. 'No doubt, we can always reach some compromise...'  'The Empire of Nilfgaard,' said Shilard, 'does not intend to accept any solution that  would harm the country of the elves of Dol Blathanna. If necessary, My Lords, I will re-read  the content of the memorandum...'  Henselt, Foltest and Dijkstra snorted, but Demavend looked at the Imperial ambassador  calmly, almost benevolently. 'For the good of the people,' he said, 'and to maintain the peace, I acknowledge the  autonomy of Dol Blathanna. But not as a kingdom, but as a duchy.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"The army of  Kaedwen, which breached my boarders as an aggressor and occupier, has one week to leave  the fortresses and castles that they have illegally occupied in Upper Aedirn. That is the  condition for me to continue to take part in these negotiations. And verba volant, my  secretary will add an official protocol in that sense.'  'Henselt?' Foltest gave him a questioning look. 'Never!' bellowed the King of Kaedwen, overturning his chair and jumping like a  chimpanzee stung by a hornet. 'I will never give up the Marches!",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"'I will summarise it, and limit myself to the  most important points. The Imperial Majesty expresses his satisfaction over the course of the  deliberations so far and welcomes the achieved compromises and reconciliations. His  Imperial Majesty wishes to make further progress in the negotiations and to conclude them  with mutual benefit...'  'Let's get to the point,' said Foltest, 'And quickly! Let's conclude the mutual benefits and  return home.'  'That's the spirit,' Henselt said, who was farther from home than anyone. 'Let us get this  over with, or we'll be here until winter.'  'We have one more compromise,' said Meve.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"Face... left!'  They stood at attention in their saddles, turning the horses heads to face the grandstand  and the seats and thrones arranged there. I can see Foltest, Julia thought. The one with the beard must be Henselt of Kaedwen, and  the handsome man is Demavend of Aedirn... That Matron must be Queen Hedwig...",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"Long live Adam Pangratt! Long  live Lorenzo Molla!'  'Long live Constable Natalis!'  'Long live our monarchs! Long live Foltest, Demavend and Henselt!'  'Long live Lord Dijkstra!'  'Long live His Holiness!' A few voices came from the crowd, obviously bribes. Novigrad's hierarch Cyrus Englekind Hemmelfart rose and blessed the people and the army  with his outstretched hands, while irreverently covering Queen Hedwig and young Radovid  with the skirts of his robe. Nobody shouts,  Long live Radovid , thought the prince covered by the hierarch's fat ass.",The Lady of the Lake,Foltest,Henselt
"Physiologus                                                                   Chapter Four      The smell in the great pillared hall of Castle Montecalvo was a mix of old tapestries, smoky  candles, and ten different kinds of perfume - ten specially compiled types of perfume that  were used by the ten women around the oak table, seated in chairs with arms carved in the  shape of sphinxes. Opposite Fringilla Vigo sat Triss Merigold in a bright blue, high-necked dress. Next to Triss  sat Keira Metz, who remained in the shadows. Her large earrings held faceted citrines that  flashed again and again with a thousand twinkles, attracting the eye. Please continue, Miss Vigo,  urged Philippa Eilhart.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"Well, maybe not completely ... She trailed off. She thought she had seen Triss Merigold's blue eyes flash with hatred. But  perhaps it had just been a reflection of the flickering candle flames. Philippa snorted and  played with her cameo.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"Fringilla Vigo let her eyes wander around the sorceresses sitting at the table. Around Sile,  Philippa, and Sabrina Glevissig. Around Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and Triss  Merigold. Around Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, whose intensely painted elven eyes  expressed nothing. Around Assire var Anahid, whose eyes were restlessness and full of  anxiety.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"Fringilla bowed and raised her glass in reply. She noticed a hint of mockery in Philippa's  black eyes. There was indignation in Triss Merigold's blue-eyed gaze. She could not decipher  the smiles of Francesca or Sile. It begins,  said Assire var Anahid, pointing to the magical image.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"I really ... do not... I do,  said Triss Merigold. This castle ... Philippa said thoughtfully, ignoring the others.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"She's  safe. Unless they have lied to me again. 'Take a seat, ladies,' Philippa Eilhart said, who Triss had been watching suspiciously for  some time. 'The sovereigns of the world will in a moment begin to recite their inaugural  speeches. I would not want us to miss a single word.'  The sorceresses, interrupting their gossip and quickly took their seats.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"On the wall behind the Nilfgaardian witch  was a picture of a rider galloping down an alley of alders. The trees limbs reached towards  the rider and their black cavities that served as mouths laughed. Triss shivered involuntary. Set in the middle of the table was a telecommunicator. Philippa, with a spell, adjusted the  image and sound.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"I have been told about something, which I have not had time to tell you  ladies. The case of Cintra, dear colleagues, is already resolved and settled.'  'What?' Philippa's eyes narrowed. 'What's that supposed to mean?'  Triss Merigold sighed audibly. She already knew. She had already guessed what it meant.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"This is the round table  of the Lodge, and all who sit at it are equals – even when one of us is on trial. I think that we  can agree...'  She did not finish, she glanced at all the sorceresses. One by one, they all nodded their  heads in agreement – Margarita, Triss, Assire, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and both elves. Only the second Nilfgaardian, the dark-haired Fringilla Vigo did not give an affirmative nod,  she was pale as death as she stared at Yennefer. 'So be it,' Philippa Eilhart waved her hand.",The Lady of the Lake,Triss,Philippa
"Because it is hard to shake the feeling that they are mocking us. In everything that they do,  what they say, what they think, elves make a mockery of us and scoff.'  'The anthropomorphism is speaking through you.'  'Maybe a little. But the impression remains.'  'What do we do?'   'Return to Caed Myrkvid, to see Cahir, who no doubt has had his scalp wound healed by  the Druids. Then we get on the horses and take full advantage of the invitation of Countess  Anna Henrietta . Do not look at me like that vampire, Milva has broken ribs, Cahir a broken  head, and rest in Toussaint will benefit both of them.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"On my honour, there is  more to discuss.'  'I am of the same opinion.' said Regis. 'Lighten up, Geralt. After all the Druidess healed  Milva...'  'And the Druidess is familiar with treatments,' Cahir interjected. 'The best example is my  own head. Look, it is as good as new.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"He feared to accept it. His good humour  did not reach that far. Cahir and Milva sat on the opposite side of the table. The young man was sitting between  two noble young ladies, probably baronesses that kept talking to him. Meanwhile, the archer  kept company with an older gentleman, dark and silent, his stone face was scarred from  smallpox.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"The knight who sat to his right laughed with a vibrant falsetto. Geralt took a pot of duck in aspic and served it to Fringilla. He saw two young  Baronesses religiously looking at Cahir, and how he honestly tried to divide among them  equally his attention. He saw the young knights bustle around Angouleme, getting her food  and laughing at her silly jokes. He saw Milva crumbling bread and staring at the tablecloth.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"You don't  trust me.'  'Listen, I...'  'Do not explain yourself. Eat some more artichokes.'  Again someone made a vow to the heron. Cahir spoke to the baronesses giving them  compliments. Angouleme, tipsy, could be heard throughout the whole room. The pockmarked  and flushed baron, mesmerized by discussions about archery and hunting, even started flirting  with Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"For some reason, they were always welcome and always  found something for them in the pots, pans or grills, usually bread, bacon, cheese or maybe  pickled mushrooms. They never missed a jar or two of red or white from the famous local  vineyards. They went there every morning for the two weeks they spent in Beauclair – Geralt, Regis,  Cahir, Milva and Angouleme. Only Dandelion had breakfast elsewhere. 'He,' Angouleme slathered some bread with butter, 'has his bacon brought to him in bed!",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"Fuck, what did I tell you! We have to get out of here as quickly as possible!'  'We must talk to Geralt,' muttered Milva. 'We must talk to him.'  'Yes, talk to him,' Cahir said sarcastically, 'in one of those rare moments, where he is  available. Hunting witches and monsters are the only activities that he has performed in the  last two months.'  'And you,' Angouleme snorted,' can only be caught while walking in the park playing  with the baronesses. This is what happens in spellbound, Toussaint.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"The problem,  she continued,  was his companions. The  strange band that he named his company. Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, who had seen  me before and tormented himself to remember where. But he could not remember, because  when I was last in Darn Dyffra, the ancestral home of his family, he was six or seven years  old. Milva, who seemed to be a daredevil and proud girl, but who I twice caught hiding in a  corner of the stables and crying.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"They had gone into the ravine about a  quarter mile. 'They've ended,' Angouleme said, looking down at the pristine snow. 'The horse has  disappeared like in an Elvish circus.'  'What now, Geralt?' Cahir turned in his saddle. 'The tracks have disappeared. The wind  has covered them.'  'No,' disagreed Milva.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"The wind  has covered them.'  'No,' disagreed Milva. 'The storm isn't blowing hard enough in the ravine to hide tracks.'   'So what happened to the horse?'  The archer shrugged and huddled up in her saddle. 'Where is the horse?' Cahir did not give up. 'Did it fly away? Vanish?",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"On his helmet stretched the wings of a bird of prey. His  raised sword glistened. 'Leave him, Cahir,' the white-haired man said sharply. 'Save time and blood. Milva,  Regis, this way...'  'No, not that way,' Boreas said, not knowing why he did so.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"'We have to get the hell out of here!' he shouted. 'Listen up! Cahir, help Angouleme!'  'They are going to mow us down!'   'We have to go! There is no choice!'  'No!' Milva exclaimed, rising with her bow in hand. She stood up and took a firing  position.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"An arrow hit the wall and dusted Milva's hair in lime  powder. The archer blew a strand of hair from her eyes and readied her bow. 'Milva,' Geralt called after Cahir and Angouleme had run to safety. 'Enough! Run!'  'Just one more,' said the archer, with the feather of the arrow at the corner of her mouth.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"It tore into her guts and severed an artery and shattered her pelvis. The archer fell  to the floor as if hit by a battering ram. Geralt and Cahir cried out with one voice. Aware that the Milva was down, the archers in  the gallery once again jumped up and fired a hail of arrows. One of the arrows hit Cahir's  helmet.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"Milva left behind her a large, shiny trail of blood. In the place where she lay, in a blink of  an eye, it had grown into a puddle on the floor. Cahir cursed, his hands were shaking. Geralt  felt overwhelmed by despair. And rage.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
And I'll have to answer. Milva. Cahir. Regis. Angouleme.,The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"He marvelled at how small and light she was. He would have  sworn that someone helped him lift her. He would have sworn that he felt Cahir's arms  helping. That he caught a glimpse of Milva's braid. He would have sworn that when he took  the sorceress to the boat, he saw Angouleme's little had holding it steady.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Milva
"A rider on a galloping horse, a misshapen double row of  alders, stretching out their arms their branches towards him. Condwiramurs felt a chill go  through her. 'Ciri... Hmmm... Apparently her night ride to her meeting with Geralt at the Halfling  Hofmeier's farm.'  The next picture, a dark oil painting.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"A battle scene. 'Geralt and Cahir defending the bridge on the Yaruga.'  Then faster and faster. 'Yennefer and Ciri, their first meeting in the temple of Melitele. Dandelion and the dryad  Eithne, in the woods of Brokilon. The company of Geralt during a blizzard on the mountain  pass of Malheur...'  'Well done,' Nimue praised.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"She had not expected such a question; she  smelled a test, an exam, a trap. She stopped to avoid being caught. How ends the legend of Ciri and Geralt? After all, everyone knows that. She stared into the dark tones of the watercolour depicting the clumsy barge moving  along the surface over a misty lake, a figure standing on the barge was only visible as a black  silhouette.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"to keep  pace with the daughters of earls and bankers for which everything was easy, they laughed at a  village girl...'  She paused, then snapped her fingers. 'Finally,' she went on. 'I found time for reading, but then I realised that the adventures of  Geralt and Ciri held far less interest to me that they did in my childhood. It appears to be a  similar syndrome with me as with you. What did you call it?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'I'm sorry to spoil your good humour, my dear,' said the wizard coldly. 'Because I have  the sad news that the Geralt, Geralt of Rivia is also dead. Yes, Yes, the same Geralt Geralt,  with whom, as with Ciri, you associated your surrogate feelings, foolish, embarrassing and  nauseating to the stomach. Know Yennefer that our dear friend, the Geralt, said goodbye to  the world in a truly fiery spectacular. On this occasion, you should not have any remorse.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I think I know. What you  told me is a lie. You have lost Ciri and Geralt escaped, while organising a bloodbath for your  minions. Now what? Your plans have collapsed, turned to dust and you yourself have  recognised that your dreams of power have faded like smoke.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'I promise you our help and support,' she said. 'Stay in Toussaint as long as you wish. You should know that I used to visit Cintra, I knew and cultivated a friendship with Pavetta  and knew and loved little Ciri. I am with you wholeheartedly, Mister Geralt. If necessary, you  will have the assistance of our scholars and sorcerers.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"You can stay here as a welcome guest  as long as necessary.'  'I thank you for your kindness and grace,' Geralt bowed. 'However, we must continue on  the road. Ciri is still in danger. And we are also in danger. When we stop for too long in one  place, the danger not only grows, but begins to threaten the people around us.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"But they sent me to the  border, to a watchtower, in the cold and grey mountains. What despair, the fate of a knight..!'  'The large and highly anticipated banquet,' Geralt said, 'was prepared with great care and  diligence. We mainly had to find Milva, who had holed up in the stables and convince her  that her attendance at the banquet was essential and depended upon the fate of Ciri and nearly   the whole world. We almost forcibly compelled her to wear women's clothes. Then we had to  get Angouleme to promise to behave as a well-behaved young lady, and to especially avoid  words like  fuck  and  ass .",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"December came,  she continued. Then Yule, then the New  Year. The Geralt calmed down to the point where Ciri's name no longer showed up in every  conversation. The monster hunting expeditions, which he regularly undertook, seemed to  completely avail him. Well, maybe not completely ...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Angoul'me wiped a smudge of red beet from her nose with her  sleeve. The vampire played thoughtfully with a sausage link. Thanks to me,  Fringilla finally broke the silence,  Geralt has learned what few people know  - Ciri's family tree and the secrets of its origin. Thanks to me, he knows these things that he  had no idea about a year ago. Thanks to me he has information, and information is a weapon.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Cahir also said nothing. Angouleme looked around; she had obviously not  understood much. If it is written in the books of providence , the sorceress said after a while,  that Geralt will  find Ciri, then it will happen. Regardless of whether the Geralt sets off into the mountains or  sits in Toussaint. Predestination overtakes humans.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Oh no, Geralt. Ride alone,  die alone, freeze to death in the passes alone. I have no obligation to Ciri. And to you? Do  you know how many people beg for this, what you have?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Now ride off, before I start to cry. And when it's over, you have to stop by Toussaint, come back to tell me everything. And I  will paint Ciri. Do you promise, Geralt? I promise.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The wind blows and whistles. Before her, in a blizzard, on a horse is Geralt. Ciri knows it, But his head is covered in a  fur cap and a woollen scarf covers his face. Behind him in the blizzard, loom other riders,  their lines are blurred, so thickly bundled that it is impossible to discern what they are. Geralt looks straight at her.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The snow will not stop falling on Geralt, it  surrounds him covering his legs and shoulders with a soft blanket. The blizzard howls and whistles... Ciri jumped up and slammed the mirror hard against the wall. The amber frame burst and  the glass shattered. She recognised these kind of vision, she remembered them and knew what they were.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"In the first dream he saw the Geralt Geralt or Rivia who occasionally visited mother  Nenneke. The Geralt sat motionless under icicles hanging from an overhanging rock and  was snowed in from a blizzard. In the second dream, Ciri was hunched over a horse's neck,  galloping towards a low wall of alders. Oh yes, and just before dawn he dreamed of Triss Merigold. After he last stay in the  temple the young man dreamed of the enchantress often.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I know this story! When I was a child I heard this tale, from the old wandering storyteller... The Geraltess  Ciri... The scar on her cheek... The black mare, Kelpie...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"In a valley a rushing river was rushing and thick with ice. Everywhere was  white. I have these abilities, Ciri thought, such power. I'm the Lady of the Worlds but there is  no point! I wanted Geralt and I find myself lost in the wilderness, in winter in a blizzard.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"And I feel robbed. Robbed  of the possibility of committing follies. I cannot go madly hurrying after Ciri to help her, I  cannot run like crazy to save Geralt and Yennefer. Not only that, there is a war, which you  have sent your girls... A war, that Jarre fled to and I am refused the possibility to even stand  on a hill.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'Such an insect, and yet he had great blood in him. This is what we call a - hidden quality. Let's go, Ciri, I'll escort you to Geralt.'  'No,' Ciri said. 'Do not be afraid of me.'  'I'm not afraid,' she protested, bravely clenching her jaw so that he could not hear her  teeth chattering in terror. 'No, because...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'I'm really impressed, Geralt. You are hopelessly naive  and stupid, but your technique is really impressive.'  'Your underlings,' Yennefer said calmly, 'just took off and left you. Give us Ciri and we'll  leave you alone.'  'You know, Yennefer,' sneered the wizard, 'that is the second generous offer I've had  today? Thank you, thank you. And here is my answer...'  'Look out!' Yennefer screamed and jumped.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It will take them some time before they can get  through that door!'  'They will not waste the time, they'll seek another way,' said the black knight matter-of- factly, the frowned suddenly, seeing the blood seeping from the girl's leg. The blond waved  her hand, it was nothing. 'We have to get out of here,' the knight took off his helmet and looked at Ciri. 'I am  Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, the son of Ceallach. I came here with Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I came here with Geralt. To rescue you, Ciri. I  know that it is unbelievable.'  'I've seen unbelievable things,' Ciri said. 'You have come a long way... Cahir...",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Go. Help Geralt...'  Cahir shook his head. 'Ciri,' he said mildly. 'I'm surprised at you. I cross the whole world to see you, and now  that I found you, to redeem myself, to save you and defend you.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Your friends, Geraltess? All right. Two more or less,  it does not make a difference.'  Ciri suddenly thought of something. 'Say goodbye to your life, Bonhart,' she cried. 'This is your end.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I want this  wench, I have nothing against you.'  'Strong words,' Cahir said calmly. 'Let's see what else you can do. Angouleme, Ciri,  run!'  'Cahir...'  'Go,' he said, 'help Geralt.'  They ran off. Ciri helped the limping girl. 'You asked for it,' Bonhart narrowed his pale eyes, as he did he twirled his sword.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Do you see?'  'Yes, Geralt.'  Suddenly, swift as an attacking snake, she counterattacked. Swallow hissed through the  air and collided with Bonhart's sword. At the same time Ciri bounced and jumped to an  adjacent beam. She landed, miraculously keeping her balance. She ran a few steps and lightly  jumped again, back to the Bonhart's beam, landing behind him.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'But it's not the first I've seen.' Can you walk?'  'With your help, yes.'    ***    They met in a place where the corridors came together to form and arch. They met under  the dead eyes of the statues. 'Ciri,' the Geralt said, rubbing his eyes. 'Ciri,' Yennefer said, supported by the Geralt. 'Geralt,' Ciri said.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"She hugged  her tightly. Very tightly. Geralt saw the sorceress's hands on Ciri's back. He saw the  deformed fingers. He did not feel anger, grief or hatred.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"And a great  desire to be done with it all. 'Mummy.'  'My daughter.'  'Let's go,' Geralt decided to interrupt, but only after a long time. Ciri sniffed noisily and wiped her nose with the back of her hand. Yennefer scolded her  with a look and rubbed one of her eyes. Surely she had gotten a speck of powder in them.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Surely she had gotten a speck of powder in them. The  Geralt watched the corridor from which Ciri emerged, as if expecting someone else to come  from there. Ciri shook her head. He understood. 'Let's go,' he repeated.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'Let's go,' he repeated. 'Yes,' said Yennefer. 'I want to see the sky.'  'I'll never leave you again,' Ciri said dully. 'Never again.'  'Let's go,' said Geralt. 'Ciri help Yen.'  'I don't need help!'  'Let me help you, mother.'  Before them was a staircase.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"We have no choice, girl. Yen wants to see  the sky. And I want to see the sky, Yen and you.'  Ciri looked at Yennefer, who if not for the railing she was leaning against, would have  fallen down. She pulled out the medallions she took from Bonhart. The cat she hung around  her neck, the wolf she gave to Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The Owl with a quick gesture sent the first wave of attackers. The stair  thundered with the sound of heavy boots. 'Slowly, Ciri, don't rush. Stay close to me.'  'I know, Geralt.'  'And calmly, girl, quietly. Remember, no anger, no hated.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'Kill them!'  Three more attacked. Geralt stepped forward, feinted at one, and cut another's throat. He  spun and Ciri dashed under his right arm. The girl slashed a second mercenary under his arm. The third tried to escape by jumping over the railing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"He did not make it. Geralt wiped a few drops of blood from his face. 'Calmly, Ciri.'  'I am calm.'  Three more approached. A flash of swords, screaming, death. Thick blood trickled down the smooth stone stairs.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"A mercenary with a jacket with brass rivets rushed them with a spear. His eyes shone  with narcotics use. Ciri, with a quick step, deflected the spear and Geralt slashed at the man. He wiped his face. They continued to walk, without looking back.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Shoot up closer!'  The crossbowman pretended not to hear. Skellen swore, grabbed the crossbow, jumped  up the stairs, knelt and aimed. Geralt immediately covered Ciri with his body, but the girl  slipped past him and as the rope from the crossbow twanged, she was already in position. She  twisted her sword into the upper quarter and the bolt hit it so hard it hung in the air a long  time before falling to the ground. 'Very good,' Geralt muttered.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"After a thundering  call to drop all weapons, everyone listened, because they could see the black soldiers were  burning for an excuse to do something. The Owl stood on a step and crossed his arms. 'The miraculous rescue,' Ciri said in a whisper. Geralt shook his head. The crossbows and spears were turned in their direction as well.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"But they did not throw down their  swords. They carefully placed them on the steps. Geralt felt the warmth from Ciri's arm and  could hear her breathing. Above, avoiding the corpses and spilled blood, came Yennefer. She showed the soldiers  her empty hands and sat down heavily on the step next to Geralt and Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Now it's our turn, thought Geralt. He was right. The officer stared at Ciri. His eyes shone  through the opening in his visor, watching everything without missing a detail. Her paleness.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"At least you spared the hangman some work. You have  travelled a long way, Geralt.'  Geralt did not respond. Ciri sniffed again and wiped her nose on the back of her hand. Yennefer again scolded her with her eyes. The Nilfgaardian noticed it and smiled.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"During that time, please provide all available services and convenience to both ladies. Obviously under the constant watch of guards.'  'As you wish, Your Majesty!'  'Geralt, follow me, please.'  The Geralt rose. He looked at Ciri and Yennefer, wanting to calm them, wanting to  warning them not to try any nonsense. But it was not needed – they were both extremely  tired. And resigned.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Often they are disappointed by the first few days... and nights of marriage. Ciri is not the  first.'  Geralt declined to comment. 'Ciri,' continued the Emperor, 'will be happy, like most of the queens I just spoke  about. It will come with time.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"A son who will be ruler of the world and who will save the world from destruction. So  says the prophecy, whose precise content, only I know...'  The White Flame thought for a moment and continued. 'It is clear that Ciri must never know who I really am. The secret must die. Along with  those who know it.'  'Sure' Geralt nodded.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Duny, Pavetta and their child were to die, disappear without a trace...'  'The faked sinking ship.'  'Right. While sailing from Skellige to Cintra we had been driven by magic to the Sedna  Abyss, where Vilgefortz pulled our boat into the maelstrom. I, Pavetta and Ciri would be  close in a specially protected cabin and survive. The crew...'  'They would not survive,' finished the Geralt. 'Then began your journey over the  corpses.'  'It started a little earlier,' he said after a moment in a dully voice.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The nation needed living space and the vox populi would be  considered this my test as Emperor. I decided to kill two birds with one stone. I would take in  one fell swoop, Cintra and Ciri. The rest you know.'  'Yes, I know,' said Geralt. 'Thanks for the chat, Duny.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"If I escape from prison I'll come for Ciri. It is the  price I must pay and you know it.'  'I know it.'  'You can spare Yennefer's life. She does not know the secret.'  'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri. And to avenge your  death.'  'True,' said the Geralt. 'I almost forgot how much she loves the girl.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"This  is not fair!'  'He who lives by the sword,' Emhyr var Emreis said dully,' dies by the sword. They both  fought with me and lost. But they lose with dignity.'  Ciri, in three steps stood before him, Geralt silently gasped. He heard Yennefer sigh. Bloody hell, he thought, anyone can see it!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Even if tied up. When you sleep,  I'll bite through your throat...'  The Emperor with a quick gesture silenced the murmuring of his officers. 'This will happen,' he drawled, not taking his eyes from Ciri, 'as intended. Say goodbye  to your friends, Ciri Fiona Elen Riannon.'  Ciri looked at the Geralt, Geralt made a dismissive motion with his head. The girl  sighed.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The girl  sighed. She hugged Yennefer and whispered together for a long time. Ciri then approached  Geralt. 'A pity,' she said quietly. 'It seemed that everything was beginning to improve.'  'It seemed to be so,' said the Geralt.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I will escape  him. I know a way...'  'Do not kill him. Remember, Ciri. You cannot!'  'Fear not, I didn't even think about it. You know, Geralt, I've had enough of killing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"They took all the  prisoners, mounted their horses and left. They left no one behind.'  'They left no one?'  'Nobody.'  'Incomprehensible,' Geralt shook his head. 'I don't understand it.'  'And nothing happened,' Yennefer cleared her throat, 'to explain this?'  'No,' Ciri replied quickly, 'nothing.'  She lied. ***    At first, she had tried to appear fine. Erect, proud, head held high and her face impassive,  while being pushed into the gloved hands of the Black knights, while throwing bold and  challenging looks and those helmets which made her so afraid.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Something like this must not be repeated, dear ladies.'  The Lodge – except for Fringilla who was pale as a corpse – shook their heads. 'At the moment,' Philippa said, 'Geralt Geralt is somewhere in Ebbing. Along with  Yennefer and Ciri. We will need to consider how to find them...'  'And the castle?' Sabrina Glevissig interrupted. 'Have you forgotten to do something  about that, Philippa?'  'No, I have not forgotten.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Here in this room, after the devastation of the throne  room, a memorable conversation took place between Calanthe, the Geralt, Pavetta and an  enchanted hedgehog. Here the Queen agreed to a strange marriage. After all, the princess  was already pregnant and Ciri was born less than eight months later... Ciri, the heiress to the  throne, the young lion with the Lioness's blood... Ciri, my little sister.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Nothing,  not even tax fraud, could compensate for his losses. ***    'Now where?' Geralt asked, looking at the column of smoke that clouded the rosy  morning sky. 'Where else do you want to visit, Ciri?'  She looked at him and he soon regretted asking. Suddenly he wanted to hug her, he  dreamed of holding her in his arms, cuddling her and caressing her hair. To protect her.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I want those remains to rest in a decent tomb.'  Geralt said nothing. But didn't look away. 'After,' continued Ciri, without the slightest difficulty withstanding his look, 'the village  of Dun Dare. The local tavern has probably been burned and it is possible that the innkeeper  has been murdered. It is my fault; I was blinded by hatred and revenge.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I will remember the look in their eyes. I hope that the memory of those eyes will protect me  from similar mistakes. Do you understand, Geralt?'  'I understand, Ciri,' Yennefer said. 'Both of us, we understand you very well, my dear. Let's go.'    ***    The horses ran as if carried by the wind of a magic storm.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"People listened as if in a trance, captivated by the emphatic words of  the storyteller who told the story of the Geralt and the sorceress. The story of the Tower of  the Swallow. Of Ciri, the Geraltess with the scarred face. Of Kelpie, the magical black mare. Of the Lady of the Lake.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"***    They did not realise when May came. They first noticed at night time, when they saw the  bright, distance fires of Belleteyn. When Ciri, with strange excitement jumped onto Kelpie's  back and galloped towards the fires, Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the intimate  moment. After removing the necessary clothes, they made love on a sheepskin on the ground. They  made love urgently, in silence, without words.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It is  necessary to comply. I'm doing this for your own good. And especially for the good of Ciri.'  He nodded. 'Until we meet again,' she said almost tenderly, 'I'll make it up to you, Geralt. There has  been too much silence between us.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Now instead of nodding, give me a hug and kiss.'  He obeyed. One way or another, he loved her. ***    'Now where?' Ciri asked, she had barely spoken since Yennefer had disappeared with a  flash through her portal. 'The river...' Geralt coughed, conquering the pain under his breast bone. 'The river in  front of us is called the Sansretour.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"We left him here, alongside his beloved. We promised him to visit on  our return visit, when...'  He paused and became serious. 'There was nothing you could do,' Ciri said quietly. 'Do not torture yourself, Geralt. It's  not your fault.'  Yes it is my fault, he thought.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"And basilisk  shoes. I know a shoemaker, who should have some in stock.'  'How did you make so much money?'  'By killing. Let's go, Ciri, let's not waste time.'    ***    In the bank of Cianfanelli, Geralt requested a transfer, credit allocation and took some  money. He wrote letters that were given to fast couriers that were riding for the Yaruga. He  politely excused himself from the dinner invitation from the attentive and polite banker.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Ciri waited in the street watching the horses. The street, which was empty a moment ago,  was now swarming with people. 'I think today is a holiday,' Ciri nodded with her head towards the square where the  crowd was heading. 'Or a fair...'  Geralt took a quick look. 'That's not a fair.'  'Ah...' Ciri stood up in her stirrups and looked around.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'So it's...'  'A execution,' he confirmed. 'The most popular post-war entertainment. What are the  reasons, Ciri?'  'For desertion, treason, cowardice before the enemy,' she recited fluently. 'And for  economic crimes.'  'Supplying the army with mouldy biscuits,' said the Geralt. 'During the war, an  enterprising merchant can easily get into trouble.'  'This does not look like the execution of a huckster,' Ciri pulled on Kelpie's reins,  submerging herself in the middle of the crowd, 'Look, the scaffolding is covered with cloth  and the executioner has a new, clean hood.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"He is executing someone important, perhaps a  noble. So it could be cowardice in the face of the enemy...'  'Toussaint,' Geralt shook his head, 'did not have an army that faced the enemy. No, Ciri,  I guess this has to do with the economy. The condemned is probably guilty of some scam in a  wine shop and damaged the foundation for the local economy. Let's go, Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"So they were caught completely by   surprise by the appearance of a cart from an ally, drawn by two horses. On the cart, trying to  maintain his balance with difficult was... 'Dandelion...' Ciri groaned. Geralt suddenly felt ill. Very ill.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"At the foot of the scaffold four ragged urchins held out a scarf to collect the blood in. There was a great demand for this type of souvenirs, and good money could be earned. 'Geralt,' Ciri said in a low voice. 'We have to so do something...'   He did not answer. 'I wish to speak to the people,' Dandelion said proudly.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'My lands, forests and castles  you can have, but let me take my lute, my horse, Pegasus, my one hundred and forty  ducatsand eighty dimes, my cloak lined with duck, my ring...'  'Shut up!' shouted Geralt, pushing through the crowd on his horse. 'Shut up and get down  here you mutton head! Ciri, clear us a way! Dandelion! Did you hear what I said?'  'Geralt?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Come here! Jump up!'  They walked through the crowd and went into a gallop down a close alley. Ciri went first,  followed by Geralt and Dandelion riding Roach. 'What's the rush?' the bard asked from behind the Geralt. 'No one is persecuting us.'  'For now.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It is true that she was unnerved when she caught me with the young  Baroness Nique... But surely she has calmed down, she will realise that I was not made for  monogamy. She'll forgive me and be waiting...'  'You are hopelessly stupid,' Geralt said and Ciri nodded vigorously to indicate she felt  the same way. 'I will not argue with you,' Dandelion said, offended. 'It's an intimate matter.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"You would not have seen her. She left shortly after your departure, In  January. She simply disappeared.'  'I did not mean her,' Geralt coughed, looking over at Ciri who was listening. 'I wanted to  see Reynart. To introduce him to Ciri...'  Dandelion bowed his head.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"***    On the twenty-sixth of May they crossed the Yaruga on a new, white resin scented bridge. Remnants of the old bridge, black, burnt, charred piles were still visible in the water and on  the shore. Ciri began to get restless. Geralt knew why. He knew her intentions, her plans and arrangement with Yennefer.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It served the people as communication. The tree was  known as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 'Ciri, you start from that side,' Geralt ordered dismounting form his saddle. 'Dandelion  you look from the other side.'  The branches draped with tablets, swayed in the light wind and clattered and bumped into  each other. As was usual after a war, a lot of the messages were for missing family members.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"They offer great  rewards. Comfortable accommodation and delicious meals are provided. Any interest,  Geralt?'  'Not at all.'  Ciri found the message she had been looking for. She announced to the Geralt what he had long been expecting. ***     'I'm going to Vengerberg, Geralt,' she repeated.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"We  do not have to say goodbye like it is forever. It will only be six days. Goodbye.'  'Goodbye, Ciri.'  'In Rivia, in six days,' she insisted once again, turning Kelpie about. She kicked her into a gallop and was quickly out of sight. Geralt felt as if icy claws were  clawing at his stomach.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Of  course, with that magical mare, she can travel three times faster than us. But even a magical  mare must need to rest. And Ciri's mysterious issue must be resolved. Come on, its  impossible...'  'For Ciri,' the Geralt cut him off, 'nothing is impossible.'  'But...'  'She is no longer the girl you knew,' Geralt did not let him finish. Dandelion was silent for a long time.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Two other women were there, standing calmly. One black and white and the other black  and grey. Yennefer and Ciri. The Geralt moaned in his sleep. ***    Yennefer was right when she did not allow her to wear male clothing.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"And  when I'm done I will come back here, to Montecalvo, and come before this Lodge and  discuss what has been decided.'   Sile moved her lips, as if she had noticed a bad taste in her mouth and wanted to sit it out  immediately. But she remained silent. 'I have to meet,' continued Ciri, 'with the Geralt Geralt in the city of Rivia. I promised  that I would be there and that Yennefer would accompany me. I will fulfil my promise, with  or without your consent.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It is for your own good, to learn discipline.'  'Therefore, let us resolve this issue,' said Philippa Eilhart, placing her hands on the table. 'Let each of us express our opinion. Should we allow this arrogant maid, Ciri, to travel to  Rivia? To meet with the Geralt, for whom there is no place in her life? Are we to allow this  sentimentality, which we will soon have to rid her of?",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I  guess that it is obvious. We all remember the castle Rhys-Rhune.'  'I am grateful for the reminder,' Fringilla cocked her head proudly. 'I am for Ciri. To  prove the admiration and affection I have for the girl. I also do it for the Geralt, Geralt of  Rivia, without which the girl would not be sitting here today.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"I  am full of hope that it will become what we want to happen, so I give my vote to Ciri - Child  of Destiny, Child of Hope'  In the pillared hall of Montecalvo the was silence for a long time. from outside of the  window came the hunting cry from a sea eagle. 'Lady Yennefer,' Ciri whispered. 'It means...'  'Come, my daughter,' Yennefer whispered back. 'Geralt is waiting for is and it is a long  road ahead.'    ***    Geralt awoke suddenly and sat up.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Good to see you, Zoltan Chivay.'    ***     They were the only guests in the pub that smelled of garlic, spices and something  indescribable, but pleasant. They sat at a heavy table overlooking the lake, which through the  glass window next to the table, appeared mysterious, magical and romantic. 'Where is Ciri?' Yarpen Zigrin asked bluntly. 'I hope nothing...'  'No,' Geralt quickly interrupted him, 'she is on her way. You will see her soon.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"It is still bad times.'  'The second example of a girl's omnipotence,' continued Yarpen, 'is Geralt of Rivia, the  Geralt.'  Geralt pretended to be busy with a snail. Yarpen snorted. 'After miraculously finding his Ciri, he allows her to leave. He leaves her alone again,  even though, as someone rightly pointed out here, it is still bad times. All of this happens to  the Geralt, because a woman wanted it.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"'What the hell is going on?' Yennefer stood in her stirrups. 'A raid? A fire?'  'Geralt...' Ciri suddenly groaned, turning as white as paper. 'Geralt!'   'Ciri? What is the matter?'  Ciri raised her hand and the sorceresses saw blood running down her palm.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
'Hide under the skirts of the Lodge! I have to nothing left  to defend! I will not leave Ciri alone! Or Geralt! Begone!,The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"In the Elms district, next to Loc Eskalott, over which burned a rainbow in the sky, and the  weeping willows reflected in the clear mirror of the water, the birds sang again and the grass  smelled wet. Everything looked idyllic. Even the Geralt who lay in a pool of blood in which Ciri knelt. ***    Geralt lay senseless, white as chalk. He lay motionless, but when they reached him, he  began to cough, and to spit blood.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Ciri touched the horn. Triss gasped loudly when she saw the girl's eyes filled with white heat and her head  enveloped in a halo. Ciri did not hear her, did not hear anyone. With one hand she touched  the unicorn's horn, with the other she touched the Geralt. From her fingers drifted a ribbon  of flickering light.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"She looked eagerly, as if she would memorise his image,  as if to save it for the future, for all eternity. He also looked at her as nostalgia gripped his  throat. 'We were in a boat with Ciri,' Geralt recalled. 'On a lake. the on a river with a strong  current.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"The devil, she thought, why not? I bet any money that this world has jobs for a Geraltess. 'Lady Ciri?'  'Let's not talk about it now. Let's ride.'  They rode off towards the sunset. Behind them they left a darkening valley.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Geralt
"Toothbrushes, for example. My private rooms, my library, my  bathroom. And the Fisher King. Please do not try and use the Fisher King.'   Condwiramurs nearly choked on her milk. Nimue's face expressed nothing whatsoever.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"The Fisher King, alarmed by the splashing and yelling, looked back from his boat, he  shaded his eyes with his hand, then immediately turned around and devoted himself to his  fishing tackle. Condwiramurs considered this behaviour offensive and reprehensible. Her  opinion of the Fisher King had greatly increased when she noticed the time that he did not  spend fishing he spent reading. He walked with a book, even to the bathroom, and it was  nothing less than Speculum Aureum, a work both profound and intellectually challenging. So  if it was true that in her early days on Inis Vitre, Condwiramurs was somewhat astonished by  the inclinations of Nimue, they had now stopped.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"I know all of Reverend Jarre's, various scientific treatises on the popular editions that I  will not even mention. All of these readings have left a trace, had an effect, I am not able to  eliminate this from my dreams. Is there a chance to break through the fiction to dream the  truth?'  'There is.'  'How high?'  'The same as,' Nimue nodded towards the boat on the lake, 'which the Fisher King has. You see how he tirelessly checks his hooks. They anchor weeds, roots, submerged stumps,  trunks, old shoes and the drowned devil knows what else.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"When it seemed the something  was about to catch her, the Fisher King pulled powerfully on the oars, the rope tighten and  she was pulled away from the jaws of the unseen predator. She felt like she couldn't breathe,  then she awoke. In her undoubtedly erotic dreams she was kneeling on the rickety boat, clinging to the rail  and the Fisher King held her around the neck from behind as he fucked her enthusiastically,  grunting, spitting and growling the whole time. Apart from the physical pleasure,  Condwiramurs felt an apprehension that chilled her bowels: what if Nimue caught them? Suddenly in the water of the lake she saw the wobbling, threatening face of the little  sorceress...",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"A glow. And then darkness. ***    The curses of the Fisher King, while he pulled and twisted on a rope on his boat trying to  free it from the tangled web at the bottom of the lake, broke the silence of the afternoon. The  oars, which were loose, rattled softly. Nimue coughed impatiently and Condwiramurs turned,  leaving the window and leaned back over the prints.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"Here is Ciri with a unicorn on  a cliff above the sea, here on a narcotic induced landscape, and here under two moons.'  Nimue was silent. 'In short,' Condwiramurs threw the prints onto the table, 'Ciri and the unicorn from all  sides. Ciri and the unicorn in the labyrinth of worlds, Ciri and the unicorn in the abyss of  time...'  'Ciri and the unicorn,' interrupted Nimue, looking out the window at the lake, to the boat  with the Fisher King. Ciri and the unicorn appearing out of nothingness like ghosts and  hanging over a lake, a lake that unites time and places like a bridge, all the time different and  yet always the same?'  'How?'  'Phantoms,' Nimue said not looking at her. 'Visitors from other dimensions, other levels,  other places, other times.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"And you all of a sudden begin to divine. You were talking, like you saw it... in  a dream.'  The Fisher King, judging from the intensity of his voice and curses, failed to untangle the  rope, and it broke. Nimue was silent, looking at the pictures. Ciri and the Unicorn.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"I can feel it.'  Condwiramurs said nothing, although she had heard similar assurances several times. It  was not the first night that they had sat on the balcony in front of them the shining lake and  the setting sun, behind them the magic mirror and the magical tapestry. From the lake echo the curses from the fisher King, who did not hesitate in voicing his  distaste for fishing failures. According to his repertoire, it was possible to conclude that today  he had been extremely successful. 'Time,' said Nimue, 'has no beginning and no end.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"'How long?' said Condwiramurs. 'How long do we have left, do you think? '  'A lot.'  'How much, Nimue?'  'About three thousand years.'  Somewhere on the lake, the Fisher King struck himself with the oar and cursed loudly. Nimue shook her head. Condwiramurs sighed.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"Two women? ***    Condwiramurs could not stand it, she shouted with excitement and then immediately  covered her mouth with her hand. The Fisher King dropped his nets with a splash and the  swore terribly then with his mouth open he froze. Nimue did not move. On the surface of the lake, on a ray of moonlight Appeared a black horse with a rider on  her back.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"Then everything disappeared. The lake was calm, the bar of moonlight settled. It was so  quiet, they thought they could hear the loud breathing of the Fisher King. Nimue refrained from tears and tightly embraced Condwiramurs. She like a little  trembling fairy.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"And what is the use...'  'Silence! Adept Nimue!'  'Present, Mistress.'  'Can you answer the questions? If not, sit straight and do not waste my time.'  'I can.'  'Well, I'm listening.'  'So it stands in the annals that the convent of masters took place at the Castle of Bald  Mountain and there they agree to end the destructive war between the Emperor and the Kings  of the North. Reverend Mother Assire, the holy martyr, decided that the rulers would not stop  fighting until completely exhausted. Whereupon, Reverend Mother Philippa, the holy martyr  decided,  Let's give them an unimaginably horrible, cruel and bloody battle, a battle that will  be unprecedented.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"That Yennefer was also there with her.'  Nimue looked at the watercolour depicting a black mountain, steep and sharp as a knife,  against dark blue clouds. At the top of the hill could be seen a slender silhouette of a woman  with outstretched arms and red hair. Through the fog that covered the surface of the water came the rhythmic clatter of the  Fisher King's oars. 'If anyone was there with Triss,' said the Lady of the Lake, 'they did not survive the vision  of the artist.'    ***    'It seems that you did it,' said Yennefer. 'Watch out, Triss!'  From the black clouds over the city of Rivia fell a barrage of icy hailstones the size of  hens eggs.",The Lady of the Lake,King,Nimue
"What are you doing here?'  Jarre turned impulsively. I'd hoped, he thought, that I would leave my past behind, that  everything would be all new and I seem to constantly bump into old acquaintances. 'Dennis Cranmer!'  A dwarf dressed in a heavy fur coat, steel armour, arm guards and a fox-skin hat with a  tail cast a penetrating look at the boy, then the merchant, then again at the boy. 'What are you doing here Jarre?' he asked sternly, his brows, beard and moustache  bristling. For a moment the boy thought to lie and get the good-hearted merchant to confirm it.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"'I'm going to enlist in the army.'  He knew what the next question would be. 'Do you have permission from Nenneke?'  He did not respond. 'You ran away,' Dennis Cranmer stroked his beard. 'You fled from the temple. And  Nenneke and the priestesses are probably pulling out their hair...'  'I left a letter,' grumbled Jarre.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"Jarre was afraid that one of the opponents would soon roll over the table and  throw the wooden platter with pork, cooked peas and earthenware pints to the floor. He  swallowed a chunk of meat without swallowing, because the last few days had taught him  that anything could befall you. 'I don't understand, Dennis,' said another dwarf at the table called Sheldon Skaggs,  without paying attention to the fact that one of the fighters after a hard blow almost rolled  over his back. 'If the boy is a priest, how is he going to enlist? The blood of priests should not  be spilled.'  'He was schooled at the temple, he's not a priest.'  'Damn, I can never understand those human superstitions.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"Our concern is Menno Coehoorn the Field Marshal  of the Center Army Group.'  'Well,' sighed Zoltan Chivay. 'It seems to me that we are not going to escape a battle. Perhaps the biggest in known history.'  'Much will be decided,' muttered Dennis Cranmer. 'A lot will end.'  'Everything...' Jarre belched and covered his mouth with his hands, embarrassed. 'Everything ends.'  The dwarves watched him for a moment, silent.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"She  is admittedly, substantial. Indeed, even great. But despite her actions, not one whore can put  an end to all whores.'    ***     When they left the inn, Dennis Cranmer took the young man aside. 'I have to praise you, Jarre,' he said. 'Do you know why?'  'No.'  'Do not pretend.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"No one will leave you alone in  your unit, lad.'  'What about you...' Jarre asked. 'Does your unit...'  'Do not even think about it.'  'Because there is only room for dwarves, it that it?' said the boy bitterly. 'Not for me?'  'Right.'  Not for you, thought Dennis Cranmer. Not for you, Jarre. I'm too obliged to Mother  Nenneke.",The Lady of the Lake,Dennis,Jarre
"In everything that they do,  what they say, what they think, elves make a mockery of us and scoff.'  'The anthropomorphism is speaking through you.'  'Maybe a little. But the impression remains.'  'What do we do?'   'Return to Caed Myrkvid, to see Cahir, who no doubt has had his scalp wound healed by  the Druids. Then we get on the horses and take full advantage of the invitation of Countess  Anna Henrietta . Do not look at me like that vampire, Milva has broken ribs, Cahir a broken  head, and rest in Toussaint will benefit both of them. And we will also have to remove  Dandelion from the mess he has gotten into, because I fear he has gotten into a good one.'  'Well,' sighed Regis.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"I am Reynart de Bois-Fresnes.'  'A pleasure to meet you.'  'You were talking of balls?' Angouleme said, urging her horse up next to them. 'I hope  that there will be enough food and drink for us. And I would gladly dance!'  'On my honour, at the court of Duchess Anna Henrietta, there will be plenty of both,' said  Reynart de Bois-Fresnes. 'Singing and feasting and performances by jugglers, theatre,  music, dancing and poetry in the evenings. You're friends of Dandelion...",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"When I finally briefly recounted my  conversation with the flaminica, she anxiously wrung her hands. The gesture was as sincere  as it was exaggerated. It probably sounds like an absurd contradiction in terms, but trust me,  Reynart, it was precisely so.'    ***    'Oh, oh, oh,' sighed the Duchess Anna Henrietta, wringing her hands. 'Your story  distresses me, Mister Geralt. It seizes my heart with sadness.'  She sniffled her nose and reached out her hand, Dandelion at once placed a cambric  handkerchief embroidered with a monogram into it.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"'Probably was injured. And is still in danger. But she  lives.'  Anna Henrietta sighed again and took the handkerchief from Dandelion again. 'I promise you our help and support,' she said. 'Stay in Toussaint as long as you wish.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"The moon shone on the roofs, shining  like diamonds on the ice that hung from the eaves. Roach's horseshoes rang against the  pavement. Roach, thought the Geralt as he headed towards the palace of Beauclair, a graceful grey  mare, a gift from Anna Henrietta. And Dandelion. He urged his horse forwards.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"The poet wore a crimson beret as big as a loaf of  bread and was wearing a doublet of the same colour richly embroidered with gold thread. He   was sitting on a stool with his lute on his knees and his head was nodding carelessly in  answer to the flattery of the courtiers and ladies who circled around him. Anna Henrietta was thankfully not in sight, so Geralt unhesitatingly violated etiquette and  headed straight for him friend. Dandelion saw him coming, swelled and with an imperious  gesture said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, please leave us in private. Also the servants are allow to  leave.'  He clapped his hands and before the echo of his clap returned from the vaulted ceiling of  the hall, only the two of them stood there – and the smell of perfume, which hovered in the  air after the ladies left.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"'What?'  Dandelion snickered, making it blatantly clear what he thought of the judicial decree. 'Third, the maximum penalty... our ladyship Anna Henrietta, Duchess of Toussaint and  Castilian of Beauclair, has kindly switched the penalty for the above crimes, namely being  dragged by horses and dismemberment, by substituting it for decapitation by the axe. Let  justice be done!'  From the crowd came a few incoherent cries. Women standing in the first row pretended  to weep and lament.",The Lady of the Lake,Anna,Dandelion
"The problem,  she continued,  was his companions. The  strange band that he named his company. Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, who had seen  me before and tormented himself to remember where. But he could not remember, because  when I was last in Darn Dyffra, the ancestral home of his family, he was six or seven years  old. Milva, who seemed to be a daredevil and proud girl, but who I twice caught hiding in a  corner of the stables and crying.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
'There are ghosts. I saw... young Count  Cahir aep Ceallach. And he is dead.'  Skellen looked at him but said nothing. 'Lord Stefan...' Dacre Silifant mumbled.,The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"The blond waved  her hand, it was nothing. 'We have to get out of here,' the knight took off his helmet and looked at Ciri. 'I am  Cahir Mawr Dyffryn, the son of Ceallach. I came here with Geralt. To rescue you, Ciri.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"Ciri helped the limping girl. 'You asked for it,' Bonhart narrowed his pale eyes, as he did he twirled his sword. 'Asked for it?' echoed Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach dully. 'No. It is my destiny!'  They rushed towards each other and collided violently.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"But in the Dyffryn house there were  different traditions and they would not change. And had no intention of doing so. At ten years old, Cahir's youngest brother, Aillil was killed in Nazair and was lying in the  castle armoury, due to custom and tradition he was not considered to be a grown man. He was not invited to a gathering of men over the open coffin, but was not allowed to sit  silent alongside his grandfather Gruffyd, his father Ceallach, his brother Dheran or his uncles  and cousins. Understandably, he was neither allowed to mourn and faint in with his  grandmother, his mother, his three sisters or his aunts and cousins.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"Understandably, he was neither allowed to mourn and faint in with his  grandmother, his mother, his three sisters or his aunts and cousins. Small Cahir preferred  running around the walls and fighting with his peers from families who came with their  parents for the funeral, burial and ceremony. Cahir was devoted to making mischief by the  walls. He fought with the other boys who claimed their older brothers fought the bravest at  Nazair and not Aillil aep Ceallach. 'Cahir!",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"'Vilgefortz?' he asked in a sonorous voice. Geralt shook his head. 'Cahir aep Ceallach?'  Another shake of his head. 'A slaughterhouse,' said the officer, looking at the staircase. 'A bloody slaughterhouse.",The Lady of the Lake,Cahir,Ceallach
"Look, inside is a piece of papyrus, with magical red ink that I have, you  just write the name of the loved one and she will never forget or betray you. What do you  think?'  'Hmmm...' blushed Jarre. 'I don't know...'  'What name,' the merchant dipped a quill into his magic ink, 'should I write?'  'Ciri. I mean Ciri.'  'Done. Here you go.'  'Jarre!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"I also heard the name that you had entered  in the heart medallion.'  The dwarf pretended not to notice the blush that suffused the boy's face. 'Keep it up, Jarre. And not only about Ciri... What are you looking at?'  On the wall of a granary visible at the entrance to an alley stood a blurred painting,  written in lime, which read – MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR. Just below, with significantly smaller letters, someone had scrawled the following  message – MAKE SHIT EVERY MORNING.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"Spies are too busy far from the front,  because they are afraid of ending up there themselves. Also, if every soldier who protested,  complained or cursed was hanged, there would be no one to fight this war. But your mouth,  Jarre, as in the case of Ciri, keep it closed. Now come with me, I will escort you to the  Commission office.'  'Mister Cranmer,' Jarre looked with hope at the dwarf. 'Will you speak for me there?'  'You foolish, dandy!",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"It arched its back and rubbed itself on her calf. She stroked the cat and he pushed his head  into her palm, then settled down beside her and began to lick his fur. Ciri watched. She saw Jarre sitting next to a fire in a circle with ugly rogues. They all nibbled at  something that resembled a piece of coal.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"And I feel robbed. Robbed  of the possibility of committing follies. I cannot go madly hurrying after Ciri to help her, I  cannot run like crazy to save Geralt and Yennefer. Not only that, there is a war, which you  have sent your girls... A war, that Jarre fled to and I am refused the possibility to even stand  on a hill.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"The stump of  his hand throbbed with pain. The weather is changing, he thought, it's going to rain. 'Grandpa Jarreeeeee!'  'I'm coming, Ciri. I'm coming.'    ***    Before he was finished with the last of the wounded it was already past midnight. The last  operation was performed under artificial light - lamps, candles and also magic.",The Lady of the Lake,Ciri,Jarre
"And I would gladly dance!'  'On my honour, at the court of Duchess Anna Henrietta, there will be plenty of both,' said  Reynart de Bois-Fresnes. 'Singing and feasting and performances by jugglers, theatre,  music, dancing and poetry in the evenings. You're friends of Dandelion... I man, the  Viscount Julian. And he is very dear to Her Belovedness Our Lady Duchess.'  'And how long he boasted!' Angouleme said.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"'I welcome you to Castle Beauclair in the Principality of Toussaint. I am delighted to  be able to host those who are carrying out such a noble mission. Moreover, you've also been  a friend to our dear Viscount Julian.'  At these words Dandelion bowed deeply. 'The Viscount,' continued the Duchess, 'has revealed to me your names and the reason  and purpose of your mission, and told me what brings you to Toussaint. His story touched my  heart.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"And there was our bunch, including Milva in male attire. Oh, we were poorly expressed. It  was not our whole group, we were missing Dandelion. Dandelion or rather Viscount Julian  was lounging in a chair beside Duchess Anarietta and strutted like a peacock. A royal  favourite.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"But because here, in Toussaint, we pay special  attention to traditions and customs...'  'Get to the point, sir.'  'The banquet is tomorrow. I organise all guests according to their origin and status.'  'Sure,' the Geralt said seriously. 'The most important of us is Dandelion. Both in origin  and status.'  'Viscount Julian,' the Chamberlain said, wrinkling his nose, 'is an extraordinary guest of  honour. As such, he will sit at the right hand of Her Serene Highness.'  'Sure,' repeated the Geralt, with all seriousness.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"He face was no less mournful. 'Citizens of Beauclair and people from the surrounding countryside,' he read in a troubled  voice from parchment. 'Notice is hereby given that Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de  Lettenhove, aka Dandelion...'  'Pankratz what?' Ciri asked in a whisper. '...according to the Supreme Court ruling of this County has been found guilty of all  crimes, offenses and misdeed of which he was accused, insulting Her Majesty, treason of the  state and dishonouring the establishment of the nobility through perjury, libel, and slander,  also for dissipation and indecency, furthermore, obscenity and whoredom. The Tribunal had  decided that Viscount Julian et cetera, et cetera, his receive the following punishment – First,  mortification of his coat of arms, a thick black line through his shield.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"The Tribunal had  decided that Viscount Julian et cetera, et cetera, his receive the following punishment – First,  mortification of his coat of arms, a thick black line through his shield. Second, confiscation of  all his property, both movable and immovable, including lands, forests, castles and palaces...'  'Castles and palaces?' said the astonished Geralt. 'What?'  Dandelion snickered, making it blatantly clear what he thought of the judicial decree. 'Third, the maximum penalty... our ladyship Anna Henrietta, Duchess of Toussaint and  Castilian of Beauclair, has kindly switched the penalty for the above crimes, namely being  dragged by horses and dismemberment, by substituting it for decapitation by the axe.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"'Hush, people!' shouted the bailiff and unrolled the parchment. 'This is the will of  Duchess Anne Henrietta! In her immense goodness and to celebrate the peace of Cintra Her  Ladyship has waived all charges against Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove and  pardons him from execution...'  'My Dear Ermine,' Dandelion said, smiling broadly. '...And orders that the above Viscount Julian et cetera promptly leave the capital and the  County of Toussaint and never return, because his presence is no longer welcome here, and  her Ladyship never wants to lay eyes on him again. You are free, Viscount.'  'What about my property?' the troubadour said indignantly.",The Lady of the Lake,Dandelion,Julia
"When Commander Duke de Wett  learned of the disaster at Brenna and the news reached him that Foltest and John Natalis had  ordered a forced march, he immediately sounded a retreat and in panic fled across the river  to Cintra and escaping significant losses to his troops, because word had gotten around  about Nilfgaard's defeat and a new rebellion was rising in force in Verden. Only troops  remained in the forts of Nastrog, Rozrog and Bodrog and after the Peace of Cintra they  emerged with honour with banners aloft. Meanwhile, in Aedirn, the news of what happen at Brenna caused the antagonised Kings  Demavend and Henselt to join together in arms against Nilfgaard's East Group Army, which  was led by Duke Ardal aep Dahy into the Pontar valley, unable to resist the combined forces  of the two kings. With the addition of the strength of the troops from Redania and the  guerrilla squads of Queen Meve, who undertook combat actions in the rear of the enemy,  they forced Nilfgaard to Aldersberg. Ardal aep Dahy prepared for battle, but due to fate he  suddenly became serious ill, perhaps from spoiled food he got colic and diarrhoea and two  days later died in pain.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt

"'I resent such rude comments, particularly from some fucking spy! I am the fucking anointed  King!'  'It can't be seen at first glance,' Meve muttered. Demavend, turned away from looking at the shields on the rooms walls, smiling with  distain, as if not concerned about the future of his kingdom. 'Enough!' wheezed Henselt, his eyes rolling. 'Enough, by the gods.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"'The Kaedwen army,' fumed Henselt, 'entered the Lower Marches as liberators! My  soldiers were greeted with flowers! My soldiers...'   'Your bandits,' said Demavend calmly, but his face betrayed the effort it cost to stay  calm. 'Your bandits invaded my kingdom, murdered, raped and looted. Lady and gentlemen,  we are gathered here for a week to discuss the future of the world.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"By the gods, is it to be the  face of crime and looting? Should it be maintained in the lawless status quo? Should stolen  goods remain in the hands of thugs and robbers?'  Henselt grabbed a map from the table, tore it in two and with a rapid movement threw it  at Demavend. The King of Aedirn did not even move. 'My armies,' Henselt spluttered, his face turning the colour of a well aged wine, 'won the  Marches from the Nilfgaardians.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"'We will never reach an agreement!'  'Gentlemen,' said Cyrus the hierarch in a conciliatory tone, who until then had been  dozing. 'No doubt, we can always reach some compromise...'  'The Empire of Nilfgaard,' said Shilard, 'does not intend to accept any solution that  would harm the country of the elves of Dol Blathanna. If necessary, My Lords, I will re-read  the content of the memorandum...'  Henselt, Foltest and Dijkstra snorted, but Demavend looked at the Imperial ambassador  calmly, almost benevolently. 'For the good of the people,' he said, 'and to maintain the peace, I acknowledge the  autonomy of Dol Blathanna. But not as a kingdom, but as a duchy.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"The condition is that the  Duchess Enid an Gleanna pay me homage, and is committed to the equality of elves and  humans rights and privileges. I am willing to do this, pro bono.'  'Here,' said Meve, 'are the words of a true king.'  'Salus publica lex suprema est,' added hierarch Hemmelfart, who for some time had  waited for the opportunity to boast of his knowledge of diplomatic vocabulary. 'I would like to add, however,' Demavend continued, looking at the bloated Henselt, 'that  Dol Blathanna's concession is not a precedent. This is the only breach of the integrity of my  lands that I will accept. I will not recognise any additional distributions.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"left!'  They stood at attention in their saddles, turning the horses heads to face the grandstand  and the seats and thrones arranged there. I can see Foltest, Julia thought. The one with the beard must be Henselt of Kaedwen, and  the handsome man is Demavend of Aedirn... That Matron must be Queen Hedwig... And the  boy by her side, Crown Prince Radovid, son of the king that was killed...",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
"Long live Adam Pangratt! Long  live Lorenzo Molla!'  'Long live Constable Natalis!'  'Long live our monarchs! Long live Foltest, Demavend and Henselt!'  'Long live Lord Dijkstra!'  'Long live His Holiness!' A few voices came from the crowd, obviously bribes. Novigrad's hierarch Cyrus Englekind Hemmelfart rose and blessed the people and the army  with his outstretched hands, while irreverently covering Queen Hedwig and young Radovid  with the skirts of his robe. Nobody shouts,  Long live Radovid , thought the prince covered by the hierarch's fat ass.",The Lady of the Lake,Demavend,Henselt
